Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards to change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where young people are meeting today .
a pit @-@ chapel where now for the S @-@ Bahn @-@ Tunnel will be under@@ min@@ ed .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the one @-@ way cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if land@@ cards are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had to look forward to an exciting stage , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a revers@@ ing road showed a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as in Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but just therefore very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compar@@ es them with current online cards .
&quot; then it will be clear , as cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century have changed . &quot;
&quot; the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work , which one does not recognize as such . &quot;
&quot; in the large picture postcard , for cities and municipalities were detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ posi@@ tional sheets , incorporated . &quot;
these were created according to the specifications of the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ measurable administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and skip the first verse Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the second coalition of war with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ o@@ graphic record of Bay@@ erns on behalf of course - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even though the French troops mar@@ ched with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of an area @-@ up Bayern @-@ Map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ o@@ graphic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ measurable Management . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional blatt for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bav@@ arian State Library .
&quot; compared to early / Today , the example of the provincial capital is most impressive . &quot;
the city has expanded itself in all directions and has grown together .
one example is under@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that emerges in the map of 18@@ 56 or relatively isolated .
&quot; Send@@ ling was set up 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as Mün@@ chner district . &quot;
today the sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Lower spring focus around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after 1878 to Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the western park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when editing a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; , derived from which the basic tax has been derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots do not occupy there any farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green space is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 sw@@ ings of the October , was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
in the ur@@ gency of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only reads the street names &apos; at the guest &apos; or from the ascent &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here on the auction @-@ chamber times people were killed people with ins@@ anity . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner district of Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; was created in 18@@ 58 / 59 . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden , the institution - that Psy@@ chiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the dressing of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; in addition , he is forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants &quot; , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; initially , for 280 patients was first place , later was extended to 500 seats . &quot;
at some point these capacity does not happen again - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
&quot; it has been there since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East , one of the largest psychiat@@ rists in Germany . &quot;
at the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt we meet young people at Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
&quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and walked it in a youth home with training . &quot;
&quot; west is the football ground of the TS@@ V Munich East , East residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children @-@ house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; was built in architec@@ tur@@ ally based on the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II at bom@@ bing attacks . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was ranked as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ er@@ straße was &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger street &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies ris@@ sen in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a great stay until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a pit @-@ chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof where this day the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 can take place for the second S @-@ Bahn path . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the a@@ erial view of today - and the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
civil rights group published travel warning for Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the Promotion of In@@ colored has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ souri due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state of Mis@@ souri , who will come into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sou@@ ani@@ ans to take special attention in travel through the state , as a number of frag@@ mentary , r@@ ally @-@ based inci@@ dents in the entire state occur and here &quot; , &quot; it is in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes it harder to win discrimination , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to publish the travel cancellation , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of citizens &apos; rights to pass people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are collap@@ sed or killed , &quot; &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency which we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist forces go against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year , having had no fuel during the journey by the State and taken by the police of Mis@@ souri , without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also pointed out a recent report by the Office of the General State Department of Mis@@ souri , which will be shown that black mot@@ orists in the state shall be 75 percent more common than past@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families , friends and staff to inform about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready if there are chew@@ ing money or the relatives know that they travel through the state .
Mis@@ souri signed up to 100 hate in 2015 according to the latest figures from the hate @-@ reporting program of the F@@ BI - the state in relation to the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law that would make it more difficult to disgu@@ ise a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Code Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) Travel war@@ nings issued for Texas and Arizona , having passed the local prosecution authorities to off@@ ense people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further broad@@ ening agents . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
past@@ oring project is elementary .
the fis@@ her fishing project is a success project and continues to continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have gained a picture on site .
&quot; at the rectangle of the family Schwen@@ dem@@ ann , representatives of the fishing village of CD@@ U @-@ local association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann granted first insights into his farm , in which he served 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cells and as many young animals provided and housed in five apartments holiday guests . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ milk &quot; &quot; is responsible for him of the altern@@ ate mark@@ eter path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ n@@ ann . &quot;
on the table of the guests only regi@@ strar .
&quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he describes the consec@@ ration project as an &quot; elementary project . &quot; &quot;
I can not manage on such steep areas .
&quot; the green space for a lot of work , a lot of need to be edited with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ n@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ ous operation , and processed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers , even if he does not conduct a bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the meaning of the consec@@ ration project and is happy with the leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per h@@ ect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
you hope that the for@@ forest@@ ation of the areas could still be taken out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism for the promotion of
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
&quot; the reserve space is around 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; the total costs of 71 500 Euros was funded by the total cost of 71 500 euro , a quarter carried by the municipality of Fis@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers love the farmers had to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres past@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ n@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and rural women . &quot;
also for Peter White was firm : &quot; here best food is produced . &quot;
the agricultural policy @-@ linear ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg makes it possible to state the state promotion of past@@ as .
the goal is the post@@ ure of the Black Forest .
prerequisite is the presence of one developed by the L@@ PR @-@ named conveyor .
&quot; in addition , the prot@@ ectable surface must not be f@@ ished ( H@@ ang@@ nei@@ gh over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by dis@@ armament . &quot;
&quot; for the fishing project 2018 it is currently running at the request of eight participants with 24 plots , which we would like to build up just 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the reserve space corresponds to 35 hectares , the cold costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime transfer is it when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
&quot; Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the careful over@@ throwing Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp ré@@ g@@ ime , certainly knew what he did , when he took a symbolic A@@ xt in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals made by the President for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not hold the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have suffered him when he had done it .
&quot; but he laid hold on their significance , and in particular the importance that you have written , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; Miller A@@ co@@ sta sh@@ aded : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem which you refer to the later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly informed right , but as he form@@ atted it , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance on the touching words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state will not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your fatigue , your poor , / your depres@@ sed masses , who are going to breathe free , / the el@@ eventh waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; miserable waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller was not committed to liter@@ ary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America .
Lazarus and their friends who put themselves to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they accomplished a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by shown the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she himself gives himself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a dis@@ astrous attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , the people wanted to change from the right wing this long . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not one @-@ load , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , which is the American flame in the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding . &quot;
it shall bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not meant to enligh@@ ten the way into the United States .
pretty unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is entirely at all a matter of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from the exhaustive , but hope@@ ful men after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people , seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever wish to recognise . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch is not meant to enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , which is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish Members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle recalls that at a time when only two shep@@ herds belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member consoles will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; develops and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has done something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle were elected by the team for the team of team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was amazing , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or where they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the genuine feeling , which E@@ ili@@ ie brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth Silver medal , which is at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dle with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 jack@@ ets are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes on the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
Mu@@ ir conduc@@ ts Mu@@ ir on this path and last year five British and two European Re@@ cor@@ ds .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m is running , is another S@@ ote that one should observe the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle recalls her first World Championships as the only other Sch@@ otte in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the occup@@ ants testi@@ fied that they are &quot; &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team but in some cases also in the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special about the team captain in it is that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but to know that my team mates voted for me and chose me to make something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the br@@ isk , who belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise on ships . &quot;
what concerns my speech as chapters ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
&quot; I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home World Championship . &quot;
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadi@@ on .
&quot; I get a second chance to go there , and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block cri@@ tics on Facebook : do not block yourself to a public office if you do not toler@@ ate the inj@@ unc@@ ing of voters
the Father of our land knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers followed him due to all , from internal policy to its political principles . &quot;
he sho@@ ok with criticism .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led to battles to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted , which expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot;
and the American Civil Code declared it this week at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the stops from the Govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as a fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a guy like ho@@ gan@@ ese .
this is a re@@ publi@@ que governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
ho@@ gan@@ ese is not a reactionary heat head .
he showed a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to manipul@@ ate himself with his voters and to debate its hair @-@ free head on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of individuals who come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is to be officially designated as officially and by employees working with public tax currency - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post defending Ho@@ ist Spre@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than a moderation .
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lling or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ tive people , which vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments are respectful , thoughtful , and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor found the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to ho@@ gans of Catholic faith .
&quot; Law@@ yers Lak@@ sh@@ mi sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked for hate . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and gave other current news , she wrote in the comment section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not value this idea if a number of people is taking place on the same subject , then it will be mis@@ used by some more than a so @-@ called collective action , and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors said as &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam attack &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a re@@ viewer or delete a negative comment .
&quot; it is much clean than in former times when you have done the same that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines , to burn or to for@@ ge prot@@ esters and to sweat . &quot;
but this is exactly what is happening in digital .
&quot; Ho@@ gan is not the first public official , which is critic@@ ised for it that he has imp@@ lied Facebook and other social media . &quot;
President Tru@@ mp is lam@@ ented by Twitter @-@ users who were blocked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County gave the first A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she named a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ en ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the internet . &quot;
the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 and anonymous let@@ ins to his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people , the alias &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us &quot; , &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , Washington &apos;s decisions made . &quot;
&quot; Pe@@ ti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised its position on the contract of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation with Great Britain , was overwhel@@ med by the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought them to silence .
&quot; freedom of expression , dis@@ agreements and disc@@ our@@ ses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days in domestic comfort , as the Renaissance Club hosted in East Lot@@ hi@@ an the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who ran last year by side in the Ar@@ cher@@ field left to the final phase , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new location and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen , as the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches his glory with this event , &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot;
Jerry made a great job than he finished this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales will be pleased to defend the championship for the first time , even though he won his 32 @-@ year career in both the European tour and the European Challenge tour . &quot;
&quot; it really feels particularly in , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as it was last year after I won it out of the program . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior Tour before his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional print . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad how far has come .
&quot; with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ othing . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance belong to the six divisions on the field , the others are Andrew Tra@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Drum@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoke
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive cancer . &quot;
these results are the scientists of the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates are due to passive cancer explo@@ ding accidents per year , &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Be@@ cher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved to this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there are still 400 lung cancer inci@@ dents due to passive smoke pro year in Germany . &quot;
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are less fortunate in time , &quot; thus the head of the Bau@@ x Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of pets , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground , there is a lot in the plans , which is not in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is always imp@@ eded into construction , represents a big problem for the work@@ rup@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;

&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Re@@ gent@@ hood in the un@@ quiet ind@@ on@@ esian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually sets a fresh potato off@@ el - locally than &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the shor@@ ten are extracted and swal@@ lowed . &quot;

&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; no one stri@@ ps it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 El@@ der to vote in the occupation of the occupation . &quot;
an existing movement that stir@@ red up for independence against Dutch domination turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta which stops control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observations of it .
&quot; in 2003 , the Province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as was the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses that are surrounded by b@@ ambo@@ o prot@@ ons , and out of cor@@ ru@@ d@@ ots , which were converted by r@@ ust into various yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few Indonesian people have made their journey here , for journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans was a God called U@@ GA Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , and points to their lively , handmade Tur@@ ban , her dark@@ er shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; before , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is the poorest province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s or@@ tal and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ old province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Free@@ port has built a value of 3.2 billion US dollars in gold and copper alone in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; but this wealth are however a source of misery for Pap@@ ua , which is ensuring that Indonesian is a powerful military . &quot;
&quot; a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military operations and units , between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ sian demands after greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden G@@ ans and become mer@@ c@@ il@@ ful .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua has been killed and thousands were tor@@ tured since 1969 by the ind@@ on@@ esian military , tor@@ tured and incar@@ cer@@ ated since 1969 . &quot;
Mass@@ ent@@ ations in the Pap@@ er@@ chief of Pap@@ er@@ ni@@ land in the 1970 @-@ 1990s were referred to as in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police in the past year passed more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we say &quot; &quot; All &quot; &quot; in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from the year 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities are included in the previous year , such as un@@ lawful directions and torture - rape and electrodes are particularly popular - and the brutal rainf@@ all peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since each week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws are reinforced , since Pap@@ uas have an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesian . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ ons sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut . &quot;
local people are fighting for keeping here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua to sell , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to the provincial capital of Com@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the mom &apos;s mom , the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market costs . &quot;
&quot; Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the masses and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , said during his election campaign , the inequalities and the legal violations of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and now the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children out there and sang Christmas fly before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the dark .
the sc@@ ro@@ cked children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took impetus to her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , they said and smote the group with her tissue col@@ ouring , said sacrifices and witnesses . &quot;
then fought one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard stri@@ pped that he fell into the com@@ a . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby Government Commission was set in fire and the things escal@@ ate the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football ground in front of the local police station and the Military Commander center to demand justice . &quot;
they bore cerem@@ onial hunting and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ minded im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ er@@ me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to tow the stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers got a command over an internal radio : &quot; when the masses have more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is not released in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not approved by local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ w@@ d danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned out , I was suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes w@@ rists , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; kay@@ ame still does not know who has frozen , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the people gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were folded , &quot; adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the ar@@ chery was . &quot;
&quot; I burned to him and studied his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who carries only one name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the Che@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters that his officers wanted to secure their station only &quot; &quot; save &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the speaker of Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more hurt . &quot;
the messages about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; for three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate talk in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and fluctu@@ ating to address historical abuse in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case will immediately be solved , so that in future it will no longer happen in the future . &quot;
&quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he may set out a out @-@ out mechanism for sett@@ ling historical violations of human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were included in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through . &quot;
&quot; then , Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said , he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , all is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , accused the UN because of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights victims in the Pap@@ ua has already been announced that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua has already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Vor@@ if . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ers un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still alive in fear later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot;
&quot; his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view , that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident . &quot;
he says he was be@@ aten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; says he . &quot;
the sho@@ wering have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , died one person and 17 others were in@@ jured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ w@@ ned when he was in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the sit@@ ing office of the company , &quot;
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers were stones to officers , who re@@ acted re@@ acted by the war@@ nings . &quot;
but natives say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ il@@ it@@ ary police ) began to shoot the amount of shooting and a killed .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness as the past here is quick to be supplied , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to account the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police in the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a her@@ ru@@ gated board for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of sensual development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the Chief Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al that live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ u@@ sian army , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by taking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to the past few years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and transferred to custody , under the pretext of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never dive again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is for locals too expensive .
bread is just as far apart .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and blood @-@ vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of Sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a precious just 10.000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic inequalities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants are grown , who have arrived in greater numbers since opening new flight routes to the umbi@@ lical airport . &quot;
the few jobs which exists in the region usually go to the better trained and wealthy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to perform their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the reporting of international media are tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ aries and Basi@@ cs Long@@ cham@@ p were ported , because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they gave them the rare permission to the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Deputy @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaign , to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indon@@ esi@@ ens un@@ quiet east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ism .
&quot; in March , six Pa@@ zi@@ ffer states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ til@@ u , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands - the UN Human Rights Council - to investigate the &quot; various and widely spread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to tu@@ alize the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Com@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th visited , bru@@ te natives , and than@@ ked him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated at the meeting , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia also has another presidential election , but Pap@@ ua said that they probably will not be able to vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Executive Board . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ People , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a r@@ aci@@ an army , is in im@@ pover@@ ished educ@@ ators and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai guys , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; , &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ lation brought a last symbolic act of the f@@ ool : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried on a terrain right opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never enter justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with anoin@@ ting head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scr@@ aper from Dubai to the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai to flee hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt in just two years through the flood , which you can coinci@@ de the tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injury were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept , and we are up with fire alarm and when sharing the people up . &quot;
&quot; we turned down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; told an inhabitants named his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fight against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 : GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building was removed . &quot;
&quot; the government said , she is working on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can rev@@ itali@@ ze questions on the safety of materials , which are used in outer areas of skyscrapers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ Building after its fire in 2015 was revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the outer cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell @-@ Tower in June have contributed to the rapid spread of a surge in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is performed with its big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposition , Davis Cup single is only supported to play two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ set classics will remain the traditional competitor . &quot;
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states agreed to reform the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only a little missing .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members had not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I will continue to work , to improve the competitors . &quot;
&quot; not until the vote was not only for the vote before the proposal , the finale had come to a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists will have the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future during the first round of the host law .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements in terms of training sets are reli@@ eved and the players will have to complete the official media dates prior to the Davis Cup . &quot;
more than 1 of 5 US travelers de@@ filed items into the plane , finds a survey out of &quot;
&quot; a survey among passengers received , that more than 20 per cent be aware or un@@ aware items to the check@@ points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which bore the plane , while they acci@@ dentally du@@ red kni@@ ves or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; said less than 1 per cent , they were bel@@ ated that they were traveled with bul@@ lets , amm@@ o or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ter Inc . , also noted that younger travelers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; requested by the respon@@ dents , the states that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned from T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items that were infected at T@@ SA agent , were foods and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent added to , know@@ ingly items with blades supported by the safety control , whereas 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also affir@@ med that they have inten@@ tionally killed drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , there were travellers in the whole country to find out how many failed sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ oss were brought by the airport security and how many things were inten@@ tionally done . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that people who are most sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ am@@ ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - by security , those who were most frequently fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often uns@@ ure which liquids may take them with or how much of them .
&quot; so , there is no surprise that the biggest amount of the items made by the T@@ SA are dec@@ eived by liquids . &quot;
&quot; a time for the people , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; fluids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is to cancel no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers
&quot; with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for its new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far assumed that a part of the customer has withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the continually triumph@@ ant figures on sales growth and even gigantic sales aim , Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has betra@@ yed a different , less gl@@ it@@ tering number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k has often applied in recent months with more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery begins . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k is a : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics always had pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; when cancellation pays Tes@@ la the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations in front of , covered Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts . &quot;
&quot; however , that cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could be given to the problem , the Tes@@ la chef does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge among the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; in the past year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 cars delivered . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 it should be taken together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 for one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations day reservations . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; may be considered early in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la it creates , its n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , never in practice tested production lines with no greater inter@@ rup@@ tions to drive with maximum utilisation . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to larger delays , then the in@@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot stop dis@@ satisfied customers in swe@@ ar . &quot;
EPA manager P@@ ru@@ ction moves back to reducing emissions from the rules of Obama to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after being lam@@ ented by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , to delay its former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ other air pollution . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes , as its agency proved to be the requirements of state environmental authorities vis , compared to the previous administration . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit which was raised against his previous office in a Federal Ministry of Education .
&quot; it is a time limit , which ran on 1 October for states to meet the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ up o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; proclaimed in June , that he will delay the compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid getting into local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who had been prosec@@ uted by President Donald Tru@@ mp prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , for a long time it was a reliable opponent in the environmental protection rules . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeatedly has gone to block or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal envelope for the P@@ ru@@ ction regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Ministry of Education in Washington decided that the EPA administration has passed its authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ ane mor@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in one on the Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ k@@ itt suggested that his K@@ ehr@@ um at Oz@@ on@@ standards simply hit the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely performance of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administration , the EPA has often not met the deadlines for implementation and then waited to establish the appointment of activists and others , and said in an agreement to set up the appointment for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who agreed to the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by jurisdiction , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority , who gives us seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA is that forced to use his &apos; authorization to delay and all the other legally available authority &quot; to make sure that the rules &apos; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress are pushing for a broader re @-@ form of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; one last month approved law@@ suits , the implementation of the rules of 2015 should be delay at least eight years . &quot;

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain Church , the old cemetery A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock at a Seren@@ ade . &quot;

Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique villages . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned first mentioned in the Württemberg &apos;s Ur@@ sel : Graf Hermann from Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the rec@@ alled church &quot; &quot; Magi@@ ster E@@ ber@@ hard von Hor@@ b , and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the certificate according to the document , on the tumor mountain , there was also a splendid farm , to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; what goes forth out of the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , in addition to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today in the village of Tum@@ lingen there are still to be recognized , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glorious settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ mines this historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ym was born from the early medieval self @-@ law .
&quot; a Lord who built a church , held and occupied with a pastor , continues to be owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this own church too . &quot;
associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor .
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Greater of the two zer@@ are@@ st at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rack then first in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows and the bell @-@ parts were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
17@@ 96 enc@@ amped French troops close to the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the Church in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead from listening . &quot;
18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ d church has been abandoned .
only the cherry tower left there .
in the New Year of 18@@ 34 a storm over@@ turned the cherry and half cr@@ ashed one .
&quot; to prevent a mis@@ fortune , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only the still existing tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history .

the Seren@@ ade takes place only in dri@@ er weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers are hoping for many supporters of the historical St. Hil@@ arius complex , which is of importance to tum@@ ours and listening . &quot;
&quot; the friends and sponsors feel particularly committed to the homeland care , such as Seren@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini . &quot;
association aims to test authorization from wind wheels
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ eding &quot; does not see any legal preconditions for the building and has therefore turned towards the Council . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ eding &quot; has prompted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ ils ( CD@@ U ) to take its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ om@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette could not have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen only on the border to swal@@ lows a wind power concentration zone .
&quot; within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the concentration zone results in the wind power for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city four months ago had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the district government in Düsseldorf had not approved , because of a form@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirements , the authorized authorization is still illegal and therefore to take back , &quot; said Christoph Erk@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : the city council has once again decided prior to the summer break , the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette decided ; a approval of the district government is still standing . &quot;
&quot; recognizing : &quot; in this point , the classification of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the challenge .
&quot; the corresponding writing has been noted since last week in the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; said one speaker . &quot;
the circle takes them the occasion to consider the matter again .
&quot; however , they are expected not to be stopped that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the running method of the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express itself out of the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , an subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette construction of four to 200 metres high wheels . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company had participated in which the city quad@@ rup@@ tly participated in which the city of four @-@ eight hectares with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large gels were closed . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the power consumption of all four @-@ sized households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , quad@@ rup@@ tions gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as an participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the circle Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor trucks : woman dies in an aw@@ ful accident
one deter@@ rent traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn ) .
a woman was fatal .
two more persons were easily violated .
the provincial road was locked over hours .
according to police officers a 17 @-@ year young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch went by Bor@@ ni@@ ch with their passenger in the frame of the accompanying ride with her 53 @-@ year mother as accompan@@ im@@ ent the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; Home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bath Langen@@ lo@@ za@@ er and people from the region should discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
&quot; the profession , and the municipal authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants of the shopping cart in the city center . &quot;
&quot; as the chair of the profession , Christian König , announced the &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; weekend the customers should raise awareness of which offers the city &apos;s own city away from the usual supermarket . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local firms should present themselves with their educational movements . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the inner city should invite for the &quot; Mit@@ ter@@ night@@ club . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the promotion is not only on residents of the city and the closer region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bag , which refer to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal management and commercial ren@@ ditions are working together with the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce .
&quot; thus , the commercial ren@@ ditions are entering into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive City &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ day &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest with sold @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move them to the active participation . &quot;
even attractive offers to Saturday and the reference to Park@@ fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be newly or re@@ united . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many natives have lost the city center when shopping comes from the view .
&quot; at the end , everyone would need to help to rev@@ itali@@ ze the city center - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it came to overcome the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , with a network that had done partly , had said the king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ g@@ it Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Centers in Müh@@ l@@ hausen distributed to participate in the nationwide third &quot; &quot; home shop &quot; &quot; day , for the first time in five Thur@@ in@@ gia cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ lei@@ cher@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ ves &quot; &quot; promote the esteem of local trade and its importance for the common good of our cities stronger , &quot; &quot; says . &quot;
the promotion carried out by the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence its purchase with its purchase behavior .

Tru@@ mp sat down by dra@@ fted tran@@ scription by teleph@@ ony Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription by telephone call between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp called on a call with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to be able to publicly say that he would not pay for an planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President accused him , because he had announced the wall of publicly challenged . according to him , he said to him , &quot; What can you not say the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall on the southern border of the USA , and fluctu@@ ate , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first appeal with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m gymn@@ asium were also published and un@@ covered a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull that immig@@ rant for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; , &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was proposed by the Obama administration , having proposed him as a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; , &quot; after he proposed a ban to the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ aker : activists guide rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury was driving through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and ru@@ mp@@ ed on the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with tissues to block its path . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looked after by the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; brood the man . &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; Schre@@ ie sm@@ ashed the silence , when a young black man was sm@@ iled from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , only a follow @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop around the neck from &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , there are almost everybody in the audience very real si@@ gh . &quot;
since 2005 citizen &apos;s right back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it really is un@@ thin@@ kable that in all these years was not a single person arrested , although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps the organisation of delivery . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that a w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want offen@@ ders , we want to end , we want healing , we want healing , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a court lon@@ er places a bed towel over the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding neighborhoods were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but nobody was ever charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on open foot for decades , civil rights , that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch &apos;s actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the first time in Georgia for the first time to conc@@ ede their voice in the summer . &quot;
&quot; at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the details of the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ e Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said , the smells in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried , not of her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when she got away from prison , and called the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b turned the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ ning , includes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a complete between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , proo@@ fs and identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it even more pronounced .
&quot; it was a constitu@@ ent mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
for nearly a decade he has led C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene the annual announcement of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; her representation is illustr@@ ative , gri@@ pping , and is based in a kind of deep racism , of which many believe he is no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about Lyn@@ chen , because we are confronted with its stap@@ le in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have through .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen past@@ ure and the rest bl@@ acks - into a space and lou@@ dly , as a Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief &apos;s C@@ lan@@ der &apos;s role for years , but he said that the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the t@@ ester , and depres@@ sed , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , disappeared from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona wi@@ pes the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs on the lau@@ re@@ test .
&quot; what ? ! , asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ ck@@ ering . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos;@@ n --- he said .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ted one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and that is exactly where the energy in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everybody is busy to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four sol@@ dered people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , if Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends non@@ violent and fast .
&quot; there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , cloth@@ ed with a mour@@ ning , stands on the corp@@ ses of the actors and performs tri@@ lli@@ on Holidays &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks down with every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come only the road . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced every eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; until this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders found , the air feels radi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if the last notes of the song will sound , Gre@@ ene loads a lot closer to come closer and to insp@@ ect the corp@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken in their heads , record the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ ders a little boy , as if he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank Gre@@ ene ) and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ l@@ eil away and wi@@ pe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aced Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man in the An@@ ders who played the C@@ lan@@ der .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of its players and then breaks into their arms together ; the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience deals with the actors for dinner together . &quot;
at a table a white pair from Atlanta stimulated via the follow @-@ up with a black pair that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought for words to find words which have left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you themselves and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me , let me believe that Lyn@@ n is still going on &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; today , the only police @-@ shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks yard holds on his table , he e@@ ats and re@@ members to the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the delivery is inspiring in some ways , as it describes the horror of what we have end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever has not studied his own history , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iling the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental works , director Frank Cast@@ or@@ f is based on a multic@@ ol@@ vo@@ le st@@ aging of gigantic , six @-@ story scenery . &quot;
&quot; the stage stage ( designed by Ale@@ k@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either an ou@@ tra@@ ded street corner with a mas@@ onry and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the Rhin@@ e@@ er posi@@ eren as rock erg@@ om@@ ls more posi@@ eren , or alternatively an is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; oil floo@@ ding oil remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ mot@@ if - money , power and greed - that moves through its &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three k@@ iller is sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cau@@ tioned they perform Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cr@@ ush in Hollywood man@@ ier a corp@@ se in the trunk and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the glorious Ha@@ gen that surrounds the au@@ ra of a wei@@ ght@@ box@@ ers .
brutal the scene as he strikes Sieg@@ fried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must believe .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .
&quot; stor@@ my is celebrated in Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who are humble and bound hands on Merkel @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; big applause is available for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance was anticipated by Frank Cast@@ or@@ f and his Regi@@ ons .
&quot; in 2013 he had to let go one @-@ going pipe concert in 2013 , there were five years later big J@@ bel , in which the &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; Ru@@ fe went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Kath@@ arina Wagner is likely to have been pleased .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown with the &quot; ring &quot; in some way , &quot; she had said briefly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ or@@ f , but it was also a understanding of its view . &quot;
I have a positive reset .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture , once a week I put here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open day @-@ day at school .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ appointed volunteer . &quot;
how does this come about ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , we say , successfully abandoned . &quot;
&quot; I have known for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , with people working . &quot;
and then I wondered what you do .
&quot; a social year , there is a glimpse , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual study , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne is a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not something unusual during the volunteer service to have several different types of application ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it seems at ease where one makes his FS@@ J .
one can do it from Alter@@ sheim to Ju@@ gen@@ dar@@ ing - in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social labour .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that has mat@@ ured me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
different than in the civil engineering study ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
&quot; one has always had other human beings , which each have a very different story behind . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you have to always take care of it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have a touch of touch ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
it is a area that gives a lot .

EPA takes decision to delay the smo@@ g @-@ rule according to ca@@ vities
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , abol@@ ished what the states are obligated to capture the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 countries def@@ endants the Agency because of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ances 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in June , the intention was announced in June the intention of the EPA to set the oz@@ on@@ site in which in a part of the country poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions must be measured to set stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay in more stringent air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , traveled on Tuesday K@@ situation and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to re @-@ rise a broad range of environmental templates , which the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which should boost economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the resign@@ ation of the Democrats and nature groups that are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; pul@@ mon@@ y &quot; &quot; reduce the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and increase the symptoms of symptoms such as as@@ thma . &quot;
community wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counterparts that decides the community of Flu@@ id @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln the establishment of a Community space in the future senior residence . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing basic piece was signed , &quot; says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last , until the far @-@ party community of belonging to the parish , there is now no plans for the project from a private investor to st@@ ating project . &quot;
there is a discussion about a shared area .
&quot; one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has been offered to the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the community are flo@@ ats , such a common room , not as a meeting place just for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ able living room , but open to the congregation . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word of &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Go &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this case , the decision will be decided by providing funds for the running household already last autumn , by funding possibilities . &quot;
the building is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a communal space would be , so tells T@@ j@@ ads , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the resolution proposed to signal the investor that you don &apos;t want to throw him in this respect that both Satt@@ el@@ - - which reduces the ambient temperature - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach , which makes the height @-@ height and construction of economic power - will be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so not only Wil@@ fred Soh@@ in , be this promise . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously happens the body .
not so easy it goes to the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which you can not move so right now , but now you rest for the common room from the window , says it : &quot; I do it hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely essential for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
&quot; it sees behind it a covered sub@@ stitution in any case , or even foreign investors . &quot;
&quot; that is not so , because with the purchase of the surface you do not give a grant , but get a real , in doubt , is counter@@ able , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; stat@@ s request , in accordance with the decision of decision , finds three supporters . &quot;
&quot; thus , it remains with two counterparts in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller contains so together : &quot; &quot; if we put the decision so , we make a giant step forward , a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

hike in the Har@@ z from Stern to Stern
in Har@@ z the nationwide first &quot; Star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is supposed to arise .
this is planning the association observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary way is there in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; Star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; come forward to the needs of many har@@ z@@ atten@@ dees , called it . &quot;
&quot; it connects with nature , science , exercise and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to exhibit along the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures .
&quot; in the first phase up to 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ reaching installations on five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question Che@@ ms St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards shall be added via internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception is playing a good mobile network reception . &quot;
accessibility is a criterion .
later the star@@ pf@@ ad train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ ring track the spect@@ ator experienced a lot of useful information , for example , about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star grows more lumin@@ aire than another , even though he is much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which constellation will be an selected star , and when it is best to see . &quot;
the association has been operating since 2014 at the St. Andre@@ as@@ berg &apos;s largest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
&quot; located in the heart of the Har@@ z National Park , the Federal Ministry for Nature Conservation is one of the six dark@@ est regions of Germany . &quot;
&quot; often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible with naked eye . &quot;
in the Uni @-@ city there has been on the initiative of Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen something similar to the planned star@@ wer@@ g - the planetary road .
&quot; starting before Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e that forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary road leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community equals ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the legs with the individual planets - including the tu@@ b@@ ted dit@@ to on the end - are exactly in the distance and measure of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks so on a sphere of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun is about 70 meters away from the sun at least 70 cen@@ timet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planetary distance is about four kilometers .
&quot; when the light of sun is needed up to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians also need a good hour to go with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestrian are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ stern but would still take a half year .

&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; reminded pra@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I rose to Bron@@ n &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run on light weight .

this demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko agreed to .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that will fight Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pounds debut in this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) which has also been an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell at the Forum on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and expressed themselves later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighters , &quot; and may possibly take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;

four Ob@@ last to tire @-@ Plat@@ zer
on Thursday afternoon four people were seriously wounded during an accident on the A7 trunk .
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost just before the connecting market market , probably after a tire @-@ plat@@ zer , control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car par@@ ted to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he struck up and then lying on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were seriously wounded during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the past through the lif@@ ebo@@ ats service the A7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , then the traffic could be run on the left @-@ strip at the accident . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Trinity works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 to the season pr@@ el@@ ude against Braunschweig , that brings the optimization of the def@@ enses at Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first end game , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result also , since not the two oppos@@ ites had been with 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defensive player from Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triangle is to be further optimized .
&quot; and a gate after a fre@@ eing , the For@@ tun@@ ers want to get even more influenced . &quot;
&quot; for the future , it will be that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) will be on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right after the experiences in preparation with the Trinity .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will be acting in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helmet radio , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , because we have just been able to build on the semi @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann player who can build up well &quot; , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the condition is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we cannot afford so many ab@@ play@@ able errors . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one cannot speak after an un@@ inten@@ ed start , I do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly speak of a decent season . &quot;
of this his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start of the season , I evaluated only after six to eight game days , &quot; said Fried@@ helmet radio , who doesn &apos;t want to talk of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken due to a we@@ ather@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e might be even something fresh , since they have no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a ascension fav@@ oured in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; says the defen@@ ders of the Fortuna . &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland are going to be easily favour@@ ites on Sunday in the encounter in finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we take them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first Six is ble@@ eds , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is very positive in just one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from before , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chef@@ coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement to meet would be arro@@ gant and over@@ sized . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um assessment tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for the medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested older than 18 years are . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ory Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ shor@@ n ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
&quot; they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration flows ) because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees were critici@@ zed years old . &quot;
&quot; until today , mig@@ rations has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person may &apos; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion that the person may be &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
&quot; according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person has been judged for over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers has to be above his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the studied person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det tested the 5@@ 81 results , she realized that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical assessment , made in the x @-@ ray recording of wisdom teeth and resonance @-@ recordings of knee joints , who are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological ri@@ pe of people to see if they went earlier or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
to assess biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we cannot say it safe , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk lies in it if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well progres@@ sing .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of emphasis on the bridge was installed at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold E@@ asi@@ ly , Bau@@ der at the Department of Culture and Transport in the Di@@ vin@@ ce Freiburg . &quot;
in April the works started at the same time in all three @-@ urban bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge from concrete , which is lined with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now fully refurbished . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so called br@@ acing cap . &quot;
this is a side attachment that is also used as operating path .
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , on Friday a 2,@@ 20 meters wide brid@@ ge@@ cap will be used . &quot;
after that then the pedestrian road go away .
&quot; the particular thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented connectors .
special finger@@ tips has the multip@@ lication of the cables by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass label for which many firms are connected .
the inhabitants were informed in advance of work by hand@@ writing about the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and canc@@ ers had to be eliminated . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the construction of the building and the collecting , towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is full . &quot;
the costs for the three ro@@ ckets are 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it does not come so often that parties occur in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes along what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the connected parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows on this day peace@@ full flag because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites to &quot; large constitu@@ tive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the leading cause of the Bundestag on the 24th of September , and the dep@@ uty Chairman of the Be@@ at@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the ground before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D specialists , but demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colourful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the fountain site , but now on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that has to offer .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the forum A world and one of the major organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police has many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ d have actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ d volcan@@ ic reports reported that he endeav@@ ored to make such an event and get the surcharge .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old out of G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built @-@ built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ ce cherry is not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so the ond@@ ell , hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : against 20 clock ensures a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the rh@@ et@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz , af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 list@@ ener , who are waiting for the peak @-@ did@@ atin for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the Be@@ at@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold her speeches . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; somewhat more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short notice after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can fall down - no special needs .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a return with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the Kloster@@ kirche . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian Tromp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ ar , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; Black Sea &quot; &quot; or even &quot; &quot; Bal@@ can@@ es &quot; &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in the bladder music . &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winner and winners of numerous international competitions and have held Sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top @-@ orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ay is the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both united the desire to cross not only the limits on their instruments , but also to merge the limits of the various gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; it sounds like Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ a@@ str@@ aus@@ gers N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , mixing Classi@@ cal , jazz and the free games to an intrigu@@ ing complete art work . &quot;
this core part of the program was only listed this spring with ri@@ tist success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has written it for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Monastery with its particular acous@@ tics will be consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese , and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart completely openly about their bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; when I am in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the probably best known relationship of the Dut@@ y@@ ang stars was the one to her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally got bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all that ass@@ ures the br@@ ittle Dar@@ stell@@ ar to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with love , which I didn &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I could have played it ? &quot;
after their separation Kri@@ sten became that they have bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed in it .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them suffered them according to &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but in school time when they prefer like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
I felt really attacked and frigh@@ tened .
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public they don &apos;t like to love their love life , &quot; people expect you to a certain way and the anno@@ yed me . &quot;
&quot; and maybe some call me as und@@ own , but I don &apos;t like it to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night with a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and many re@@ think ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the r@@ ally broke out in J@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp met before a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice approved not the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes introduces that he has inherited K@@ ohl@@ em@@ inen in five states , and inherited from his father a carbon business . &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday night announced a statement in which it said : &quot; &quot; the Party of Govern@@ mental Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would lead to us rather than ever to work our country again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ ements and control of the least legal entity in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , introductory message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement on the CB@@ S News . &quot;
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for intelligence sc@@ andal
&quot; the global leader of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an apparent ap@@ ology from Russia to a mental sc@@ andal , but he repeti@@ tive it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics chef D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress , that the ban@@ ishment of his country was correct from the sport and that he determined to fight the mental doping . &quot;
&quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; all athletes , which were gra@@ yed at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite its comments , the IA@@ AF Congress was voted for the maintenance of the Forbidden City , which was published in November 2015 , after a report to the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( W@@ ada ) references to state @-@ funded intelligence in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ president Co@@ e to re@@ por@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized itself with itself that she experienced some pretty hot times , and everything will do to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; he said , he also enjoys &quot; &quot; pleased , &quot; &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start in the athle@@ tics world Championships , which begin on Friday in London , after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still fulfil some of the criteria for re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and botan@@ icals are still free , he said re@@ por@@ ters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
grape act for in Mali
at a f@@ uneral party in the nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ian F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar around 1000 people of the two have thought of a helicopter crash in Mali &apos;s dec@@ aying soldiers .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security measures .
&quot; for yet un@@ resolved , Secretary of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) nothing . &quot;
&quot; they called the two revers@@ ed pil@@ ots , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of her specialist . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we pret@@ end to this highest sacrifice that they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year Stab@@ ern@@ mann of Nord@@ h@@ essen had come alive on Wednesday before a week in the West African Mali .
their sins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total weakness of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at lun@@ ch@@ time only the members of the church were f@@ arewell .
&quot; after that , the mour@@ ning ceremony began in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
below were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general leader of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; sad@@ ness rose to ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm at the s@@ är@@ gen . &quot;
in front of the church F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas .
Secretary of Defense was decorated by the Le@@ yen the revers@@ ed soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and in@@ separ@@ ating .
the Stab@@ ern@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has been built in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and had been one of the first six trained tiger pil@@ ots of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , to which the soldiers belong , explained : &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , then it would not have missed . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali showed prime minister in the Le@@ yen not : the use was dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a land , of which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the f@@ uneral party the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are pun@@ ched , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide information . &quot;
Prinz Hen@@ rik does not want to be a tomb next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to pun@@ ish after his death in addition to his wife . &quot;
this divided the Royal House on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish kingdom is positioned in the church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ha@@ g for the two .
&quot; the queen did not agree with the decision of her husband , it was in the message . &quot;
where Prinz Hen@@ rik will be buried there is still unclear .
but he did not have the intention to be placed in his French home .
Prinz Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he went to retirement and also sets the title &quot; princ@@ esses &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik in Denmark does not have the title and function he wanted , he sees himself against his wife as equal - even not after death , explained L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the boss @-@ speaker at the Danish kingdom . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old may be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the intention of being placed in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ sex , had come to know Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked at the Thames in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later woman the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prinz Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk s@@ lam@@ inated instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation had to be the brand of soci@@ o@@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were the same two bugs ! &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil wants to be swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; low @-@ informed Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is returning to the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
because he spoke out on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising exit of a Green Party in Nieder@@ sachsen had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its scar@@ ce a @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ ears set up its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U Fra@@ tion@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its group to record them .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP could have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony day , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was reverse .
the new land@@ day will be re @-@ elected on 14th January of the year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green national government must now decide whether they can no longer rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan W@@ eil considers it essential to conf@@ use its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through its further action .
the state of state also sees the possibility that the state @-@ day of the Prime Minister withdraw the trust and elect a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these options have to be legally tested legally , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , one will discuss all the questions if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ wes@@ terly step &quot; but something short of short .
the policy @-@ maker himself said : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it turned out as a tra@@ der of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the dep@@ u@@ ties to the return of their land day .
&quot; we don &apos;t matter of course that she has received their land sm@@ and@@ at that has given them over the green state list , shared with immediate effect , shared the national CEO of Meta Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the Group Leader of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
they have deliberately decided to have no pr@@ on@@ unciation in the group .
&quot; also against the background that there were no content differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ chan@@ cell@@ an@@ did@@ at Martin Schulz condemned the superi@@ ority of the Lower Saxony @-@ Members El@@ ke T@@ ails to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the constitu@@ ents and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the director of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) , to quickly choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
the resign@@ ation of T@@ wes@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Nieder@@ sachsen the majority .
&quot; the policy @-@ chief &quot; &quot; in its ver@@ ultimate van@@ ity and in their frustration , their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U takes part in Lower Saxony of this dirty breeding and tries to strike it political capital .
precip@@ itation of CD@@ U @-@ fra@@ gment Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler would recommend its MEPs to include El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the frac@@ tion@@ e@@ ef of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , bow@@ ed T@@ jack@@ ets before , with personal career giving the result of the elections of the Federal Republic of 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD strong power , SPD and Green , in the Land@@ tag , but an orph@@ an majority of one voice . &quot;
&quot; agricultural Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ eces , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
&quot; agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , in the interview with the Board Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer . &quot;
&quot; Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ing eggs ? &quot;
&quot; I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumers , watching the eggs in your refrigerator and review the stamp @-@ print . &quot;
at the consumer portal www.@@ g@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de the federal states present the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ gen .
sufferers should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; also , if after all we are currently knowing a health haz@@ ard practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best crisis reaction - all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ tening of Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately raised up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold @-@ selling products are well @-@ capable and harmless .
&quot; if in eggs of the back high levels of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not transportation . &quot;
&quot; Un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time is not the companies to blame .
sit production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after the final level of knowledge the production sector meets no immediate guilt .
&quot; rather , they must reck@@ on due to mut@@ ation of illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is a little control in the harvest .
is it only lacking in the staff or also on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
&quot; it was just the official controls , which have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; for truth , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; this is why a consistent education of such acts and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ations in the cases , in which criminal off@@ ences can occur , of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made clear several times that I expect from the responsible authorities a complete enlightenment . &quot;
is the regular alarm m to food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and limited food .
&quot; if a non @-@ yellow insec@@ ti@@ cide used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly emp@@ tied . &quot;
&quot; by excav@@ ated means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers have come into a situation which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cides Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the attitude of food goods is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
&quot; in this case , it has to be consistent with high pressure on all levels . &quot;
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are quickly and fully resolved .
how to impact the financial control of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent further issues of the European football stadium , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain by the UEF@@ A , because the leading organization monitors the power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which was launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G must eventually prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars in view of the financing of the team by the energy rich rulers of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations may contact lots of money for the purchase of players , but must be able to control them with legitimate income sources , which allow them to make the break @-@ up point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini in accordance with his election as a UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; former French player believed that associations in their quest for success had taken enormous debt to himself , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then powerful investment to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 was fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will still reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P in comparison with The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package case , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year deal contract so that the resolution can be issued for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million in annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P @-@ sanctions in 2014 has reached the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G was awarded a cash prize of 60 million euros ( back to 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged , that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise ordinary 25 players remains limited . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is searching for clubs that could attempt to over@@ see their financial supervision by connecting their revenues by companies , who are connected with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could increase the PS@@ G , if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsorship of the P@@ SA was paraly@@ sed by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the organisational committees of the World Cup 2006 could occur .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have been disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar WM ambassador will be easy to find out for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , every attempt to observe the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , called on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the recent published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated sales of 5@@ 4@@ 2.@@ 4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year will have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ ggers . &quot;
the association is assum@@ ing that sales after signing at least 30 percent will increase .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly ir@@ oned to see one of the best football players going to see , and they tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s way@@ train by declar@@ ing that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial intelligence &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars last owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose society is owned by an American sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a State that is a society funded . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed completely the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because one has different ways or have different interests when one country has such a large actor in order to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is in search of a new ver@@ og@@ gi@@ ers
in the past few years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ chocolate manufactured for Swiss Life .
now the local cooperation stands in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the order new .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ cher@@ in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency SD@@ A a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ wes@@ terly &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will open a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white Sho@@ wers Sho@@ gg@@ it@@ af@@ ers distributed to 14 grams per year the flight companion before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss does not want to do so on the cost of Swiss .
&quot; industry manufacturers value the order volume according to &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is all@@ em@@ al of the advertising effect : for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ers it is an prestigious job .
&quot; as many applicants there are in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper Report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the contract via spring 2018 . &quot;
for the SD@@ A the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate bars spread Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before Swiss closed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Cal@@ leb@@ aut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
the possibility to place the logo led Swiss to two and a half years with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ way flights , customers of First Class with treats from the Con@@ f@@ eria Spr@@ ün@@ gli are spoiled , in Business Class Nas@@ chen Pass@@ gg@@ i from Lind@@ t and Economy Class Sho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time , nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of 80 @-@ he years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV turned ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to major things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as franchise , it feels like the time was short . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for an speaking d@@ ant vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
by lowering himself on the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle aged children playing games that will grow - they still managed to gain the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the widow .
&quot; ten years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , which are now playing adults , is less emotional @-@ rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the found@@ ries of the Stal@@ ker films like &quot; The hand , Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; The hand , the cradle &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; one point is a character by an Apple Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ tor , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) still not forgotten . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant P@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) that is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
as always the lessons are the best part of the franchise .
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ illons Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ che of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of accidental mad@@ ness that could make this franchise may be like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I will show as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; will visit how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon recalls another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ ing @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ edy by Brian Gat@@ ov and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , gives a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main gri@@ lling - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic j@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt be synchronized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice gig to watch ( the police spends the time to watch chess on TV like Americans may do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of the famous speaker - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ ers@@ hal@@ a Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is so very committed to the true propaganda of propaganda propaganda - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is included - that it is often like a single one . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , there is going to be , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , which was re@@ arranged on a lower length , his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re could deliver better , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby always occupied by two thick males who disappeared a bunch of bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ery communist audience is that Western culture can make all the food for a gel .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
a blow to Dru@@ m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched out , such as the Prosec@@ ution Kon@@ stanz on Friday . &quot;
15 compl@@ ain@@ ees were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years ago and had already en@@ acted in arrest warran@@ t against them .
&quot; in addition , officials set greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , bul@@ lets and several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same ro@@ swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany .
at the action Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators participated .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia will be organised crime criminal , severe violence , attempted murder as well as smoking and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the Prosec@@ utor of Constance are determined by the organised drug administration in the South German region . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ ut@@ ties in Constance and Palermo , a lively exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; into the visor of the investigations , especially Italian national , with respect to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; a incident took place on 27 May in Hü@@ el@@ im , in which early in the morning several shots were fired into a guest house , is likely to go to the bank account of the Ban@@ de . &quot;
way lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; : a report according to the foreig@@ ner register in Germany has considerable defects in Germany . &quot;
the lead to partly serious mis@@ choices in asylum procedures .
&quot; the Federal Government Commissioner for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen , has drawn attention to a media report based on major gaps in the Aus@@ länder@@ centralized register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the there registered data could lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , &quot; warned &quot; in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , the statements are collected by ten million people with foreign citizenship , including approximately 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data will be managed according to some 600 trans@@ national agencies in Germany .
&quot; because the data have not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been well received . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who are long no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data files can be slow@@ down considerably , &quot; it says the report further . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics about pe@@ ep@@ tive people are over @-@ EU citizens , who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; but such a false acc@@ or@@ ations led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with ex@@ pedi@@ gree , &quot; it is said therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return to Italy for refugee families with under 16 @-@ old children , when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ cher Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , it means that BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children , except inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper in reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees from the EU . &quot;
&quot; if a migration travels across another EU country , this state can send him back to the Ze@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the office now write : &quot; meanwhile , the entrance capacity for families with min@@ ed children in Italy increased considerably . &quot;
Italy released for the recording and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) hold these commitments for sufficient .
other EU states would return to the US in the context of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internal political speaker at the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten the un@@ lawful absorption conditions and a haz@@ ard of cinema . &quot;
secondary results achieved
a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people was already provided for other people .
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , which were excellent on Friday . &quot;

&quot; it is awesome , how our body is laid out for this and we put on the sp@@ elling respect for their blood for foreigners , even more un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; underlined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one single blood @-@ donation helps several people , &quot; explained the circle of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preser@@ ves are distor@@ ted into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
this is how three people could benefit from a blood@@ shed .
&quot; simultaneously , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported from the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 don@@ ators the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K county conductor . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change into the theatre from a few years ago has led to higher number of participants . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ beer are awarded to the multi @-@ style don@@ ors and were awarded for each 50 completed blood sp@@ elling . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will likely be announced that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation must be sub@@ du@@ ed over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; when they hold the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.@@ 7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the household income would continue to increase by almost 3 % in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that within the next few years , they would become necessary to grow the inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit costs may need to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s Business package that was published one year after Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will request time for funding plan to provide funds for banks , even though it is expected that they will be expected 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of Sterling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision about the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the real income of households will continue to be deb@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; the interest rates repeti@@ tive it , that &quot; a certain pen@@ alties of monetary policy &quot; would be required for cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; scale than the markets are expected . &quot;
the markets predic@@ t the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected in comparison with the 1.@@ 9 % and 1.9 % compared to the growth forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0,5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent disap@@ point growth will be sub@@ du@@ ed up to a single source , and GDP increased to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to recover in the third quarter of 0.3 % , although it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent in@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households , who are affected by an increasing inflation and low price levels , as the sharpen@@ ing is first even worse before they get better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot prevent the income in the coming years &quot; , &quot; but they added that wages to the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to weak pounds , which is compensated for a part of the lower consumption . &quot;
&quot; the decision will take a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the ham of the dog . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the last judgment of the bank to the interest rates , the call was increased according to a place level , since inflation increased the pressure on hard stran@@ ded households , whereby three political decision makers in July have a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; in the last month , inflation has declined from 2,@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the bank said that this was expected and going to go back in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the crossing in relation to their destination of 2 % be &quot; quite &quot; the weak pounds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ inc@@ Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent back process of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , since the l@@ is@@ lat@@ ch market is likely to look for shops and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those who run existing De@@ als and complete the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is said to rub against HIV @-@ drug 10.000 people
patients will be received after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one prior to the sexual intercourse risk cancer ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can decrease the inf@@ ective risk cancer by about 86 percent , now by healthcare service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he said to finance the trial , after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ver@@ dict of the Supreme Court of Justice last year , that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday announced chess program was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) this is the &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to follow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October 2018 . &quot;
prevention of pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicines that are taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transfer in infectious diseases .
taking Pr@@ EP in front of intercourse means that just enough medicines are available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as early as two hours before intercourse .
&quot; those who come for treatment in question include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status cannot be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered with a doctor , can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic . &quot;
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of pharmaceutical drugs during this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by which clinical trials will be collected , added and implemented in large scale . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for preventing HIV and over@@ hau@@ led .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; when it is targeted to the need@@ y and vulnerable people , the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September on , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not with a negotiation with a partner , leading to improving many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority now needs to be accomplished quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP @-@ test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected persons . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due after monthly removal and hes@@ itation by the government . &quot;
the evidence indicate how transforming this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the end to the dissemination of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court Apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first tour , the 1,000 square meters has been completely rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; originally a one @-@ room estate with a spar@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add jo@@ anne , storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my request , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose they put the architecture and designer studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
fan had to be creative thinking to solve the default .
&quot; the steel plant is fairly complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arrange that they were over@@ shad@@ owed , without having to fill ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down . &quot;
this arrangement allowed it Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with much extra drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine looks a classic clut@@ ch window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us , about the gl@@ am@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold @-@ furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination put the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both ends a short walk is mir@@ r@@ ored to work for him longer .
in the kitchen the spi@@ der feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we have mir@@ r@@ ored units for all bri@@ st@@ les and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ less space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter@@ important , so it is when you push the door to push @-@ up , very easy . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain extra 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate mak@@ ler will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here , you have managed to enlarge the ground surface and at the same time use high quality materials that get the room to offer its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you in the electric so@@ ckets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square met@@ alli@@ s of slightly standard even in something quite different .
&quot; in fact , like yo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollars of real estate
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate imperial Vic@@ tori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets shall be split . &quot;
&quot; Paul already wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have collected 38 real estate in a value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family since 1973 bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co Je@@ ans family set up and grew to a chain of 160 retailers . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Matthew Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ ban . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her died father , Col@@ in - by Paul is described as &quot; main operator and the dominating personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s family , and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court note that this means that Col@@ in is owned by 316 million dollars and Paul in value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a direct point for Paul as issues .
&quot; those of Col@@ in proposed resolutions have left him with the left what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first monkey av@@ it . &quot;
last Friday took place after several failed to take place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
&quot; the brothers also fight for the control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , I excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in argue that this is not true , but throws Paul to manage some possessions in prof@@ ici@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early monkey av@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hope to put the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her died husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delic@@ acy to be operated in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early seven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood songs , in the Col@@ in the first je@@ ans the family opened . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began west@@ co there , when he was a small child in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their ownership to their sons . &quot;
Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brethren in court &apos; wrote them .
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , whereby Col@@ in claims that mark upon leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars were paid . &quot;
&quot; Luke as well as Mark , &quot; said Paul &quot; about the conditions of its financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has maintained itself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L director , and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts may be . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to disgu@@ ise me and drag our sur@@ name through the dishes , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not want to ask that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday the hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new rod plans to restrict the media de@@ stin@@ ence of the President .

here is a piece by Re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ ern@@ ef of the White House , at his first working day with leading employees , he presented a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he wants to fix : bad information that fall into the hands of the President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brie@@ f@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to enum@@ er@@ ate Tru@@ mp by super@@ v@@ ise its media . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if promising Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were to convince &quot; &quot; said the former electoral consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to hold Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter @-@ habit under control , according to six former election campaign , to ensure that his personal media intake includes a constant lob@@ ster . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter are ever &quot; under control &quot; , is ridic@@ ulous . &quot;
perhaps this fact @-@ agn@@ es know something we could not know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would have not included their interventions even more igni@@ tion .
we will probably never know something about the T@@ we@@ ets which has not sent Tru@@ mp .
&quot; if his staff had to hold it several times , ag@@ gra@@ vation of him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has to prevent it consistently , that Tru@@ mp sets forth . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem is that men in a White House which sets out from competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp &apos;s material , that may also promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of consultants , the president of strategic reasons for dou@@ bt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Re@@ por@@ ters Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp be@@ amer say that Tru@@ mp can react as a volcano on negative press cuts , especially such with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks , and that he finds himself to figure out where these originate . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February , when somebody gave a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ pro@@ voc@@ ate Charles C. Johnson , called the dep@@ uty rod in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , to be the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was banned from Twitter to Twitter or that he has no specific evidence , or that he vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and vo@@ ke them in the past . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; gold @-@ makers added that the then Stab@@ ern@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper , the Tru@@ mp receives . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly seeks three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ er still strive towards influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
best sought crimin@@ als get post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the aid of the people will pray and hoped . &quot;
the police across Europe have ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the requested heavy @-@ crus@@ hers are not known , evidence of the population will be hoped and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , following the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Advent@@ ures of Winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences had shown that many fle@@ ece are hiding in holiday places , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for requested crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ensi@@ tive , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online gest@@ ures could have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to execution on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate on a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; million@@ th @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some strong travellers on the war that have negotiated one of the congregation of drawn dit@@ ch to rep@@ ay a field in front of its men &apos;s homes .
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; &quot; million@@ th series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transportation , after it had been thrown out in May , without being de@@ ported by one of the Council to prevent their inci@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense systems , and expressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot;
&quot; angry inhabitants have stran@@ ded the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They are on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they were cast stones to the pas@@ sers . &quot;
the Council has to be forced by means of putting into practice since it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travelers were there in May and have been moved again .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle long shelter in order to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my community , if the Council does not even stop it . &quot;
&quot; residents who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers just to pl@@ ush by another round . &quot;
this time the numbers have increased and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a speaker at the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our data collection , it is very important that as many inhabitants get an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 to 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we will present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel is Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the hotel Birken@@ hof through the then setting of the company Birken@@ hof , which dates back to 13 April 2014 onwards , approximately 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenue by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees who arrived in the county of Land@@ scape , the hotel buildings offered to the Land@@ rat@@ chet as a collective accommodation , which took place for controversy . &quot;
the town of prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the preparation of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was at that time un@@ disp@@ uted at that time .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois , Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke already back then by serious interested parties in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with business leader Bir@@ g@@ it Sch@@ erer acquired with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern the former Hotel Birken@@ hof acquired with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ platz object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been standing for a longer period of construction containers before the entrance , and when one enters the house , it will be clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were turned out , blankets to the part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black @-@ style style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large fenced showers , the entrance area is trans@@ figured , there are new windows built . &quot;
&quot; everything sol@@ ves later &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer presses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; it does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale city level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sh@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men are to feel at home in the hotel . &quot;
conversations with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Direc@@ torate Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led to .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; almost under a million Euros , he reck@@ on . &quot;
the outdoor facilities are also brought to For@@ eg@@ mann that is already clearly visible .
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is available from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : US Special Re@@ mitt@@ ler sets the Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair concerning U.S. president Donald Tru@@ mp , he should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury with Robert Mu@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; the Panel has taken the work in the past weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to the affair of trusted persons . &quot;
the paper recognis@@ es the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has extended and intensified .
&quot; the CN@@ N station reported , there was already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. secret services en@@ qu@@ iring the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a longer time to be targeted at the presidential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were inter@@ rup@@ tions between Tru@@ mp@@ s electoral team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are standing in the election campaign as a consultant of the re@@ public@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to that , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment under the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special hand@@ ler Tru@@ mp has personally moved to the center and seek the draft , whether the President may not hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys , it is to examine and decide whether an indictment is to be collected . &quot;
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called accus@@ ations .
mostly they are switched on when it concerns larger and controversy cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched from the Prosec@@ utor to charge persons for listening in E@@ id .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N station , the dischar@@ ges were already exhibited that revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp j@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who participated in the meetings were asked to be a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tru@@ mp Co@@ r. were also Tru@@ mp@@ s advisor and in @-@ law @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ iger election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
&quot; right @-@ wing extrem@@ ly said on Thursday night in US television , that the composition show that Mu@@ eller should not shy away in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; however , the composition of the body was at the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President taken on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the issue will give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion , he knew nothing of the composition of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but these works also usually in the secret , he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House affir@@ ms any measures , which accelerated the work of the Special &quot; &quot; fair &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI boss James Com@@ ey announced three times that will not be as@@ cer@@ tained against the President .
&quot; I have no reason to suppose that something changed , it was in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; Mu@@ eller had only been used , after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had folded . &quot;
&quot; because of this ration@@ ally , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to be asked for an attitude of the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; according to the presentation of U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the special settlers and its employees . &quot;
the sol@@ dering spec@@ ulations about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release .
&quot; unlike an independent special hand@@ ler of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , became a position that later , Mu@@ eller has a position in which it theoretically could be folded to the president of the President of the Court of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bow such a step yet .
&quot; two groups of re@@ publi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators stood on Thursday , after which the special chan@@ cell@@ or could no longer be dismis@@ sed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the Western Ant@@ arctic has solved a gigantic Eis@@ berg from the barely si@@ eben@@ fold size of Berlin by the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Oce@@ anic Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the length of a B@@ illion tonnes heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , big Kol@@ oss is now coming to the north and will probably need two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it has been with 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice cream , which researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people does not go out from him .
in what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ice is unclear .
&quot; however , there has been a series of uncommon inter@@ rup@@ tions of Eis@@ sch@@ el@@ fen in the region since about 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can interact with the warming . &quot;
the broken col@@ oss was so far a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by great gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it is constantly growing into the sea and regularly breaks down .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fi@@ is is located south of South America almost at the head of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula .
&quot; north of this heart , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions were disturbed before a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; a full Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i is there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about it , that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front se@@ pul@@ ses have never been so far withdrawn as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate stand under tension and could fall , if there is a piece in a key place . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the se@@ al@@ level , as it is pushed down on the water and pushed into the ice as much water as it appears after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the case leads to the glacier directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in low dimensions , writes the British research project on the observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is named after AW@@ I @-@ statements with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the four @-@ biggest sh@@ el@@ ist of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and is not conscious of a direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ shield comes now into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the biggest withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; confirmed too . &quot;
&quot; under scientists be controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i will now be back and possibly collap@@ sed , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though these researchers have failed to withdraw the break@@ up of this gigantic ic@@ eberg not on climate change , so in the past decades there are many ice @-@ shi@@ el@@ ves of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula . &quot;
this long run of the Ant@@ arctic extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Ant@@ arctic Survey the ice @-@ surface of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers .
the drop in temperature has contributed .
the Ant@@ arctic peninsula in the past 50 years have war@@ med around three degrees and cus@@ pi@@ le to the areas where temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants to be Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming more difficult to occupy itself freely , calls the CD@@ U , out of the employer association to be more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the K@@ rei@@ ving was 41 new places in the administration .
&quot; more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the administration in M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
now once again 17 trainees have their first working day after themselves .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very popular .
some 620 applications have been in vain for the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to be able to cope with the increasing demands and tasks . &quot;
currently there are no positions at the circle M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and to establish the skilled angel in the administration .
&quot; according to the request of the parties &quot; &quot; the administration is to develop a concept for human resources and human resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term need for specialists , but future @-@ oriented of the application shortage , is said . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an educational offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
&quot; for the circle has to do with personal problems , which you did not know earlier . &quot;
other towns advertise good officials and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is given by a regular &quot; contest of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age may be contracted out of the service . &quot;
so the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; however , Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , frac@@ tion@@ e@@ ef of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common request . &quot;
&quot; he discovered long ago in the day @-@ day for a worth@@ less surprise when he put the staff cost openly in question , and the remaining parties aston@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; people want to be reviewed that all possibilities will be checked , which allow an exit from the municipal employer association . &quot;
&quot; if we come here not at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the administration with the trade unions - maybe also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - have a bon@@ st@@ ari@@ f . &quot;
&quot; in order to pay better the CD@@ U , the employees and officials to pay better than it is actually fores@@ ee@@ able for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money there is only if you change to a higher level that is oriented to professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new spaces had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
&quot; last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ tor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to NGO @-@ migrants
&quot; Italy has NGOs to use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue this , if they do not keep on new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not under@@ write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner newspaper La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ niti@@ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team worked effectively with men &apos;s hands in a way that ligh@@ tened the illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year since a year to complete the alleg@@ ations of the Italian nationality , Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ o@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . so , we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue operations , &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can evaluate all accus@@ ations , which are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ rie@@ &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , supervised since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his crew bu@@ ck@@ ship migrants are delivered on board , which can be delivered to them directly by men &apos;s hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can cycle down , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting , supposedly , only 1,@@ 3 miles in front of the Libyan coast took place , according to the acc@@ laimed of the prosec@@ utor , whose content of Italian media was published . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected to im@@ itate the authority of the Italian coastal defence , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have a Italian police officers on board , who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and lif@@ ebo@@ ats , have previously prepared to keep up the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday , that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable as they would be no &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; to their b@@ ail@@ out transactions . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Minn@@ iti said , meanwhile , that the number of migrants arrived at the end of the rescue operations in Italy during the last weeks , that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and the cooperation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month over economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
An@@ sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ ers Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ au in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz , in order to enjoy four days of tri@@ ggers and attractions . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
Burgundy W@@ einf@@ est of wax was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed view@@ points , partly on towers where you could look far beyond the Palat@@ ine forest and the up@@ stream layers . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always extended asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ bun@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim for Sal@@ ine and for the People &apos;s Festival .
&quot; again , viewpoint at the viewpoint , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days many elev@@ ators were told again .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and her@@ edi@@ ts brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ met@@ en the bi@@ ker in the open @-@ san@@ atorium Sole .
also new city has been controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 metres , the group had the Pf@@ alz forest from its best side - sporty and cultur@@ ally - met . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga retro@@ fit for e @-@ sport
&quot; are the Sport @-@ Stars primarily sitting before computer consoles , rather than to fight against wind and weather to fight over the stadium ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ Sport has long become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - large stars , million fans and huge tournaments with high passages . &quot;
this also recognised the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 of V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in the middle of July an e @-@ sport department and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire the whole new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board Jo@@ chen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; that on this turn , several clubs are rising . &quot;
&quot; on the coming weekend , the football World association will organise the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; at which the gam@@ er of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ olds , that young people even go into the stadium in the future , says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract , one could be much more frequently present on these markets than once a year to send the federal union to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; at e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football @-@ simulation FIFA on competitive level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in the normal sport also , Li@@ gen established , in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the Asian , E @-@ Sports is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many is the performance to be ordinary .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has a long way to deal with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German spor@@ tive School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competitive and a lot of biological and physical responses to be found in classical sport - for example increased heart frequencies , stress levels , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there will be cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a rapid response . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only train at the console but also to train their body and watch diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; F@@ rob@@ ous also sees problems : &quot; &quot; doping is getting more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to play in online games , and in the scene mis@@ ses the structures of classic sport . &quot;
the scientists highlights the high inclusive effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are internationally on the way , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural shirts . &quot;
a study conducted by Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Enter@@ tain@@ ments ( BI@@ U ) tells E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot;
in three years the turnover of 130 million are expected .
against the nearly 2.@@ 4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga are little .
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will take part in the U.S. Team N@@ R@@ G sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe does a lot .
&quot; in a Norwegian school had been introduced e @-@ sport as a lesson , &quot; says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga are obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to fall in nostal@@ gia , and the old times is not enough today , is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but the company simultaneously focus on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; says also Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; you cannot stick to it , that only at football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter , because of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy pushing for su@@ icide , &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to local currency . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sentenced to life in June due to neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings of Con@@ rad Roy , which took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the father of Roy , on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ted . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to stay free until calling .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red p@@ ants and a cream @-@ colored Bl@@ use , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down towards aligned eyes than it was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor of the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility for her , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said , it is a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they totally regret . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity is a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I pray not the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pains that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters there is in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys Si@@ ster sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will never be prosec@@ uted by the realization &quot; &quot; I will never be part in the wedding of her brother or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; not anymore to have this single person , with which I was together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to call others to commit self @-@ murder . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in 2014 by a coal oxid@@ ation poison@@ ing in a vehicle .
&quot; the case attracted national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters the following noti@@ fications revealed that she had encouraged him to finish his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging you down , springs from a building , ste@@ eping yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she was in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All that you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy , and or@@ da@@ ined that she would benefit by any press by the case . &quot;
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few , the Carter defended , belongs to Amanda Kno@@ x , which was condemned in 2007 because of Mor@@ ning on their British room@@ mate in Italy before it was acqu@@ itted for two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ im@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua K@@ im@@ me was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as captain , is no coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner has won a great season - extra motivation is not there .
&quot; what was different at his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ im@@ me immediately , even though the extra gar@@ ment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , not a Philipp Lah@@ m and also not a Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself shared Bin@@ de at the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first deployment as Bayern @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the one could have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the mark from the Coach could also interpret so .
&quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen for youth playing , de@@ bark@@ ants and just out of the vacation professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader , but he . &quot;
&quot; they are distributed to those who love to do a lot , which one wants to keep in mood . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen , the heritage of Lah@@ m can be found , a small extra motivation can only be used well . &quot;
&quot; K@@ im@@ me confirmed , &quot; This is what one wants to do as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday flow@@ ed the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
&quot; right behind , this is now his position , the white bin@@ ds at the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ im@@ me in this start @-@ formation like the one who can take the rest of the best in the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had the view to the whole while many others were engaged themselves .
&quot; Vid@@ al therefore to over@@ play his missing fitness ( til@@ ted scar@@ c@@ ely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore , on devil come out to the achievements of the Asia @-@ journey ( til@@ ted ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as sweet@@ ness thereby , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ jer@@ sey are not neg@@ atively affected . &quot;
that after all it was very good .
&quot; in addition to K@@ im@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm did often heavy , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to be successful in the game construction a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy gave us that the result &quot; was not that way , as we have hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; shift , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual , these Bavaria @-@ world still is for the most accessible , one saw following the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
K@@ im@@ me passed away after a few fl@@ esh@@ y statements in the back of his new players .
&quot; there he heard a interesting phrase there : &quot; &quot; what goes here , I already noticed now . &quot;
&quot; with Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new . &quot;
Al@@ aba is motivated Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
&quot; in Austria , the foot of Austria announced shortly before the game about Twitter and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ et@@ land @-@ bo@@ unc@@ le Minister : economy lo@@ dges Wis@@ dom Tempo
&quot; it has often been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as the E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , was still economic development in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is more than a year , in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ Question of a change in economic policy - and impeccable at the same time the old prime minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ ers Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing inv@@ ades the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest ven@@ tiveness sees Nat@@ us in the infra@@ structural policy : the trail of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the Pri@@ or@@ ity@@ list of the country at the top of the country .
&quot; this year , the Ministry for a planetary procedure , until 2005 the building is to be right . &quot;
a role in the plans of the country also plays the west wing Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal plan . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the course in December 2020 in operation , says Mini@@ stries of Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ CI ) Trier aims to increase the sales in supermarkets , while the wine is a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Wis@@ dom have an open ear for people who want to start a own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier sees in the new Master @-@ bonus an additional incentive for young appren@@ tices , says CEO Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; provided is a premium rate of 1000 Euro for the master exam and 2500 euros , if graduates have been self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; during the planned street building be quick facts to create , at the same time out of the country at the necessary staff , Jan Bell &apos;s , chief business leaders of the Chamber of Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing wants to set the Wis@@ sing on the mobility of mobility , are currently under 29 places so far . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to external offices .

Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the skilled angel in the region .
ern@@ ü@@ ch@@ tern@@ d may also be the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional enterprises had reviewed the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note . &quot;

Audi is to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face with a bac@@ kl@@ ash .
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ ,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW leader said , the company is the opinion that &quot; there is smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , and related to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to offer or restrict . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daim@@ ler announced that there will be three million Mercedes cars to modify in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies describe the enterprises as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support observance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; to install the cost of automobile manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of the Ab@@ el@@ ites to install , take also what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also being indic@@ ted to understand the powerful drivers and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ called sk@@ il@@ alt devices , which could regulate emissions when a car was tested , but when a car was tested . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected against delivery and could be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen , after the authorities have installed Audi to have a system installed , and a request that focused on the United States , has been expanded . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi to the investigation could be Volkswagen difficult to charge , the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the g@@ rief
&quot; Mor@@ dill@@ o was temporarily one of the most widely published carto@@ onists , the mon@@ ies of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian of the Argent@@ inian nor is working in a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as an artist for lucky cards - which was frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded at the end of the 60@@ s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris match &quot; and then also in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dill@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artists of cities inspire .
&quot; big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dill@@ o @-@ figures cav@@ or@@ ting in drawings with the s@@ late tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; according to the early morning , he is still sitting on the character of the morning , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; via calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ shirts and watches are continuing to find a lot of spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV show with his characters . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ es animal in its drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ end@@ om @-@ player as a counter@@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , the 2019 will come to the chin wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ dill@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , it is more likely to rely on the TV series , which is produced like its original names . &quot;
la@@ vender from Provence is threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ vender is rec@@ alled because of the lack of dro@@ ught conditions and due to the diseases transmitted insects , what scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the agr@@ arian Institute of CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ vender in Provence is effective , because the plant had been exposed to climate change in the past few years that has brought much less rain in spring and fall much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of la@@ vender .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium transm@@ its , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
la@@ vender oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very sought for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ ENT@@ W@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have fewer parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered , a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the soil , but also the pr@@ on@@ est of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties , which are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employee of the Weekly Rio@@ do@@ ce meet , normally , meet their plans for the reporting of recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ceas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
&quot; it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the re@@ por@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal . &quot;
&quot; there are drug regul@@ ators , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no silence of violence , and throughout the country the corp@@ ses were frequent , and more journalists have joined : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 stand after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year . &quot;
among the latter you will find editors and their inspir@@ ator from Rio@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack will be deep informed , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its mid finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; hanging on the façade of the Rio@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the three @-@ thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ barra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry on his smiling face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porter discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their alp@@ eng@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 has been established a Son@@ der @-@ Federal Office to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only introduced two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , who are connected with drug @-@ trading and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will only be rare in court . &quot;
&quot; at Rio@@ do@@ ce they still insist on the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are un@@ tr@@ unc@@ ated , and although the terrain is still in stock . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security , says I@@ barra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid , my time in this workshop is wast@@ ing &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know why , we mi@@ tig@@ ate all . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Rio@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; he managed to drive just a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presum@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ der River &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius continued in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in c@@ uli@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the subject Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as ri@@ val groups struggle to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people will be shot on the street , or that the cemetery is full of fin@@ ely two @-@ story mou@@ een for drug addic@@ ts that are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Rio@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of a interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val carto@@ ons in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may be anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country with his own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its kill@@ ings is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were saying that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este as he joined together with five colleagues on the founding of Rio@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to run journalism without having to come across the ru@@ d@@ ote problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time , the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting , and the turnover and advertising took place . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ters loved it , hard to publish harsh investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories , which nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
eight years after the founding of Rio@@ do@@ ce received it the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever she ran . &quot;
he gave himself volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that falls you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I would not want to be asked , &quot; What have you done about so many T@@ oters ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
&quot; the Rio@@ do@@ ce team is missing Val@@ dez , the spa @-@ bird , who was like a port worker , the friend who knew generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher , who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted on his routine .
he would always bear his guard .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ama , the bar towards the office , go and sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; well , ask : was his love to be routine ? &quot;
&quot; his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on question , how to do their work best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home start@@ up and cross @-@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
to trust his own instinc@@ t .
&quot; if it smells , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of Rio@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell can become a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier is happening . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Z@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where an toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government offices are at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Rio@@ do@@ ce met for security training , were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days previously was known that Spy@@ ware issued exclusively to governments , to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside two polic@@ emen were seeking protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were asked by the provincial government to protect the offices of Rio@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story house in a mid @-@ class district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asking if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers , which the governor itself is as un@@ trusted . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drugs standing de facto under control . &quot;
for the edition of this week Rio@@ do@@ ce left on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother &apos;s brother Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state of state that focused on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office , carried out a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who has been kidn@@ apped , or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write , what everybody in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally produced by drug retailers and authorities . &quot;
a re@@ porter was made from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy that the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) belongs almost the whole century all political levels .
recently several Pr@@ i @-@ Govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the re@@ porter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this local e@@ at@@ ery , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man came to a military attack . &quot;
&quot; a few months before , the readers would have seen the Colom@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; previously we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been a storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , which are dedicated against the kill@@ ings of journalists who have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ por@@ e@@ pers Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped up a few signs and passed the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing , that it is his . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country journalists have become stronger , by acting in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on wal@@ kers and buildings . &quot;
this day the director of Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
&quot; during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez was accused of authorities , journalists lo@@ osing and bring them to them , because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has been asked since then to be divided by the government , because they are concerned that their anger has in@@ jured their objectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , involved in government officials and a similar society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co journal , &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drug policies , but also on the command of politicians and security forces , with organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; group was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the last year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico @-@ minded you think , because they want you dis@@ keep the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have an ab@@ rupt effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found together with a note that allegedly was signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer @-@ buttons and ear@@ phones in addition to their separate head .
some stores will be elected as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua following the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as there was El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of her Director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly set up the drug box with an article on the front page with the head@@ line &quot; What do you want from us ?
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they will be hun@@ ted , as it was apparently murdered by the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain returning and continuing work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ barra , who once wanted to be poet , gives me that the drug trading is frigh@@ tened him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I became Re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last edition was already terminated , the editors of Rio@@ do@@ ce on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer than once all their phones began to be sum@@ mon@@ ed . &quot;
a number of sho@@ wer@@ ies with band@@ aging and security guards near the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed t@@ ote .
the war escal@@ ated on how it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the log@@ istic edge they have published the news on the website of Rio@@ do@@ ce via mobile phones .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ enen he@@ ul@@ ed nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers to see the guards to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid of all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose mid@@ finger was visible for all Z@@ alo@@ a , followed the employees of Rio@@ do@@ ce its marks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said on the same day when Javier was murdered , the practic@@ ant me asking me to send them to the street . &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ften its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue as well as a start@@ ling .
&quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the unbelievable Nas@@ horn of a Canadian Berg@@ worker have been so well received , that experts are described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his love @-@ old skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said , they had something of a &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; marked him as &quot; the bes@@ ter@@ ies @-@ ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs , who has ever been found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs pieces of the world . &quot;
&quot; fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the K@@ rei@@ de@@ em between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well preserved state has researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic is the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ vor@@ es that best preser@@ ves its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn F@@ unk , when he was in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something , which seemed from the surrounding rocks at the board , and decided to look more accurately . &quot;
that discovered by him fossil was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you want to blin@@ king just a little with eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept &quot; , &quot; said the captain Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant @-@ vor@@ es , even though he is covered with armor and a changing tank , probably by meat and sent dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technology that is known as a bac@@ kl@@ ist , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix themselves better in its surroundings and to so@@ ften his enemies , say experts , what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has taken place in May for the first time and is now to be seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called es Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ers according to the museum technology Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of scales and armor about his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ aded , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it points out that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by enough pressure by meat and sent dinosau@@ rs , that evolution was fav@@ oured by the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ aded - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or gon@@ dol@@ as - are much smaller and vulnerable as boot@@ y , which sign@@ aled that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ed behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ r show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es have been to have been , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was brown .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life , including his conc@@ ert@@ hal@@ ted to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , driven into a river , and dri@@ fted into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Alberta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because he is fully covered with consistent skin , but also in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly as in the early K@@ rei@@ de@@ zeit .
&quot; you do not need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ rei@@ de@@ em was a time , as a huge spa , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ r that stood on two legs , the earth went through . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terrible ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1.5 m ) long , six tonnes of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Portal , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was broad@@ cast@@ ed after death in the sea and is classified in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn F@@ unk , when he was near to Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the supp@@ er ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ r of the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
the creatures were weigh@@ ed on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 inch long tips from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed crop @-@ vor@@ es were stir@@ red by the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater pun@@ ish of the dinosau@@ rs saves his arm@@ our in an exquisite detail .
&quot; the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this specific specimen are so well preserved , that the remains still b@@ ump@@ y pl@@ ains along the dinosau@@ rs &quot;
how Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko was written for National Geo@@ graphic is such a level of conservation as &apos; rare as a gain in the lot@@ to .
&quot; the more I call it , the more confusing it will . &quot;
&quot; hidden remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right front is on his side , his five fingers crossed the top . &quot;
I can count the sheds at his sole .
in th@@ under@@ storm : mass@@ ac@@ aram@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
fierce accident on Thursday night at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass am@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilometres long hours and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on Thursday Thursday morning at a mass am@@ am@@ bol@@ age , about 20 people have been wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the first data of the police were against 17.00 hours between the connectors Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storm almost 30 cars , including probably trucks , inter@@ tw@@ ined . &quot;
about the exact number of the off@@ ences did not take any information at first .
it is light to moderate injuries said a polic@@ eman .
a great advent of lif@@ ebo@@ ats was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in direction to Munich .
in the direction of Munich there was about ten kilometres long re@@ pri@@ stine .
&quot; like an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it came also on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire bri@@ des have seen the marks of the vehicle wheel that now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 and then there was a second accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it was a collision between an auto@@ cr@@ ran@@ spor@@ ter and a car . &quot;
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everybody has experienced once : nothing else is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes from Schaff@@ ner and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ an@@ ft or irrit@@ ates the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
chassis control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn can currently check the un@@ condi@@ tionally chassis card control .
you just confirm the phone that you have taken up your seat and then evalu@@ ates the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes to , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available at many other long distances in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said an train speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in , &quot; is called the rail card de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you must also have purchased it via the App of the railway , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket reservation . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works so : one climb@@ s to the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the test results will then be a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the Zug@@ leaders get a message on their mobile devices that the passenger X is located on the train and taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; comes the train manager at the card control at place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so one can continue to sleep , continue to mention . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who relaxed without ticket control would like to travel through our Zug@@ companion , chec@@ kl@@ kt in the DB Navigator is just yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables the passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management of DB remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today , to respond to the individual needs of the needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives , knows that in addition to delays and pass@@ able , the chassis controls are among the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for many times , one does not have all the documents that you need for the utilisation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or credit card will be missing or otherwise a document , which you need to indicate . &quot;
&quot; the consequence are endless discussions between Zug@@ leaders and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the de@@ part or large @-@ room and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time takes care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and even on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart food .
further train numbers on the same track are still un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Brittany Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken to their core .
&quot; just one day after they arrived in New York City , sat in St. Louis in the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
they stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street . &quot;
&quot; confused because nobody else had posted on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was continually wor@@ shipped at its tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live . &quot;
he post@@ ete a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ aning body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; figured Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her cell phone later in order to go back to T@@ we@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field drive .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and the people who cried , and by a man who commanded , browsing father , who carried a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ ished dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , un@@ insured a different polic@@ eman is his ri@@ f@@ le and crying : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; remembered Fer@@ rel@@ l to their statement . &quot;
that is not the kind of murder we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and crying . &quot;
you booked a return trip and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on in the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , the strength and the resistance , which consists of the perspective of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter who carried a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , according to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; remember , what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not correct . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them with , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot;
what happens today is a climax of what happened in the past .
it needs to know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience ec@@ cl@@ ant racism , it is not different from the next black women @-@ child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , located at the South Fl@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp @-@ area , as the activists on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there was Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter connected with a local business owner , the lunch made . &quot;
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ves they pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new type of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August totally changed , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food fairness and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met for an evening @-@ demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to just &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question occurred Fer@@ rel@@ l in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; these skep@@ ticism has been nourished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community who benef@@ ited from her pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , which is known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; his dedication brought Fer@@ rel@@ l the project closer , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns Er@@ shoot . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , as I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but about a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - they proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show &quot; &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life , how she fell in love with her and married her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the worship of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is history repeated the role of black sw@@ ow@@ ls women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as pregnant . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry out the main load of all . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an unanim@@ ously to notice that &quot; the movement is really kept up by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it exists that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in Fer@@ rel@@ l , due to their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the front front , because with a life at these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the communication enk@@ am@@ eras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long gone , but the racial ties between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on local currency for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ tion of a highway during a demonstration .
&quot; she describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area , which they call their home : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ oned to a song and she feels committed to this memory , since she went over three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

&quot; saying one to the bit @-@ Galerie : &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; This would be genuine &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; needs no man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ise ) or quite simple : &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , of which the remaining shops are benef@@ iting , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian zone ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farm market hall is available in the 13 direct market @-@ market . &quot;
with the beginning of construction work will be the end .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to the Bed@@ a place with possibility of sitting outside sitting .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost every week in the farm market hall for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm are always happy to be very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we discovered for us .
we would like that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there are other cities in other cities .
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether direct market presence in a market hall in the gallery , arrives at the height of the rent . &quot;
&quot; however , it might not be too low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s shopping cart in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ ums or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; of this , there is already enough in our city . &quot;
one sees how many charges are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; however , since it is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least get the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered are fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is above all inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop transactions are reserved in a shopping centre only by major companies , because they are often not portable for a retail@@ er often . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special transactions there are almost no more and what still exists , then will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit for Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farm market hall during the period of construction ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery will actually come .
or does it create the spec@@ tro@@ st bit gallery previously to distribute all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , also nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peasant market hall it will give it thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ singing many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg has no place anymore .
&quot; when the peasant market hall was broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ compar@@ ably same - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ ppers and Haar@@ le which were sent by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former Secret service analy@@ st took a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after they made public news on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ ur@@ resem@@ b@@ ur ( an appropriate similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was unified in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ wife and pioneering discourse that had been converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which could be extracted from M@@ anning , as anyone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data might look , a sharp if any intellectual comment may not only be made to the for@@ mb@@ osis of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ism determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since its pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 2013 because of 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the Spi@@ on@@ age@@ Act , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; by the prison its picture was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only one single photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which M@@ anning clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ blonde per@@ ishing has been associated with which it was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of its 2012 @-@ project &apos; stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette lighter and chew@@ ing g@@ um by throwing the DNA from the drop to produce an image of how these people could look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they brought an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and their det@@ ain@@ ted mines were un@@ equal to an un@@ equal spectacle , which were inter@@ changeable over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; she even illustrates one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; who would fores@@ ee a future in which the President Chel@@ icing ver@@ dict would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; in fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , cre@@ denti@@ als would call for seven brutal years in a military coup in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happ@@ ier meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little deeper and tri@@ bal , since Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against inform@@ ants from the government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et paths that it should actually remedy , continue to de@@ fl@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery &apos;s written artistic statement called M@@ anning with its superior signature among them ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their sur@@ name is equipped with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis has been the basis of gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and GS , and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; hoped , hoped by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; it shows m@@ anning , as they appear with a hands @-@ pre@@ ef@@ on in the hand from the secretary of the United States as King @-@ Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they set up your speech , then they won . &quot;
&quot; so we never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ek , when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition even personally - as it was predicted in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room from the masks , composed by their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ulations , which collap@@ sed as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also target @-@ oriented , as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , in which her genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowds &quot; , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed with Chelsea , as the movement , which also hidden behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and a cler@@ k of the University of Oxford because of killing
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff at the University of Oxford , who were looking for being susp@@ ects as susp@@ ects , after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injury . &quot;
&quot; on Monday were exhibited for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ted because of murder because of their alleged participation in Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Chief of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents said that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several styles died . &quot;
one from the police authority of Chicago published non @-@ community war@@ nings that the corp@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries at his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the place of the action , and determin@@ ants examine the stal@@ k as murder , while the police actively seeks the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ a has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ dies now be out of a judge and exp@@ elled from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal issue that is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University cooperates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ i . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK in contact and ready to help the U.S. Inves@@ tigation authorities every conceivable way .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and wanting it to be .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he calls the susp@@ ects strong to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have a presentation of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building managed of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , which had just received a mysterious tip that had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 something . &quot;
the police describe the scene as a very cruel one .
&quot; she said , it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that ladies and War@@ ren in the building were .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team from Grand Plaza released a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline , and the background of the offering and expl@@ ores a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada @-@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian Vice ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , I will not take long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ Doping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ Doping Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfillment of the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Doping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada to comply with the code which describes the criteria for re@@ installation of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything for Russia to concern concern . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list named criteria is clear that the Russian anti @-@ intelligence authorities approved the reported results of by the W@@ ada @-@ approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer of Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly endor@@ sed D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we run the investigation as our anti @-@ doping system collap@@ sed a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ Doping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ doping organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the doping sc@@ andal from the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ checks in Russia .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Doping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main artist of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General S@@ ada @-@ General S@@ ada @-@ Director , Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA moves &quot; into the right direction &quot; to be re @-@ deployed . &quot;
Al@@ di not sold any eggs more
they shared the company groups .
&quot; it is a pure anticip@@ ation , it could further be assumed by no health draw@@ backs , it was in the communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been tested negative on fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ lungs . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency with its customers .
&quot; start@@ ups that will help your company will not become the next one , not to the next one . &quot;
Amy Deli@@ ver wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but not working with the p@@ olls .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you said anonym@@ ity , some workers don &apos;t know the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; says Deli@@ vered , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Reed . &quot;
she called people from outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to address surveys , specific groups and demo@@ graphic groups to help employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases Whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to deal with C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the pursuit of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools is used to measure staff engagement . &quot;
salvation said that she got a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap P@@ olls and Surv@@ eys of specific teams , it provides a He@@ at map of the company , which shows most complaints and which managers have low delivery results - so that you can drill through , why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next one , who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale , since then a former employee has published a blog post , which has spoken an environment of har@@ ass@@ ings , in which those who have spoken , have been pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start@@ ups as G@@ lin@@ t is this desire for an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibilities .
&quot; the Global Governance , regulation and compliance sector could own more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber F@@ allen in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convertible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent company lets you send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , confidential answers in real time and see the heat cards of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with the employee can report a bad behaviour . &quot;
&quot; and if the main mission is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured Reg@@ ulators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his employee is treated poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences due to consumer boy@@ cott , worker fluctu@@ ation and coll@@ ages , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , convertible for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate central . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company central to submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good opportunity to track the complaints from staff . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company supports Conver@@ cent , problems , the previously mentioned by executives , which were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or incomplete intern@@ ships are identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view in the experience with employment &quot; , &quot; said Vit@@ rano which direc@@ ts the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment , legal disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and staff engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; &quot; that companies knew that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and loads the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors , which have supported both start@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised the total capital of $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; smooth , $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , showing that today &apos;s employees expect more of their jobs than before . &quot;
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bet@@ s .
the staff want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are glad to be in a company , feel their voices and that the work you do , then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which are used both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors can reach Ren@@ di@@ ten if their portfolio companies are well running . companies are running well when employees are working and engaged .
&quot; to increase the analytics tools of third parties , commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data about the staff engagement in accordance with the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data is useless if the administration of an enterprise does not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it can have an expectation that changes on the path is . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this can be dis@@ appointments and oti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations &quot; , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who have seen themselves too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not following staff , &quot; Hab@@ t ye really heard me ? &quot;
do you take care of it ?
&quot; and if you do not care about why should I do ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Reed , who performs monthly staff surveys now , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so deliver@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , she was re@@ united by the quick@@ ness of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and add communications training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better relationship of workers in a branch known for high re@@ sets . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose also customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose enterprises . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it dates back to 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A com@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercises of the team on campus .
&quot; some have moved out their tri@@ c@@ oto@@ parts , and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the workout . &quot;
for a good portion of the team this un@@ active minutes represent a mid@@ day break .
players who are written to the summer kur@@ t are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final test before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man football center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday was made . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the load of the players and she has indeed extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 , in order to meet the already packed time plans of the player . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than one day , at which the br@@ aces started almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six play@@ times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they should hold out over the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal play preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a further point to the players &apos; routes . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply put it through , they plac@@ ks up , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , as soon as the camp is finished , what was rejected in view of the clear view of its fields from an adjoining parking place and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which is already covered with pedest@@ al costs , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem , once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room and then set up there for a exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video sheet of an exercise , it is a fairly good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not making too big concerns for me .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential items with counterf@@ eit messages to third parties and show their results under the original contribution then , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible fal@@ con and to show them to Fak@@ ten@@ sur@@ fers that may display outcomes of the fact@@ ress from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critici@@ zed as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of which believe they also have the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , whereby French voters were floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan according to social media networks , if they do not manage to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted post @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories are challenged by the Fak@@ ten@@ or third parties , the people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ ger for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; Connection &quot; &quot; article and work on other changes to his messages , to decrease false news . &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a gor@@ g@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ 1980 .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced a turbulent history of its cozy seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript by someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says sore . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Stories Stories , &quot; a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he was unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thum@@ b of a letter on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ car in the 1700 @-@ century , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his durability ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smells of smoke , because at that time there is a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as it would also be . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who be@@ aten with old papers is that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I have been a little over four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest , &quot; ) this seems to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to watch the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed hypo@@ heads of the walls and the bottles , the centuries spent in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ lords , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked with the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access until 2006 as the last I am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years &quot; in which Arist@@ ok@@ es said , &quot; Oh , wir@@ t it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; Ta@@ ses@@ cher , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , maps , who possessed what would be : &quot; &quot; you might think that country conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let go all his gang ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to connect to the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in 13@@ 80 at the castle , in this book with the title &quot; Kni@@ gh@@ tly , of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are connected together ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &quot; The Pri@@ est , &quot; told the history of Jes@@ uit &apos;s history , which the family Dar@@ rel@@ l is hidden for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , presented in the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century , who filled his own f@@ uneral ( a discovery , which was made only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen are faithful to his , getting back debt and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men washed their debt crises , by doing rich old women - I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise vom@@ it . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ äm@@ f@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ at@@ orio dating back to the early 20th century , which has been demanded by nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with dam@@ n life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
&quot; with the sle@@ eves of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef on Friday has started its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
still up to Thursday Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team at Nelson Ar@@ tz hold the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it is intended to give a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the promotion since yesterday on the posters at the rh@@ et@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday in@@ activated website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that some more is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we are well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in the action there is more than just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is said . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a res@@ isti@@ ble promise , one that gives the city a distinctive feature . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ fifth amount is the city of Bad Honnef and its new roof brand and the campaign will cost .
military forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
&quot; every year in the beginning of August , advis@@ es in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ sion@@ ing and transport in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so that this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
&quot; but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces , a year after the coup . &quot;
&quot; the session took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in the discussions under the presidency of the Government , the five vice @-@ president and the Minister of Defence , Home affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs too . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the over@@ s . &quot;
the government draws the breeding in the military .
&quot; general manager of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces , and the Navy have been rep@@ lic@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; since the scre@@ ened Cou@@ p , President Erdo@@ gan has found 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the move of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdo@@ gan as wire pulling of the coup . &quot;
&quot; for 4@@ 86 people who have been involved directly to the coup trial , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the put@@ sch Erdo@@ gan was called &quot; &quot; Wor@@ ship &quot; , &quot; because he calls him the opportunity to clean the armed forces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan does the army really grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet released an article entitled &quot; Un@@ eas@@ iness in the military @-@ head@@ quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the general terms , there were concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manifested themselves among other things in the abolition of the head of the dep@@ ra@@ bot@@ s for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the large @-@ pur@@ se at the army and security forces goes on any way .
&quot; in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan by decre@@ e had another 73@@ 95 government agencies , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
thereby it seemed like Erdo@@ gan &apos;s armed forces .
the gener@@ als formerly known as the actual masters of the country .
three times put@@ ted them under appeal to their role as gu@@ ardians of the world order .
&quot; after his election in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan urged the power of the military step by step , not least of appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan implants targeted Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; warned a particularly non @-@ advertis@@ ed officer who sought after the coup attempt from fear of persecution in foreign asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not let Nato . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the inf@@ ants of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration schedule to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees the legal immigrants in 50,000 per year to lower , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit , and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill was to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by the US to change the way the citizens from other countries of Green cards are issued . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come forward to the candidates who have financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to elev@@ ate route for racing
&quot; over the past months , over the future of the race GDP had been initiated - now it should go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , at the m@@ aro@@ den track , on which the tourist track drives , built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing plane in the long term , according to data from the Federal Ministry of Finance , this year is to begin on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and re @-@ establish the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ es , the country is especially important for tourism , &quot; &quot; declared road secretary Klaus Sü@@ hl on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the repairs carried out on a distance of about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the land is 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the treaty , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , I am currently finally coordinated , explained Sü@@ hl . &quot;
the ministry and the southern train as operator were already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; this means the roadmap to be tra@@ ded on the vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; said Sü@@ hl . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so that the race Shuttle on December 2017 can be ordered regular .
the racing Shuttle is a popular train connection between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ es .
&quot; over the past few months , in the course of a pilot company , it has been tested , whether the track is used by sufficient many people to order it in the future . &quot;
the route is also very strong in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought , that it can not be more crazy , a new report comes across the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot@@ ic in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , em@@ eri@@ zed professor for robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fingers . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them still much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ o have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions to be achieved through the artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , and choose everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is even more disturbing , since many robots have the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; , &quot; which would seem to be a step@@ pe woman . &quot;
modern senses have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt its robots to the properties that they are appealing to such as student . &quot;
&quot; and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of rel@@ ent@@ arity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of True Comp@@ ani@@ on . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she don &apos;t like what you do not like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , fixed on con@@ ges@@ tion or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the under@@ scores of female properties , the an@@ a@@ vers on rape , if one enters a step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is said here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah is un@@ quiet one most . &quot;
on his website True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , this sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex@@ bac@@ on . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark@@ er and deeper into our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subj@@ ection to an optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course keep no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R notices their rising popularity , they still remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what we@@ ather@@ ed out of the boundary zones , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange , or hur@@ ry to give them the free market there . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain reason@@ ing that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there has been a president in the White House who has been bl@@ amed to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ rupt aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tales &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the sle@@ ep@@ tive body and the out@@ och@@ enen eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want to feel humane that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot;
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
&quot; they have no placement or background @-@ story , nothing , what is hin@@ dered to independence or anything that could inter@@ fere with the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
differently expressed : you are fake slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Rom@@ ney about the term of a healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a t@@ sen@@ ess of the Tru@@ mp era that has pol@@ arized the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate , even families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest gave it in the USA newspapers with advice on how to handle with the horror of Tru@@ mp relative .
we are all supposed to put all of us to put down our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ ine , a lef@@ tist @-@ oriented poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been visiting with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family who has visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House is everyone who knows her , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , having fought for centuries because of politics , suddenly and very peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this also involves significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the pro@@ vement of his presidency has the power to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ assy possibility that our kittens will no longer be cancel@@ ed to us . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a hard @-@ time scenario in the Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as a term of neg@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact occur as a very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only must be mental to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my cous@@ in in the city , we brought our children to car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ el of the New York park department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are k@@ ic@@ rig and the animals are twi@@ sting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music convey@@ s this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many stereotyp@@ es of a city disap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; but Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ years , and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have been able to evaluate the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked him . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate this week in a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before leaving my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to sell the rating with a 15 % grat@@ uity in order to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ ing of what actually a neutral exchange should be , but also takes pressure on the server to put personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I tired of making the experience of rich my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pi@@ stor@@ ius transferred to the hospital in the hospital
Pi@@ stor@@ ius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
&quot; last year he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of snor@@ ing in his w@@ rists , which he suffered the pr@@ isons , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pi@@ stor@@ ius was sentenced to a first tot@@ als after a call of prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a call of prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he mo@@ w Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by placing them several times by a door of the toil@@ et@@ aker in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia on them .
&quot; pi@@ stor@@ y claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der , who was hidden in the c@@ ab . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pi@@ stor@@ ius appeals , from which they say it is to be hal@@ ted . &quot;
the National prosecution authorities said that they will be rel@@ ieve on the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year .
&quot; Pi@@ stor@@ ius is risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years , if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the flower schools , the neighborhoods of F@@ oters and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the continuing schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the det@@ ach@@ ers go to the high school in the future , four to the real school . &quot;
school @-@ chief Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house Bi@@ es@@ co in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; as a symbol of school@@ children , the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young Adler , who is up in the chicken , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ under@@ e Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Adler in the chicken . &quot;
&quot; Bauer was a strange egg , and caused it to bro@@ o@@ unce from his h@@ ens . &quot;
instead of a chicken days a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , cr@@ ashed , the Eagle turned out its wings on a high mountain and escaped his wings . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens dance with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders bore to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stand for the integration , said Schul@@ duc@@ er Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is indeed different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but their villages . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
&quot; they wish each fourth , that he feels accepted in his new school . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the colleagues followed the colleagues , the former pup@@ il of Michael Müller , who jumps again and again at under@@ gar@@ den@@ ces , and the parent company . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ aired time is now over , the teacher instruc@@ ted Sophia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
she was leaving her students for two years of teaching only very difficult because it had been a really great time .
&quot; finally , they can rely on the fourth . &quot;
&quot; finally , all the students end up a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
it broke great joy with the children .
for the new school year eight primary school are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprison@@ ed because of illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of August 1st , Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police a group of illegal refugees , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while currently an examination is running . &quot;
the Foreign Ministry reported b@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free camps and place each one who is found to stay in one place , which is not meant for this purpose to have considerable money . &quot;
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can hang out of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel Summit BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.5 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the exhaust @-@ behavior of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin by the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessment estimates :
is the new action compulsory ?
&quot; no , the negotiated software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has arranged the Automotive Office ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a full implementation in the next few months , but not an exact date . &quot;
Daim@@ ler has told to write every person concerned .
&quot; if any inspection is due , it will be done in its frame . &quot;
how long will the turn occur altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the slopes of the engagement of the manufacturer as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , voluntary act the car manufacturers on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long shall the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be it to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do not drive by BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE betra@@ y to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would consider , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
could now face a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; however , in the regions where driving bot@@ s thre@@ aten . &quot;
in rural areas there is no value loss for older Diesel .
the ACE betra@@ ys with a sale still to be seen .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ am@@ orous events in Washington .
&quot; the first prize @-@ giving under President Tru@@ mp promises to become politically , politically . &quot;
one of the winners will not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the Kul@@ tu@@ bers on Thursday announced , this year was also a singer of Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman LE@@ AR ( 95 ) . &quot;
the awards passed in early December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. president Donald Tru@@ mp will organize a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
the award @-@ called for progressive TV series called S@@ AR was therefore already announced to rel@@ inqu@@ ish the participation in the gala .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them the means - and that is charged . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an said , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to make their view clear . &quot;
that after the former president John F. Kennedy @-@ named Kennedy @-@ Center is the biggest super@@ im@@ puri@@ ties in the U.S. capital .
&quot; among the earlier lau@@ re@@ ers count Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ bles , continues in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; however , the passage is already written - suitable candidates are ra@@ r . &quot;
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ master .
and the work still makes great fun as he lets during the press talk .
&quot; he tells of varied , but also demanding tasks which wait for its successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , won@@ dro@@ us know that so far does not application the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is currently looking for architects or civil engineering at the time .
&quot; thus , in compliance with the regular cancellation deadlines - still enough time for a single operation . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach for the administrative community acts as a sub@@ sist@@ or authority , the applicant has to indicate appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill this , the citizens would have to go back to Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but the city &apos;s proximity to the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker that tells us about a good working lim@@ a as well as a good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated to look back on the ch@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; it is safe for the building and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ gan@@ park@@ platz are connected .
&quot; the Kin@@ esi@@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the state @-@ restoration is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone is to be@@ g around 1.5 million euros with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; when we make &quot; s right &quot; , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my followers . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
designed for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master large margin .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own belly and gar@@ dener can be flexibly responded to frequent .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the founding plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what pur@@ ates , if re@@ constructions are approved , empha@@ sizes the separ@@ ating city body . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ man carries a high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is builder , &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot;
&quot; during the years of service and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been a partner for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been in existence for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker desires : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain in place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company environment , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , should give information about the city of Has@@ lach , a closed studies as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor of specialist architecture , and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ stand high and low @-@ level construction , construction planning , atro@@ cities , administration of urban property , urban operation , as well as sub @-@ building authority , including reason@@ ing protection . &quot;
bike on lines are thrown : South path closed
&quot; according to the police , the blue bike had thrown into the lines far from the railway station and thrown into the lines of the Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so strongly damaged that the her@@ edi@@ ly freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male kill@@ ers and are looking for the night hours after them .
near the Tat@@ ry we were witnessed a pink sco@@ oter and a bike riders .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ ign , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
or the perpet@@ rators brought themselves into great danger and also endangered the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the system , as well as the delay of transport and the cost of railway transport , we could also send to the offen@@ ders of the railways . &quot;
&quot; let go a total of &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damage were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south side could be managed without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; just under ten person@@ ages were Friday morning , two of them consider the traffic traffic . &quot;
&quot; Gü@@ ter@@ ings did not produce , but they had delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged approximately 200 meters upper lines .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , milk products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammation ) . &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claimed exactly the opposite : a diet , which is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients with infl@@ at@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1,@@ 3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach cr@@ amps and blood si@@ eves , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the parties usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washing@@ toner University out that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins were contributing to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to make sure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide in the food not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in infl@@ amed intestinal diseases . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immun@@ o@@ cells in mice occurs , which carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins to dis@@ solve the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - who is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , rich diet toler@@ ant , less infl@@ amed intestinal cycles , if the same system is also wir@@ led by men . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral doc@@ torate in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance than it found that a group of study people had such cells , but another group of the same trunk , which was not separated . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ans had to do - the communion of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the intest@@ ine intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the dam@@ s of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ encing and there were six bacterial types found , which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them mis@@ ses with the mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a steri@@ le environment , giving them a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not develop this kind of immune @-@ cell , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immun@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria could grow on the immune system , the researchers let L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a fluid and then resulted in small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were ins@@ ulated by the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant con@@ veying cells .
&quot; as the active component of the fluid has been puri@@ fied , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ Mil@@ k acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ger decreased , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ anced cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i can develop the cells in men as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory ... &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ger can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ es M@@ atic , &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der player on Wednesday night his debut against Samp@@ it had . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A Super Cup vs Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impres@@ sing at the H@@ age &apos;s role as people like Paul Sz@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , MA@@ TIC was excluded from the prepar@@ atory @-@ Asia tour of the blues and gave only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho did that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium , called M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent unveil@@ ed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho did not wish to wish three more commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club already has a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority re@@ plac@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this I would like to thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four out of four , but they have given great difficulty . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers into the sky .
&quot; the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing started out in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar schir@@ i the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertisement .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing &apos;s logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; however , as the wind turns again : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still SPD chef , was always a social @-@ democratic prime minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely no interference from the party central , merely no counter @-@ wind from the covenant - so loud the most important desire of the electoral campa@@ ign@@ ing . &quot;
Martin Schulz has changed the party since Martin Schulz has changed fundamentally .
&quot; since then , the employees have seen from the Willy Brandt @-@ Haus with growing dism@@ ay the events in the SPD @-@ governed national capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , it would not be described in the approach with counter@@ wind . &quot;
there were heavy attacks .
and this one after another .
the CD@@ U &apos;s CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the Board of Edi@@ tors in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising question of a Green Party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens Executive Director Michael Kellner has prompted the apost@@ asy out of the Lower Saxony @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return its mandate .
the crossing to CD@@ U means a clear distor@@ tion of the constitu@@ encies .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately give her mandate back , &quot; &quot; said the federal leader and voting wing of the Gre@@ ens to the Editor &apos;s Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; sigh@@ s a SPD electoral campa@@ ign@@ ing , when on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ e was reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green Members El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD @-@ state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland &apos;s election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the comrades of his time . &quot;
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia all will be different .
this was then also - and indeed it was clearly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ ite Haute the party smooth . &quot;
&quot; pain@@ stak@@ ingly , the comrades in the weeks thereafter again . &quot;
&quot; then when she had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next break .
&quot; Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD tour , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his city . &quot;
and because he did so pretty much the wrong way of crisis communication about what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
&quot; because of the VW exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische Prime Minister has already been in criticism . &quot;
mi@@ ese re@@ port@@ ations were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely , trying to put more attention in the federal government in the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the pursuit of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , as they said from W@@ eil a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
&quot; now , the exact opposite could happen . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , W@@ eil meets the party @-@ party office is basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz at all not at all .
&quot; sometimes , the comrades endeavour to hold their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; your anger is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the id@@ ols of the female parliam@@ ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , like Ms T@@ jack@@ ets their own career entry over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Par@@ eil@@ les in the SPD @-@ Bundestag ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ ard is not elected because of her person as direct can@@ did@@ atin , but has been elected by the country of Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in the Parliament , so the Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische MP . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD group , lam@@ ents an &quot; non @-@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the vote for four years ago was clear : people made Stephan W@@ eil to Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische SPD as a leader in the Bundestag to the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career give a future CD@@ U members to the W@@ ah@@ er@@ result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called to clear the background .
I want to know if there has been more or more advanced ple@@ dges of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
sponsors for local core III
who wants to re@@ fine his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative St@@ eg Urban Development on Wednesday in received . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once again a review of the previous one .
since 1991 there has been in delicate san@@ itation areas .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg have passed over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 the grant was still 60 percent .
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the former refur@@ bish@@ ops are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the internal development and not only develop new building areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , one was given the information on the Government of the Government of Karlsruhe , that there will be a san@@ itation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which were more than 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the community . &quot;
how is now a renovation area ?
&quot; one will continue to examine so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role whether in the planned area at all interest rate .
&quot; if necessary , the territory could then move again . &quot;
the stables on Wednesday night Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; in the basement presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; Social City , &quot; in whose context the refur@@ bish@@ ments would then be performed . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of internal towns , the improvement of the residential and employment relationships and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be obj@@ ectively covered , that is done per property . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment area would finally be defined as statute .
the authorization period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
&quot; until September this year , however , would only once again take stock of inventory , as part of those who want to fill out a questionnaire regarding the renovation area . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the purpose of the statutes shall be made possible , so that in the coming year it can be started with the refur@@ bish@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained , that every commune would have to carry out the preliminary studies . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore , the city &apos;s urban ab@@ norm@@ alities to evaluate and decide when restoration is being restored and what extent . &quot;
it will then also be registered for the respective land .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come once again to sensitive , and get a picture of the situation , she spoke . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the questionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property &quot; &quot; where there is among other things about the construc@@ tional condition and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; can be made according to size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot;
the blue &quot; arc &quot; is only re@@ plen@@ ished if in the building business rooms are operated .
&quot; however , in mind , Got@@ zel pointed out that a fulfilling questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler said that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ mill principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first comes first . &quot;
&quot; you can not make any funds for later &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a renovation &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British inventor raises itself a micro@@ chip to come up with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ tish inventor is the first in the country which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door@@ step , its office enter and even start his car with a hand . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has concluded with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ esthe@@ tics at Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
the married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the value costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a marine helicopter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American production last month costs pay@@ ers according to the details of the military , which were left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24.@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
the helicopter helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Maine over a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ k@@ lift from Mississippi .
&quot; the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn landed , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I only wanted that you are aware of this , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the Vice @-@ Marin@@ at@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 am in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and for as long as the lawn remained vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service , a second team for the return flight would be required . &quot;
the original plane was found during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of unity during the period remained on the plane .
the records made available from the TI@@ ME is not clear if ultimately a second plane was required .
&quot; the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal , state @-@ owned property for political purposes . &quot;
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event might hurt the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , the dep@@ uty commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a impetus for the reform of the health reform that was underway at the Senate , and he pro@@ pped the efforts to da@@ w@@ ning the government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the airplane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial uses is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; but to demand their use only for a photo surgery , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp led a study in February as the presidential aircraft in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential system by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries , demonstrated by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Minister of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training excursions in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn in order to de@@ duce the US President in the White House with precise centimeters .
&quot; at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out in the White House 58 exercises . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event enum@@ er@@ ated by the training requirement for the month , said an official . &quot;
Heli@@ x units also flew in addition to 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential supporters . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other re@@ pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company had not been involved in receiving the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget @-@ design@@ ations for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ sts of the U.S. Department of Defence , for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ package fee for the v@@ H @-@ 3D is however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of unity see the flight time of the plane than 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the equipment sets is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs , included in annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to an Rand @-@ study from 2015 , the fittings for DO@@ D not included personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former pres@@ ses@@ cher of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ital , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ital . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I &apos;m assum@@ ing that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is natural to highlight this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ acting with the Hel@@ icop@@ ter , when he betra@@ yed his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down into the seat of a fire@@ man &apos;s seat . &quot;
in the White House Tru@@ mp spoke to a representative of Si@@ kor@@ sky and scher@@ rolled with the media over his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before a tricky task
leader of the Second tennis Bundes@@ liga is in the Tab@@ l@@ ending Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the Tab@@ l@@ ending Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
&quot; despite the five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance sheet , the peak of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has retained the sense of reality . &quot;
team@@ manager Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which is always in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; precisely on the back positions , I find the team very well . &quot;
&quot; especially imports from the high north , especially for the class and stability of the S@@ V @-@ dor@@ fer S@@ V . &quot;
&quot; their abilities and Finn@@ s may even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , as well as Andreas Bj@@ s@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; it will be as always hard for us .
&quot; you need a good serving luck . &quot;

back@@ wards : the city presents 46 kitchen
the city organized the K@@ ita @-@ lunch itself again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban children &apos;s day@@ trips the watch will be re@@ directed .
&quot; for September 1st , the city Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban children &apos;s daily facilities ( Kit@@ as ) in self @-@ reg@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , dep@@ uty director in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we all have been very pleased . &quot;
&quot; cooked except house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task , and delivers fresh @-@ cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ e@@ fields of 46 children &apos;s daily sites , in 44 children get a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; last year , there are 2@@ 800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , the 45 hours of hours are taken care of , in the K@@ ita , explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour support when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 Parti@@ cip@@ ants have dinner service : they war@@ med the advanced food , add them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give the food from , clean , rin@@ se , and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are walls as well as seventh facilities - decides over the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier for the male @-@ operation , educational and educational concepts . &quot;
because that &apos;s why it is : healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen workers - is settled in the future by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance even the charm that it has proven to be the cost of the city as the most economical , it is from the Press Office . &quot;
&quot; and that , even though 46 sections can be re @-@ employed . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at about 750 people in the gu@@ ardian of even not so strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the Afgh@@ ans democracy depends on the political role of women .

&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in an statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credible when women are fully participating and included in all parts of the election process .
the elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections are held on 5 April .
the Taliban have released threats against a election process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international fight treatments to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be given the power of peace from a democratically elected government to the next one . &quot;
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women to strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .

GM@@ B @-@ concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union would like to have a long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow in the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie over the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
&quot; GM@@ B Scotland said , the company turned out over the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ Location . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the work , next to other products hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
&quot; during the last few years , Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said , he invested more than 5 million pounds over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Fili@@ al@@ manager of the company , GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express their concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; GM@@ B @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win over the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members deeply . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the labor force concentrate strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , pay@@ roll and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising costs of life and of the chronic production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needed a fl@@ ori@@ an production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a speaker at Pla@@ i said , &quot; &quot; Fili@@ berto manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it since we value the continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had a regular meeting with colleagues and GM@@ B representatives in T@@ oll@@ us@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
we discussed with the staff that we operate as all companies working in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic climate . our business is continuously checked - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive .
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site , and all of them should change our operations at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t release after her persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having released an offer of £ 189 million in order to trigger his clut@@ ch clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ ant ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record by more than double of the previous brand , with Paul Sz@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional athl@@ ete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out there , although a source near the Catal@@ ans state insi@@ sted that the club always gave its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago from the PS@@ G president in front of this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know when they touch one of our players , then we will contact opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign in , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have passed this line , whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ Middle fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not permit the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of their price offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report &quot; Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( report to the ab@@ uses of Pope Bene@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and historians Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report on the ab@@ norm@@ ality of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ , spokes@@ man of the reform@@ ist movement &quot; &quot; We are Church &quot; , &quot; stated after publication opposite the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agency , he continued from the former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig , the 93 @-@ year &apos;s brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger , its deepest regret of its own sub@@ missions , or her then incorrect evaluation of processes would be expressed . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , he critici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence in the domain @-@ cats with &quot; two @-@ measure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to doubt about the transgres@@ sions in Regensburg , nobody knows that it would be prevented by &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts &quot; react ; it is striking but the &quot; degree medi@@ al Mani@@ p@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; thus the &quot; &quot; degree medi@@ al Mani@@ p@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; thus the &quot; &quot; degree medi@@ al Mani@@ p@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; thus the &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; histor@@ i@@ ker@@ chief and a member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit to design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion in mind that for normal &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church , and that is a frozen fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; it also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; stro@@ kes have been a completely normal pedago@@ gic means &quot; &quot; to live with friends , as I was one was to be finished . &quot;
&quot; they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
in connection with the reports on the abuse of mis@@ inci@@ dents often the Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly wrong , author and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who talked to the &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; in 12 languages ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 rainbow @-@ cats have been ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plur@@ ality &quot; victims of over@@ accessed , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; &quot; in summary , it is clear that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and psych@@ ic violence have been applied . &quot;
especially at high E@@ moti@@ on@@ ality the punishment for the pupils could become even more veh@@ ement .
&quot; nevertheless in contrast to numerous other signs , many victims falls the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , H@@ es@@ emann , why the final report on the ab@@ norm@@ alities of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence against prot@@ esters at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students stand out his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the other he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who has been tangible , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz does not have a top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate the bio@@ graph of this final report ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you are reading the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all in it . &quot;
he is dedicated to eight sites and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by any susp@@ ici@@ on of the intermedi@@ ary or fellow @-@ knowledge among the terrible cases sexual abuse .
&quot; also , the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school occurred outside of its effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to take it at least , learn from it too late or have taken the first hint not seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the cathedral @-@ scrat@@ ched school , on which he acted , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - &quot; &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very excellent witness , described him as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; , &quot; prof@@ icient , and &quot; understand@@ ful &quot; , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who cat@@ ered the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always enc@@ amped by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high aci@@ on@@ ality , which also led to wre@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only blow with chairs and bow@@ ed the key@@ chains , but also ear@@ phones and got too fre@@ ak boys in hair or ears , he himself did not complain about years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be said that such gu@@ ardians were widely used in the fra@@ gment period , the 1960s and the 1970s , were widely used , with parents like in teachers . &quot;
do you also know such bre@@ eder methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a cosm@@ opolitan school , a state grammar school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and non@@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , are the detached Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
then you wonder whether it &apos;s not rather with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ V@@ I. to do that many media just cr@@ ashed on him .
&quot; in the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him , still eager . &quot;
the truth is : the report reli@@ eved Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also placed some distor@@ ting or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual acc@@ esses claimed to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; I never sinned , with my father or mother to talk about it , &quot; said a subject of sufferers for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem for enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are not silent .
&quot; if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral manager , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student r@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers play a role in terms of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a respon@@ dent student s@@ ulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely findings and the respective perpet@@ rators could have been stopped .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that there would be mature or more clear or even more clearly , as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ managers , trust instruc@@ tors etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that the students involved in advance and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the study . &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thus acqu@@ itted of any co @-@ knowledge .
&quot; thus it cannot be accused of him , not prevented or put it to the display . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to connect his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately , in some cases it happened . &quot;
&quot; in the media was a lot of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will look forward in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that is again a abuse of the report .
&quot; namely , it is clean separately : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asium of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence , we say once , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the report comes from time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases where l@@ ad of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ cking teachers were controlled and mal@@ ign@@ ited , and among them all ent@@ ails , were all found at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have . &quot;
&quot; but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ enzeit@@ ung school . &quot;
&quot; on the way , as the most witnesses emphasize , the theme &quot; &quot; school &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; it was just happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment , and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions . &quot;
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ ection School ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was a discipline , but there was no sa@@ di@@ ous violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims gathered the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; thus , at most still the pro@@ ach , have to be taken away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ schule . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school , where he didn &apos;t want to hear and responsible , ( such a witness ) had nothing to hear , and then back to 1993 . &quot;
closures Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently the ears consistently in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ enzeit@@ ung , the report even re@@ produces . &quot;
in this he shows that he will continue to be practi@@ sed in the pre @-@ school .
already in view of the risk of negative press coverage he recommended an urgent objection .
&quot; this was of course at a time when legal clarity was , when testing was banned in Bavaria too long ago . &quot;
&quot; before , they found themselves in a legal gray area , like everyone of us probably knows . &quot;
there was hard to cher@@ ish him where those affected might have been exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the allowed border has been exceeded .
&quot; but one cannot say , he had always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
only in the year 1980 the testing was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed it , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards for the then time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we were talking about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger , past and to evaluate the present moral standards . &quot;
the Princess has already been right .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse that was ab@@ om@@ in@@ ous at all times and also not for what was broken down in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence at un@@ trained children &apos;s population , which goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
&quot; but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ching , thus ear@@ cher and to pull in hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , it has been forbidden , he has also kept strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what image of his rainy time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ? &quot;
came the topic audi@@ ted to the language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , relates out of his perspective , as the cathedral @-@ cats played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not at all that he conducted a stric@@ test regim@@ ent there . &quot;
&quot; but that has to be said once again : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the un@@ inten@@ dent discipline , it would hardly be possible to form an institution of world @-@ known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( 1983 and 1987 ) and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1991 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone one does not make a big singer and stand before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well met and repeatedly experienced as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , angry and hearty good people from which you could not imagine that he could have only a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former cathedral store still today , 23 years after its em@@ eri@@ ority , regular contact with him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him up to today , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are today thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , pat@@ tern@@ ed teacher - a hard father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect person , to which they still look up and worship them straight . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clear : everything you have pre @-@ casts , are gu@@ ardians that were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have overcome this time ago .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , only because it is prominent and an even more prominent brother has to make the medi@@ al s@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention that stands behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eved him . &quot;
&quot; now , the set @-@ up areas would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bay@@ erns and perhaps in Germany nobody would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
