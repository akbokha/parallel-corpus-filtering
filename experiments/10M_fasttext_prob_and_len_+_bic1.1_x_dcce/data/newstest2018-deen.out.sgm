<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas in Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but just therefore very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compares them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then it will be clear, as cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century have changed."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork, which one does not recognize as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture postcard, for cities and municipalities were detailed maps, so-called urpositional sheets, incorporated."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the specifications of the Bayerische Vermeasurable administration between 1810 and 1864 and skip the first verse Bayerns.</seg>

<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische Vermeasurable Management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional blatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"compared to early / Today, the example of the provincial capital is most impressive."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded itself in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is undersendling that emerges in the map of 1856 or relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was set up 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as Münchner district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the sendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Lower spring focus around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße which was named after 1878 to Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the western park is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when editing a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered plots from the so-called" urine ", derived from which the basic tax has been derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots do not occupy there any farmers, but small gardeners of the plant" land in the sun. "</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 swings of the October, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">In the urgency of the present district Au-Haidhausen not only reads the street names' at the guest 'or from the ascent "On the ventilation" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here on the auction-chamber times people were killed people with insanity."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner district of Irrenanstalt" "was created in 1858 / 59."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden, the institution - that Psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for example the dressing of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he is forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the occupants", "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution."</seg>
<seg id="37">"initially, for 280 patients was first place, later was extended to 500 seats."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point these capacity does not happen again - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"it has been there since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">At the Areal of the former Auer Anstalt we meet young people at Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and walked it in a youth home with training."</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football ground of the TSV Munich East, East residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children-house" Casa Don Bosco "" was built in architecturally based on the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II at bombing attacks. "</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was ranked as" "main square", "the Kaufingerstraße was" "Kaufinger street". ""</seg>

<seg id="50">Civil rights group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Incolored has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri, who will come into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouanians to take special attention in travel through the state, as a number of fragmentary, rally-based incidents in the entire state occur and here", "it is in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to win discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to publish the travel cancellation, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of citizens' rights to pass people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are collapsed or killed," "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency which we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group incidents such as racist forces go against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, having had no fuel during the journey by the State and taken by the police of Missouri, without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also pointed out a recent report by the Office of the General State Department of Missouri, which will be shown that black motorists in the state shall be 75 percent more common than pasture."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families, friends and staff to inform about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready if there are chewing money or the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri signed up to 100 hate in 2015 according to the latest figures from the hate-reporting program of the FBI - the state in relation to the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to disguise a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Code Union (ACLU) Travel warnings issued for Texas and Arizona, having passed the local prosecution authorities to offense people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further broadening agents."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Pastoring project is elementary.</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisher fishing project is a success project and continues to continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag Peter White and Kordula Kovac have gained a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the rectangle of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the fishing village of CDU-local association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his farm, in which he served 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cells and as many young animals provided and housed in five apartments holiday guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Schwarzwalmilk" "is responsible for him of the alternate marketer path for the milk of his cows, so Schwennann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the guests only registrar.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV-chairman of Fisherbach, he describes the consecration project as an" elementary project. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green space for a lot of work, a lot of need to be edited with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "said Schwennann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the elterous operation, and processed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not conduct a biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the meaning of the consecration project and is happy with the leaders."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">You hope that the forforestation of the areas could still be taken out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operations," "said the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism for the promotion of</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the reserve space is around 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the total costs of 71 500 Euros was funded by the total cost of 71 500 euro, a quarter carried by the municipality of Fisbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers love the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres pasture."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwennann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and rural women."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White was firm: "here best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The agricultural policy-linear (LPR) Baden-Württemberg makes it possible to state the state promotion of pastas.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the posture of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one developed by the LPR-named conveyor.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the protectable surface must not be fished (Hangneigh over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by disarmament."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fishing project 2018 it is currently running at the request of eight participants with 24 plots, which we would like to build up just 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the reserve space corresponds to 35 hectares, the cold costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer is it when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the careful overthrowing Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump régime, certainly knew what he did, when he took a symbolic Axt in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals made by the President for the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not hold the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have suffered him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid hold on their significance, and in particular the importance that you have written, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"Miller Acosta shaded:" "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to the later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly informed right, but as he formatted it, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state will not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your fatigue, your poor, / your depressed masses, who are going to breathe free, / the eleventh waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "miserable waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not committed to literary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and their friends who put themselves to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they accomplished a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by shown the female embodiment of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she himself gives himself a very different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a disastrous attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, the people wanted to change from the right wing this long."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not one-load, but rather an early neo-conservative, which is the American flame in the converted world:" Lady Liberty is proceeding. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It shall bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not meant to enlighten the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Pretty unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely at all a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from the exhaustive, but hopeful men after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people, seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever wish to recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch is not meant to enlighten the way, but the hatred, which is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish Members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle recalls that at a time when only two shepherds belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member consoles will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special" "develops and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has done something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle were elected by the team for the team of team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was amazing," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or where they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the genuine feeling, which Eiliie brought quite naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal, which is at the 400-m hurdle with the 400-m hurdle, says that it is" incredible "that 16 jackets are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes on the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">Muir conducts Muir on this path and last year five British and two European Records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m is running, is another Sote that one should observe the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle recalls her first World Championships as the only other Schotte in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the occupants testified that they are" "hugely proud" "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team but in some cases also in the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about the team captain in it is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was anyway a great honour, but to know that my team mates voted for me and chose me to make something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the brisk, who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to rise on ships."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as chapters?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home World Championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there, and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: do not block yourself to a public office if you do not tolerate the injuncing of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our land knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers followed him due to all, from internal policy to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He shook with criticism.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led to battles to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">"Hogans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted, which expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Code declared it this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the stops from the Governors left the lawsuit as a frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with" "Na, and?". ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a guy like hoganese.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republique governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hoganese is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He showed a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to manipulate himself with his voters and to debate its hair-free head on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of individuals who come to the side of the Governors - which is to be officially designated as officially and by employees working with public tax currency - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defending Hoist Sprecherin Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolling or spammers or hassertive people, which vibrate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful, and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor found the Bible in his post and appealed to hogans of Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Lawyers Lakshmi sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked for hate."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and gave other current news, she wrote in the comment section of the message" The Post. ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not value this idea if a number of people is taking place on the same subject, then it will be misused by some more than a so-called collective action, and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governors said as" "concentrated Spam attack", "others would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a reviewer or delete a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much clean than in former times when you have done the same that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines, to burn or to forge protesters and to sweat."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what is happening in digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">"Hogan is not the first public official, which is criticised for it that he has implied Facebook and other social media."</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is lamented by Twitter-users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County gave the first Amendment, according to U.S. District Apostle James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she named a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Been (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of an affordable portos had a similar effect on the internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800 and anonymous letins to his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the alias" "Valerius", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", "wrote all letters to newspapers, Washington's decisions made."</seg>
<seg id="202">"Petitions, which criticised its position on the contract of Amity, the trade and navigation with Great Britain, was overwhelmed by the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought them to silence.</seg>

<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former bank with a passion for real estate, resized by a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer on this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first tour, the 1,000 square meters has been completely rebuilt."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally a one-room estate with a spared layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add joanne, storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"this was my request," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose they put the architecture and designer studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Fan had to be creative thinking to solve the default.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is fairly complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so arrange that they were overshadowed, without having to fill ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed it Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine looks a classic clutch window of retrouvius, about the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold-furniture, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination put the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short walk is mirrored to work for him longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the spider feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we have mirrored units for all bristles and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamourless space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went in," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterimportant, so it is when you push the door to push-up, very easy."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain extra 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate makler will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, you have managed to enlarge the ground surface and at the same time use high quality materials that get the room to offer its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional connection in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>

<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Stabernef of the White House, at his first working day with leading employees, he presented a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to fix: bad information that fall into the hands of the President."</seg>

<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to enumerate Trump by supervise its media."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship with television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if promising Trump was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were to convince" "said the former electoral consultant Sam Nunberg in February against Politico."</seg>

<seg id="1403">We will probably never know something about the Tweets which has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff had to hold it several times, aggravation of him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"but no one has to prevent it consistently, that Trump sets forth."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that men in a White House which sets out from competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump's material, that may also promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of consultants, the president of strategic reasons for doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporters Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump beamer say that Trump can react as a volcano on negative press cuts, especially such with shameful leaks, and that he finds himself to figure out where these originate."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February, when somebody gave a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet-provocate Charles C. Johnson, called the deputy rod in Katie Walsh, to be the source behind a bunch of leaks in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was banned from Twitter to Twitter or that he has no specific evidence, or that he voiced false accusations in the past and voke them in the past."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask employees about Walsh.</seg>

<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his adviser still strive towards influence."</seg>

<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services enquiring the Kremlin for a longer time to be targeted at the presidential election in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were interruptions between Trumps electoral team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are standing in the election campaign as a consultant of the republicans."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to that, Mueller also took more and more Trumps private and business environment under the magnifier."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" Washington Post "wrote a few weeks ago that the special handler Trump has personally moved to the center and seek the draft, whether the President may not hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Jurys, it is to examine and decide whether an indictment is to be collected."</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called accusations.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when it concerns larger and controversy cases.</seg>

<seg id="1523">A danger for people does not go out from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">In what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the ice is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, there has been a series of uncommon interruptions of Eisschelfen in the region since about 30 years, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can interact with the warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken coloss was so far a part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by great glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is constantly growing into the sea and regularly breaks down.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfiis is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"north of this heart, the balance of waxes and abruptions were disturbed before a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a full Schelfei is there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"I am talking about it, that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front sepulses have never been so far withdrawn as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice plate stand under tension and could fall, if there is a piece in a key place."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg increases the seallevel, as it is pushed down on the water and pushed into the ice as much water as it appears after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the case leads to the glacier directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only in low dimensions, writes the British research project on the observation of the Antarctica (MIDAS)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">Larsen-C-Schelfeis is named after AWI-statements with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the four-biggest shelist of the Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, on the edge to the free ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and is not conscious of a direct connection to climate change, the icshield comes now into a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the biggest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," confirmed too. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"under scientists be controversial, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfei will now be back and possibly collapsed, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers have failed to withdraw the breakup of this gigantic iceberg not on climate change, so in the past decades there are many ice-shielves of the Antarctic peninsula."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long run of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey the ice-surface of the Antarctic peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employee of the Weekly Riodoce meet, normally, meet their plans for the reporting of recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">"it was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with granulates, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug regulators, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no silence of violence, and throughout the country the corpses were frequent, and more journalists have joined: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 stand after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter you will find editors and their inspirator from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas. "</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist, wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack will be deep informed, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows its mid finger with the word" Justice "," hanging on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the three-thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry on his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut. "</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, trauma, their alpenges, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 has been established a Sonder-Federal Office to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only introduced two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of Morden, who are connected with drug-trading and organised crime, the murderers of journalists will only be rare in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are untruncated, and although the terrain is still in stock."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time in this workshop is wasting", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know why, we mitigate all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive just a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" "Twelder River". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius continued in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest in the past year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloody battlefields of the country, as rival groups struggle to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people will be shot on the street, or that the cemetery is full of finely two-story moueen for drug addicts that are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" peace, "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartoons in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may be annoyed the sons, suspected gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country with his own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killings is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were saying that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste as he joined together with five colleagues on the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to run journalism without having to come across the rudote problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time, the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and the turnover and advertising took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it, hard to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories, which nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce received it the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever she ran."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trading in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that falls you as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I would not want to be asked," What have you done about so many Toters... why did you not say what went before? "</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team is missing Valdez, the spa-bird, who was like a port worker, the friend who knew generous with hugs and advice, a teacher, who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his guard.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayama, the bar towards the office, go and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"well, ask: was his love to be routine?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on question, how to do their work best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home startup and cross-ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of censorship and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">To trust his own instinct.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" smell can become a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier is happening. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, apply in Zaloa no longer - just as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where an toxic mixture of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government offices are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days previously was known that Spyware issued exclusively to governments, to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were seeking protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were asked by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story house in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asking if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers, which the governor itself is as untrusted."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drugs standing de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce left on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state of state that focused on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the office of the prosecutor's office, carried out a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who has been kidnapped, or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write, what everybody in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally produced by drug retailers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter was made from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy that the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri) belongs almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri-Governors were accused of high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal bat the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local eatery, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman came to a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"a few months before, the readers would have seen the Colomne of Valdez as the most informed source about the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "" because of his slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been a storage space for signs and stickers, which are dedicated against the killings of journalists who have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporepers Miriam Ramirez snapped up a few signs and passed the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing, that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country journalists have become stronger, by acting in organised protests" SOS Press "on walkers and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day the director of Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez was accused of authorities, journalists loosing and bring them to them, because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has been asked since then to be divided by the government, because they are concerned that their anger has injured their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico by organised crime, involved in government officials and a similar society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco journal, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug policies, but also on the command of politicians and security forces, with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"the" "Articulo 19" "group was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the last year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico-minded you think, because they want you diskeep the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have an abrupt effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found together with a note that allegedly was signed by the Zetas-Kartell," "Here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer-buttons and earphones in addition to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some stores will be elected as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua following the assassination of the correspondents Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as there was El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her Director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly set up the drug box with an article on the front page with the headline "What do you want from us?</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they will be hunted, as it was apparently murdered by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain returning and continuing work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, gives me that the drug trading is frightened him."</seg>

<seg id="1912">"at midnight last Friday, when the last edition was already terminated, the editors of Riodoce on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer than once all their phones began to be summoned."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of showeries with bandaging and security guards near the beach Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed tote.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated on how it was promised by a number of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the logistic edge they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phones.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic is the armored plant-vores that best preserves its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something, which seemed from the surrounding rocks at the board, and decided to look more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">That discovered by him fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you want to blinking just a little with eyes, you might almost believe that it has slept", "said the captain Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant-vores, even though he is covered with armor and a changing tank, probably by meat and sent dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology that is known as a backlist, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix themselves better in its surroundings and to soften his enemies, say experts, what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier has taken place in May for the first time and is now to be seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called es Borealopelta markers according to the museum technology Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the form of scales and armor about his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shaded, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shaded is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it points out that the dinosaurs was hunted by enough pressure by meat and sent dinosaurs, that evolution was favoured by the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter-shaded - think of deer, zebras, or gondolas - are much smaller and vulnerable as booty, which signaled that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carnivored behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs carnivores have been to have been," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life, including his concerthalted to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, driven into a river, and drifted into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosaurier is really remarkable because he is fully covered with consistent skin, but also in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly as in the early Kreidezeit.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Kreideem was a time, as a huge spa, carnivorous dinosaur that stood on two legs, the earth went through."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrible ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tonnes of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Portal, believe that Borealopelta was broadcasted after death in the sea and is classified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was near to Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the supper armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were weighed on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20 inch long tips from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored crop-vores were stirred by the Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after they arrived in New York City, sat in St. Louis in the bed of an Airbnb apartment they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused because nobody else had posted on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was continually worshipped at its timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., killed live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He postete a picture of Browns leaning body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," figured Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone later in order to go back to Tweets on people on the Canfield drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and the people who cried, and by a man who commanded, browsing father, who carried a sign with the wording:" Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live feed in which a policeman was standing in front of a group of protesters with a bellished dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, uninsured a different policeman is his rifle and crying:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," remembered Ferrell to their statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">That is not the kind of murder we have accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and crying. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return trip and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson in the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "," in the cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, the strength and the resistance, which consists of the perspective of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a Ferrell with her daughter who carried a flower-dress and a suitable crown, according to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" remember, what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not correct."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them with," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happens today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It needs to know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience ecclant racism, it is not different from the next black women-child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, located at the South Flissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp-area, as the activists on the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there was Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner, the lunch made."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and halves they pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new type of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August totally changed," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food fairness and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met for an evening-demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to just" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question occurred Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community who benefited from her pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area, which is known for his activism around Todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his dedication brought Ferrell the project closer, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns Ershoot."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," "Davis said."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, as I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not a messiah leader, but about a community that comes together," said Folayan - they proved to be the most obvious participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, the documents of" Whose Streets show "" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life, how she fell in love with her and married her wife. "</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the worship of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris history repeated the role of black swowls women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as pregnant."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry out the main load of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan unanimously to notice that "the movement is really kept up by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it exists that" this is not a affirmative type of action, "in Ferrell, due to their identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although it was at the front front, because with a life at these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile the communication enkameras in Ferguson has long gone, but the racial ties between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on local currency for 2 ½ years due to the blocktion of a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"she describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area, which they call their home:" a mess. "</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she cloned to a song and she feels committed to this memory, since she went over three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size wahn": TV-reader discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves people, although it is still not built long."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the sweetness of the pedestrian precinct, since the first presentation of 2009 the population was engaged in advocates and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold cuts the topic hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Popular and Bitburg" will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"saying one to the bit-Galerie:" "that would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" "This would be genuine" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "needs no man" "(Siggi Bise) or quite simple:" "size wahn!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, of which the remaining shops are benefiting, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian zone bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farm market hall is available in the 13 direct market-market."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of construction work will be the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie-Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to the Beda place with possibility of sitting outside sitting.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying almost every week in the farm market hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm are always happy to be very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There are other cities in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether direct market presence in a market hall in the gallery, arrives at the height of the rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, it might not be too low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's shopping cart in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugums or supermarkets: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"of this, there is already enough in our city."</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many charges are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"however, since it is not even a weekly market, it is all the more important that at least get the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered are fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is above all inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop transactions are reserved in a shopping centre only by major companies, because they are often not portable for a retailer often."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special transactions there are almost no more and what still exists, then will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit for Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the farm market hall during the period of construction?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery will actually come.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the spectrost bit gallery previously to distribute all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, also nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall it will give it thanks to the wahnsinging many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg has no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market hall was broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost incomparably same - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and Haarle which were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where the former Secret service analyst took a 35-year prison sentence after they made public news on the website WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becurresembur (an appropriate similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was unified in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and pioneering discourse that had been converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which could be extracted from Manning, as anyone with these genomic data might look, a sharp if any intellectual comment may not only be made to the formbosis of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the indurism determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since its puberty, was sentenced to 2013 because of 20 accusations, including six violations of the SpionageAct, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"by the prison its picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one single photo - a granular, black-white selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and a platinblonde perishing has been associated with which it was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of its 2012-project 'stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette lighter and chewing gum by throwing the DNA from the drop to produce an image of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they brought an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and their detainted mines were unequal to an unequal spectacle, which were interchangeable over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"she even illustrates one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic" Suppressed Images, "who would foresee a future in which the President Chelicing verdict would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, credentials would call for seven brutal years in a military coup in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happier meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little deeper and tribal, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweet paths that it should actually remedy, continue to deflate."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery's written artistic statement called Manning with its superior signature among them (the" "i" "in their surname is equipped with a heart) an end to the" automatic fragmentation, whose basis has been the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and GS, and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"hoped, hoped by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological ways, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully take with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows manning, as they appear with a hands-preefon in the hand from the secretary of the United States as King-Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they set up your speech, then they won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so we never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greeted me from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get geek, when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition even personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the center of the room from the masks, composed by their own genomic simulations, which collapsed as hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also target-oriented, as everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Mannings Statur), in which her genetic Haploggroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowds", "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, which formed with Chelsea, as the movement, which also hidden behind her liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 2014" Dead Men's Teeth and Stories Stories, "a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he was unexpected emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted to the thumb of a letter on the side of a letter that was written by a double-car in the 1700-century, who worked for the Jacobins," says he. "</seg>

<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landlords, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who worked with the illustrations of his book."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought, that it can not be more crazy, a new report comes across the technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robotic in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emerized professor for robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingers."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them still much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpo have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions to be achieved through the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, and choose everything from the eye-color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is even more disturbing, since many robots have the" "personalities", "which would seem to be a steppe woman."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern senses have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt its robots to the properties that they are appealing to such as student."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is still the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of relentarity and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous personality. "</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the site of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she don't like what you do not like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, fixed on congestion or she can be" "in mood." ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the underscores of female properties, the anavers on rape, if one enters a step to Frigid (is said here: resisting) Farrah is unquiet one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, this sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sexbacon."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper into our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjection to an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course keep no sex robot, and while the FRR notices their rising popularity, they still remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what weathered out of the boundary zones, in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange, or hurry to give them the free market there."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain reasoning that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there has been a president in the White House who has been blamed to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the abrupt aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tales' ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphical images, the sleeptive body and the outochenen eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want to feel humane that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to its" "personalities," the robots represent no real women. "</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no placement or background-story, nothing, what is hindered to independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House is everyone who knows her, including the Republican kinship, having fought for centuries because of politics, suddenly and very peculiar on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"to the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this also involves significant risks."</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammation). "</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claimed exactly the opposite: a diet, which is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflatology."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, which affects approximately 1,3 million and in the UK 300,000, causes stomach cramps and blood sieves, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the parties usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University out that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins were contributing to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to make sure that harmful microbes, which hide in the food not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflamed intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, a kind of tolerance-promoting immunocells in mice occurs, which carry a specific bacterium in their initiates."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to dissolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - who is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one to Tryptophan, rich diet tolerant, less inflamed intestinal cycles, if the same system is also wirled by men."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral doctorate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance than it found that a group of study people had such cells, but another group of the same trunk, which was not separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbians had to do - the communion of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the intestine intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the dams of the mice were found DNA sequencing and there were six bacterial types found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them misses with the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment, giving them a intestinal microbiom and they did not develop this kind of immune-cell, and they received the L. reuteri and the immunisation."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria could grow on the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a fluid and then resulted in small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were insulated by the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant conveying cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the fluid has been purified, it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as an Indol-3-Milk acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanger decreased, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same toleranced cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach-intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri can develop the cells in men as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory..."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially high tryptophanger can lead to an expansion of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2886">"it may be good according to the accident, that the Mercedesdriver had not noticed the accident at all."</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report" Pope brother Georg Ratzinger "</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen (report to the abuses of Pope Beneatzinger's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means author and historians Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abnormality of the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weissen, spokesman of the reformist movement" "We are Church", "stated after publication opposite the Deutsche Presse-Agency, he continued from the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig, the 93-year's brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much when Müller and Ratzinger, its deepest regret of its own submissions, or her then incorrect evaluation of processes would be expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" "Osservatore Romano", "on the other hand, he criticized that in the reporting of violence in the domain-cats with" two-measure "." "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"to doubt about the transgressions in Regensburg, nobody knows that it would be prevented by" shameful and shameful acts "react; it is striking but the" degree medial Manipulation "," thus the "" degree medial Manipulation "," thus the "" degree medial Manipulation "," thus the "" degree of medial manipulation, "historikerchief and a member of the National Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit to designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evils, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion in mind that for normal" "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" we are happy to go to the church, and that is a frozen frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"it also pointed out that in her youth" "strokes have been a completely normal pedagogic means" "to live with friends, as I was one was to be finished."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they are unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of misincidents often the Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"wrongly wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who talked to the" "My brother of Pope" "in 12 languages (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 rainbow-cats have been abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plurality "victims of overaccessed, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" "in summary, it is clear that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases of physical and psychic violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially at high Emotionality the punishment for the pupils could become even more vehement.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless in contrast to numerous other signs, many victims falls the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann, why the final report on the abnormalities of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the" incidents of violence against protesters at the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students stand out his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who has been tangible, when a Domspatz does not have a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate the biograph of this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you are reading the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight sites and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of the intermediary or fellow-knowledge among the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the violence of violence at the pre-school occurred outside of its effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to take it at least, learn from it too late or have taken the first hint not seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the cathedral-scratched school, on which he acted, was perceived by virtually all respondents as -" "salvation," "heaven" and "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents a very excellent witness, described him as" warm, "" sincere, "," proficient, and "understandful", "as extremely good-natured teacher, who catered the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" always encamped by grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high acionality, which also led to wreck."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only blow with chairs and bowed the keychains, but also earphones and got too freak boys in hair or ears, he himself did not complain about years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, it must be said that such guardians were widely used in the fragment period, the 1960s and the 1970s, were widely used, with parents like in teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeder methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a cosmopolitan school, a state grammar school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and nonviolence at the preschool, are the detached Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">Then you wonder whether it's not rather with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI. to do that many media just crashed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, still eager."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report relieved Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also placed some distorting or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual accesses claimed to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never sinned, with my father or mother to talk about it," said a subject of sufferers for the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem for enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are not silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they trusted not even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral manager, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student ratzingers play a role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a respondent student sulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and the respective perpetrators could have been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that there would be mature or more clear or even more clearly, as compared to their parents, internatsmanagers, trust instructors etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"this is how the report comes to the very clear result:" "that the students involved in advance and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the study."</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned is Georg Ratzinger thus acquitted of any co-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus it cannot be accused of him, not prevented or put it to the display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to connect his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately, in some cases it happened."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media was a lot of" "violence" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will look forward in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is again a abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is clean separately: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and nonviolence, we say once, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"moreover, the report comes from time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases where lad of sadisticking teachers were controlled and malignited, and among them all entails, were all found at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to have."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Domspatzenzeitung school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the way, as the most witnesses emphasize, the theme" "school" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"it was just happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment, and for many even" heavenly "conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspection School?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but there was no sadious violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims gathered the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at most still the proach, have to be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschschule."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school, where he didn't want to hear and responsible, (such a witness) had nothing to hear, and then back to 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closures Georg Ratzinger consistently the ears consistently in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzenzeitung, the report even reproduces."</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this he shows that he will continue to be practised in the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the risk of negative press coverage he recommended an urgent objection.</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time when legal clarity was, when testing was banned in Bavaria too long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, they found themselves in a legal gray area, like everyone of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was hard to cherish him where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where really the allowed border has been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one cannot say, he had always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in the year 1980 the testing was officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed it, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards for the then time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we were talking about the" "pitfalls of Anachronism", "thus the danger, past and to evaluate the present moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The Princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse that was abominous at all times and also not for what was broken down in the pre-school of adversity and violence at untrained children's population, which goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punching, thus earcher and to pull in hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment, it has been forbidden, he has also kept strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his rainy time has Georg Ratzinger, for talks with you for the book" My brother of Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the topic audited to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, relates out of his perspective, as the cathedral-cats played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not at all that he conducted a strictest regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but that has to be said once again: without this perfectionism, without the unintendent discipline, it would hardly be possible to form an institution of world-known Regensburger Domspatzen (1983 and 1987) and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1991) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone one does not make a big singer and stand before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger in the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well met and repeatedly experienced as a wonderful, humorous, angry and hearty good people from which you could not imagine that he could have only a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with how many former cathedral store still today, 23 years after its emeriority, regular contact with him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him up to today, that he once was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are today thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, patterned teacher - a hard father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect person, to which they still look up and worship them straight."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clear: everything you have pre-casts, are guardians that were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, only because it is prominent and an even more prominent brother has to make the medial sapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention that stands behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, relieved him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now, the set-up areas would have acquired a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps in Germany nobody would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
