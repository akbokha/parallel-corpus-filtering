Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston has to not always be perfect or successful .
this has made clear the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; I will always put in drawers or sit down from the outside label , who usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are more straightforward . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh it to be explained as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as it explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan &quot; .
&quot; at the most loved the act@@ ress spends her time at home , d@@ m television with lo@@ vel@@ ed Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it is in the magazine . &quot;

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyram@@ ids
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger looked for some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a horseback ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyram@@ ids &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses rec@@ alled on their evening , they said in the fast gal@@ lop home to the feeding of food . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
&quot; he allowed himself to carry with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he did not look for pictures . &quot;
this was the first time in Aachen and with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ thilfe floo@@ ded the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden pyram@@ ids .
in awards it lacks the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen led him already .
long is the 18th Award of the Sport@@ pyram@@ ids .
in Aachen he met the first prize winners of Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means a lot &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so , he also gave the prize money from 25.000 Euro to the same . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold U.S. mast was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; among the excellent include the athle@@ tic Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ asts E@@ ber@@ hard Gi@@ ve , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spring@@ ve Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand of all Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men were arrived on Saturday after Aachen .
&quot; after the official part the illustr@@ ative Society went to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger remained distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ton and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy compared : it &apos;s all about money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - you want to both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US presidential elections are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a prin@@ cipl@@ ed , more philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to pun@@ ishes the economy to death and regulate death he says .
&quot; himself on the other hand , he would be quite different , claims Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely return regulations , and he is strong for a wide tax reform with a lower tax rate - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton in contrast , says : the state has certain duties to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes would be increased for the rich , she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton almost wor@@ t@@ ate . &quot;
democratic App@@ en@@ in announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the nation@@ alistic Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ wing of the Re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; however , at Tru@@ mp you could come to internal discussions . &quot;
more evident are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and again high coal production in the USA .
oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris mi@@ tigation agreement .
&quot; in contrast , Clinton wants to expand and demand the renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ de Trade Agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate the international trade - but just to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should then also be paid better , calling about Clinton . &quot;
the present minimum wage of 7.3 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not entirely clear : once he says , the minimum wage has to r@@ ally , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand stands Tru@@ mp , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and its citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep him before , so the household defic@@ its would be even bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who would like to ask at least the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every one @-@ wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women , who alone will flee , almost already for everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women sitting .
each one has a baby to be at the most one year old .
one has laid their little son in the arm .
he gu@@ ed with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother rigid on the top @-@ top .
until they notice that she is observed .
it sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social assistance offers in Bavaria , and deals with the topic women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in Mün@@ chner north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all@@ ot@@ ted women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs established the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich &apos;s contribution .
&quot; since then , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there any - even not as visitors .
the exception is an wa@@ ist in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : any woman who arrives here , has made her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are politically persec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as a hop@@ per for Europe . &quot;
&quot; for women , other reasons for escape : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , Hon@@ or , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act , is not a r@@ arity . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells . &quot;
&quot; again , all the women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worse if ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the Munich &apos;s north , are traum@@ atis@@ ed , it appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not optional . &quot;
many women are so acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to that they have nothing to say .
&quot; or they don &apos;t trust openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not help you know , they need more accommodation only for them . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven District govern@@ s are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction area , answer some with no . &quot;
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are no such thing in the governments of the governments .
&quot; even in Schw@@ aben , women were not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , basement and medi@@ cs , there are in some common tables or own homes , only for all @-@ related women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
also the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study that was published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing or become men and women together , it can lead to - continuous violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , washing rooms should be easily accessible and accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel of this protective need , one can read at the And@@ j@@ ath who gives it to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily set up a second house .
assistance practitioners : demands for new labour @-@ fighting measures
&quot; dep@@ u@@ ties of the assist@@ ants have called their union to develop new labor measures , with their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire advice , starting from the beginning of September more working conditions . &quot;
&quot; the J@@ DC said that there had been dre@@ amed of Ministers , to address the concerns relating to the contract . &quot;
&quot; in July , assistance and medical students have agreed in July about the rejection of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; insi@@ sted calm &quot; to problems that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC committee voted on to complete the proposed new treaty and challenged the official new negotiations to all E@@ uren &apos;s concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the Schwei@@ gen of the government , the J@@ DC committee has placed a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to escal@@ ate a project @-@ running program , which begins in early September . &quot;
&quot; disputes carried out that assistant practitioners of this year are sixteen , the first total inci@@ dents in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the BM@@ A Assist@@ enz@@ aries Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election to the rejection of the agreed contractual conditions , which were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during meetings that were still prior to the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister of Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the Treaty for physicians would be introduced to England in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; Alliance of foreign parties &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to announce an official end of the eight months of ongoing war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponents in the gold @-@ pl@@ ated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in receiving , I cannot grasp the impression that Ankara wants to bring this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the towel , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles , tasted Al@@ lied and he hardly g@@ lowed heat , even for his res@@ trained conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could no longer count it .
&quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better . &quot;
&quot; the next day he described a newspaper , that Erdo@@ gan would have heard such as would never happen anything worse . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin pointed out a radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness that the President of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory speech : the shot of a Russian fighter is on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow from response to time was awake .
&quot; Putin distributed and accused Ankara , Russia in the back . &quot;
the off@@ ense was even bigger because it was committed by a supposed friend .
&quot; the Vet@@ ro@@ man will rebuild again becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months long , the state @-@ controlled media led a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once it seemed like the Turks , to blame for all the guilt . &quot;
&quot; by the serious officials , the alleg@@ ations of senior officials were that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria could have been controlled by the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state . &quot;
he has denied this veh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message sounded , that it is time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received by President Erdo@@ gan the excuse he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ceas@@ e@@ fire are clear on hand .
Erdo@@ gan requires first and foremost all the friends that he can get after spending the last month at a failed coup .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions did not hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel insurance and char@@ ter@@ ers will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late season of the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week predic@@ ted the state @-@ television , cheap fruits and vegetables , once the Turkish agr@@ arian imported again to be allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in V@@ demo@@ sti shaped it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an extra political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry to the West since it is reaction to the tried power of power as a weak answer .
&quot; in addition , the continuing co@@ ll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin will come out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey and the west . &quot;
the Russian state @-@ president won a bonus from Ankara in Ankara that he would have requested support for the elected government organs in Ankara .
&quot; this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep @-@ sitting fear of regimes . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this gl@@ it@@ tering palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one as it once described a analy@@ st once described the &quot; Alliance of foreign parties &quot; : two countries who live from the West and are badly addressed and now ign@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in spite of public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey assist with opposing pages . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both President said at the press conference , they would not even have taken this issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey avoided it clearly on a question about her differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect Dis@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey dis@@ closes the Russian Kampf@@ jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk to each other . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
&quot; according to the board of R@@ BS , the R@@ BS is said to be reduced to a back@@ stage role according to the board of the bank . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS were connected to the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself from the past eight years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; in this time , Tra@@ str@@ ate@@ gen &quot; R@@ BS is used to protect other end consumers . &quot;
they supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship at the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by until Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head@@ quarter and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ west . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for the private customer , which are more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B is becoming our investment brand and the brand that our employees will be busy , as we become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank became a global brand , R@@ BS was a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not pursue global targets but local targets . &quot;
each of these marks will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work under these marks with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be no longer continued by the Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the rewards of the various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop themselves to the bank of the brands , as we are in the interior ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the board . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very Cypri@@ ot three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these marks . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these marks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;

&quot; the three im@@ ali@@ ge winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won before on G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy about it to happen at New@@ market , because I am here for 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ ic Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori takes the blow , when he took the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection . &quot;
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a re@@ br@@ ittle career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ go@@ eth , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career development &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey der Moderne and there is no surprise that he reached this milestone reached a few before him .
&quot; it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intell@@ ect which differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans have been excited for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he would already win 6.000 profits , if he would not only be a weekend and W@@ tur@@ ni@@ et@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has suffered a winner in the UK nearly 30 years ago which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British low@@ lands for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .

&quot; three years ago he had difficulties encountered , when he returned from his six months , but he showed an impressive characteristic to de@@ fy its branches and to return to its shape . &quot;
&quot; and he has not been at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori last long ago , that he wants to continue with cont@@ ests to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ 30 years . &quot;
Russia Putin dam@@ ert Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin was un@@ expect@@ edly released his rod Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old became a special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is clear that Putin has arranged the dism@@ iss@@ al of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was Vice President since 2012 was appointed to his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his degree at the renowned State of Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , it says ( in Russian ) that he later was the protocol manager and the leader of the government . &quot;
about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government , to support your activity as heads of stat@@ ure , and checks for the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin distributed the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked for his post and I recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , claimed both men that the Stab@@ ern@@ ef returns on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
this is no one that knows .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once able to lead to as potential president , at once the Russian environmental policy should lead to great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; Ivan@@ ov &quot; &quot; it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian presidential system for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Council K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Council ( FS@@ B ) , which was appointed K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; as Putin , he called his power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most familiar . &quot;
once was believed that Ivan@@ ov came to the second term president of Russia as a third term of Putin would have rejected the Constitution .
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally to Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he was elected president three and a half years later .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ras Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four per@@ missions of the &quot; &quot; cover &quot; &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge @-@ section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 met@@ ric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 sha@@ ves . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; economic Minister K@@ eit@@ h Brown offers a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first , who went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ ras Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineers from a truly ep@@ ic measure of this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which alone were used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closures between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate work that require extremely precise tolerances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the whole bridge decks on their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks today gets a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place . &quot;
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first decision marks a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
with this fantastic project the clas@@ p is tr@@ end@@ setting high and low @-@ making .
&quot; after the installation of the last street period and its connection with the expansion of the North @-@ deck , we had to conclude the still existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by dra@@ gging of the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters in the south .
this was massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massi@@ vely , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 1 meter long is , approx . 6@@ ,000 tons weighs and at a slope of approximately 3 % to the top . &quot;
&quot; pag@@ an , as the tolerances on which the team works , tiny were tiny - on each side they beg@@ s only a few millimeters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
saving in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have to be &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; after they were thrown away from their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station took place on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in security while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around itself and placed us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the b@@ ail@@ out station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds b@@ lows the boat except their range , until we left to water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found at a Bo@@ je without lif@@ egu@@ ards . &quot;
they all came on board the coastal boat trip and were brought back to the b@@ ail@@ out station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men that were thrown into the water , have luck in@@ jured and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot engine leaves over a notation , however , this sol@@ dering the bu@@ ys of the pot offered by the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has got over these men today .
seriously hurt - man sti@@ cking to his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and hard to hurt .
&quot; as the police rus@@ hed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;

when they came into the apartment he was twice on them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was in@@ jured on the hand and in the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;

who builds Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green my : investors should become much stronger in the future in future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; next to the next meeting . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first of all it is about the question : who will actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; vice @-@ president of Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , to show up 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
the cheap apartments can also occur in the inventory .
&quot; the great defense point in the city hall is , however , as viol@@ as : &quot; how do you deal with investors , who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of dwell@@ ings are building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban construction program , which will cost millions of costs and will still be financed to incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the political groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left still wants to print runs for investors .
&quot; regardless of the , as viol@@ a , the bul@@ let itself become a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the action concept will be implemented , which will ensure additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
&quot; however , the program is not entirely wholly : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of some 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments whose support will be run over the next few years ? &quot;
only up to 2020 will be 500 apartments .
&quot; to prevent this , the plan@@ ing @-@ policy speaking at Nicole Palm , should now be bu@@ ked out @-@ up ties of the city . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , all of them would have to be thought to get back again in the pricing . &quot;
this is possible in the West city .
on one stroke will solve the problem .
for in the western city the end of the year are running .
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price list for cheap apartments . &quot;
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; for the number of social housing in the West city is dramatically increased , it is removed from the purpose of so @-@ called mixed @-@ interference . &quot;
a concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few districts there should be no more .
the Gre@@ ens therefore expect that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go to the boat . &quot;
it is concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
&quot; however , what does not mean that it can not be found yet . &quot;
&quot; Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teen@@ ager and child can no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time with it , on screens at screens , was lam@@ ented in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Po@@ k@@ em@@ on Go , it is about to get people from the sofa and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities will not be mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were first created for video games in the 1990s ( later resulting in a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of Pop@@ ular culture sank in the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
the launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
&quot; within a few days , Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players with their Smartphones are searching outside and looking for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons who can be followed by a GPS and once they were found once &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , closed to the expectation , and sp@@ rang for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person is back every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by the Washington Post recently re@@ trac@@ ed that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of re@@ followed people , each day 30 minutes train , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays a Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to enhance performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; to take 30 minutes &quot; , &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; every day actively to be &quot; &quot; sti@@ ff on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people that look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be assessed . &quot;
&quot; who drives regularly sport , reduces its chances to behave in cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful at Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that fun makes them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people are close to hunting even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ ump@@ y toys , who have to always complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
&quot; because of Po@@ k@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help people on hunting , active , f@@ itter , and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the dam
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on entire line brilliant .
and now finally Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi@@ faceted title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world from all the eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; its total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze Med@@ al for Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ ally on the pig bal@@ es during the individual multi @-@ phase children during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American maker , which wins a multi@@ faceted title and a total of the fifth , while she fes@@ ts its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke up in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment was an end .
&quot; this success presents them in the same league as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of its sport events - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ad from 1984 Mary Lou b@@ on von her said that she &apos;s &quot; the best Tur@@ ner@@ in that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting her last test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a last over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace you after having played gold and silver in the single multi @-@ phase of women in the art summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , have won . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while on the f@@ arewell party that was re@@ tired in retirement team coordin@@ ator in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a sign @-@ sign . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long path to the top , never to have the future planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of its soil exercises - which contain its typical tum@@ bling passport - is matched to Latin American music which would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and adopted by coach A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing in the gym , was established in Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has been no more lost since the summer of 2013 , a strainer that will last as long as it wants Bil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina were easily led by two kno@@ bs , dec@@ ep@@ ed the picture . &quot;
Schwe@@ be@@ amed and Bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship .
she went back again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig and sat down with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently when she was expecting her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears currents on Bil@@ es blue , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision , which once was described in their collection @-@ book , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the power of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year &apos;s team were called &quot; &quot; gran@@ ny &quot; , &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; gran@@ ny &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercise , they bow@@ ed the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ alls , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes doub@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; what it affects , so the rapidly spread T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old took a whole new meaning at the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial production by music @-@ listening in the car
&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the deadly attacks since one decade in the first series of production of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked at a dri@@ v@@ eway , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator dam@@ p eight shots from a fire@@ wall weapon , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is in the report to read . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y @-@ all , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2.@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at it , whether it is associated with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , predominantly in H@@ isp@@ anic dwell@@ ings were killed in nine months in nine attacks and two more in@@ jured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , divided Howard of the K@@ HP@@ O , an affiliate of CB@@ S , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles used , including a brown ch@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to set the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Male@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness shared the police with that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was deduc@@ ted on an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder and the thought that it was the work of mass murder . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen , and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the motor area . &quot;
mother of a 6 @-@ year old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his retirement has Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy did not know . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought , I managed not . &quot;
I do not create that .
after that I did not let myself .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has left on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund can never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they pret@@ end to institu@@ tion@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit or sit down to his third year and he can still not speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
he can run and ride cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the character language , the Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something before &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring it strings with , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to CB@@ S News . &quot;
but there is no typical string -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as Mas@@ ern or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect life with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional prize of an un@@ certain future .
&quot; I wondered , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and they still do not know it really .
&quot; I have no longer asked for the progn@@ osis for a long time , because I do not expect to really tell me anyone . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eless rating for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth damage caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it becomes better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; fierce rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ ments in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi
fierce rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana took the governor to rest on Friday the emergency . there will be the whole Saturday above with more rainf@@ all .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the A@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded its shores , and dro@@ w@@ ned with large @-@ scale floods in extreme rainf@@ all , the National Wetter@@ dienst . &quot;
&quot; the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Ed@@ wards shared with that government offices are in constant contact with local authorities and who are already on the way to the affected communities . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ des of the Govern@@ ors , shared with that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said , that alone the community of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a thousand sand@@ bags would have requested . &quot;
a floo@@ ding system will be used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather permits for@@ ged that in this area could add additional 3 to 5 inches to rain .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas , on Friday a floo@@ d@@ breakfast system was used , while in the area Mobile continues to rain . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ites near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , all probability will achieve record levels of the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a serious floods in Ascension is a danger , because these streams flow only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river ti@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi River in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; b@@ ail@@ out team still leaves people out of the floo@@ ding in the district Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson , in the southwest of Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his boots found themselves among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually located more than 400 feet from his house , over night strongly . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step @-@ man who lives near , warned . &quot;
&quot; we are awakened and the water flowing and poured in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived there in the 48 years in which she had never seen such a plateau of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities , and he would be the one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck , and they had brought them to the next fire@@ guard in Glo@@ ster where they were up to the Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floods had spread rapidly &quot; rapidly , since there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that authorities should consider evac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been considerably reinforced by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
&quot; the authorities gave that heavy rainf@@ alls and street floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a par@@ ish and school @-@ loss in five school @-@ sections . &quot;
the CB@@ S @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an enclosed in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 floo@@ ded houses ang@@ ab .
the inhabitants were evac@@ u@@ ated in two churches that were now floo@@ ded .
&quot; the res@@ isti@@ er of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were 72 people and seven pets were saved , which were flus@@ hed from the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , not@@ aries were furnished to accomo@@ date the evac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the community of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two twi@@ light streets were closed due to the flood and sand bags for the residents who hope to hold the water out of their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big floo@@ ding we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
&quot; in the pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continues to rain on the gul@@ f coast . &quot;
according to his details a handful of houses were reported on Thursday as floo@@ ded but on Friday they have not been reported .
&quot; K@@ eit@@ h Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I saw water in places where I have never seen before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; von balls perme@@ ates , &quot; survived shal@@ e in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police share with that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week was already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grandparents of the boy identified him for CB@@ S Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grandparents announced that Brown had suffered several sh@@ utter injuries , including in the lungs , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at his transport to the hospital at consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has done much , his little body was ho@@ oked by balls , shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z the transmitter . &quot;
I cannot believe this .
the state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boys of the boys divided the transmitter with that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in Ger@@ m@@ ant@@ own .
also three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to CB@@ S Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical condition , fin@@ ed to the transmitter . &quot;
&quot; the other two victims were not found in the car and the police have been determined , whether under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
investig@@ ators shared CB@@ S Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a crus@@ fire between multiple sho@@ oters .
&quot; cartridge sle@@ eves for pet@@ rels , which were trac@@ ed to various pet@@ rels , covered the scene . &quot;
it seems that there was clearly a continual battle against this .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the wal@@ k@@ way , sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have given here several armed fighters who were very active involved , shared police ne@@ al p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
&quot; there came to no arrest , and the police currently reviews reports according to the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year girl was hit by a Quer@@ w@@ ger at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ i and Lau@@ rie you need
that is what I present to me under the women &apos;s Olympic Games and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly , this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspir@@ es many young girls of other skin @-@ color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ lich , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lic@@ in is round , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has paved the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one among the female gymn@@ as@@ ons a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic @-@ winning and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she un@@ expected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americans , who won gold at an individual multi@@ stage event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are witness@@ ing the tip of this sport , but so they do not see turn@@ around in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie smote all the same route as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic Team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will have only four gymn@@ ast within the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like turbul@@ ence is a more expensive sport and turbines primarily in private trainers who are maintained by parents , which costs for the training , furnishings , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their turbines and families ) . the list can be continued as desired . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs who can support business .
&quot; in these verses , the Tur@@ ner receive its whole training and that is for the families a expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes , since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we have to get inspired to the municipalities of inn@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , allow a high @-@ performance and easy accessible turn@@ around . &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ inc@@ it@@ ement of 20 years .
&quot; with my events , we have provided free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) , and trained national and international conqu@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality Tur@@ ns , offering the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olymp@@ ic sport . &quot;
&quot; turbines developed strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers li@@ fel@@ ong advantages for health as well as for educational and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , that thousands of young girls take care of interest to the gymn@@ ast , and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ i and Ma@@ dison , for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the olymp@@ ic team and thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different background motiv@@ ating their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assist@@ ants would like to organize further strikes after they have rejected H@@ Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes caused by adopting a reform@@ ist contract with the functions of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 3@@ 7@@ ,000 assist@@ ants who were voting in a choice . &quot;
&quot; in July he had unveil@@ ed plans to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , the changes to night and weekend work , in order to improve the care for uneven clo@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; DR cubits Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Com@@ ple@@ a Committee for Assist@@ enz@@ aries shared the last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance physicians have led to the proposed contract in particular concerns , in particular that it will satisfy the current staff crisis and prepare it to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; for just eight weeks , which still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty , must be made progress and the time is going out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve dispute through interviews with government on the sake of re@@ vocation and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened of a promise , that Jerem@@ y Hunt had made it last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hunt has to act now to up@@ lift the penetration and address the worries of assist@@ ants .
&quot; if he does not do this , so the assist@@ ants made clear that they are prepared to carry out further working conditions . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to grant physicians on the strike @-@ post coverage . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes caused by adopting the reform@@ ism with the functions of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants to be a better week@@ day remun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants , which will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employee , called for assistance to quit the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working conditions do not achieve anything of only little , but already strain teams and service providers and prepare the patient , peac@@ ock , and their families only concerns , poverty and interruption . &quot;
&quot; during the last two months we have spoken to the Comintern executive committee , and with the Ministry of Health , as well as other ministries positively responded positively to concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - how to return , flexibility in training , training courses for those who were from a vocational training period , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training courses and the health Department concerning the observance of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart attack
&quot; thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after being recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time . &quot;
the prescribed medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke if or another heart attack is reduced . &quot;
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has a four years of intake recommended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has a four years of intake recommended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stroke are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arter@@ ial walls .
&quot; if the Bel@@ ag breaks apart , it can cause a blood circulation that causes blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood@@ stream dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood flow and co@@ vert the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is driven under the commercial name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood vessels un@@ probable . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation of N@@ ICE , which was released today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Caro@@ le Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE Health Training Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary invention , a quarter of all persons have suffered a heart attack , a heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attack and stroke are already a heart attack .
&quot; due to the preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it . &quot;
the information about the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the assignment of the Board recommends no treatment that hin@@ ge over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tifi@@ es can flour@@ ish in Muslim regions
&quot; the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ein Rah@@ man was last year on the release of a government report , because of corruption from the office . &quot;
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tifi@@ es has resulted in that widespread election in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a crus@@ hing governmental report today revealed .
&quot; the former cabinet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , electoral and Rath@@ eg@@ ro@@ wers to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to Eth@@ nie and Religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , who is now a Ant@@ arctic , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters made from religious moti@@ fs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set out tri@@ bul@@ ations outside of electoral cabins , to protect the voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a passport with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at the moment , a vot@@ er must name only his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , non @-@ sensitive ink applied to the finger of a person if they give their vote to prevent that someone chooses twice . &quot;
whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to common documents and decisions by no official comm@@ uni@@ tion@@ aries or work@@ groups .
&quot; this not only serves against election , but should also protect the municipal government before the broader corruption and finance culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign than in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court decided that the official mayor of Lut@@ for Rah@@ man came to cor@@ rupted to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court found that Rah@@ man could be per@@ ated by the religious feelings of its Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way , and that he had brought his critics to the silence of r@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis , that it is the relative duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of a im@@ itation , in which a person sel@@ ects someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fraud throughout the country .
he vo@@ iced in particular alar@@ ming about frau@@ dul@@ ent tor@@ ing - when older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including filling out to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; proof was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , particularly women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pakistan or ban@@ ana background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity to ethnic never and religion would not know@@ ingly ignored .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists need to edit &quot; &quot; vote &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report that is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tougher registration tests to prevent the electoral directory to Im@@ mig@@ rations and soci@@ al@@ ges@@ tions . &quot;
consider options to ask voters prior to choosing your ID .
&quot; not removable ink on the finger of a person , once they released their voice to prevent that someone chooses twice . &quot;
perform systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are authentic@@ ated .
a three @-@ year limitation on requests for an automatic post@@ code .
ban that political activists are able to process full brie@@ fing and envel@@ opes of brie@@ fing .
&quot; the police will give the authority , shut @-@ off for choice of choice . &quot;
a legislative change which facilitates an indictment for intim@@ id@@ ation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( Pop@@ ular Law 1983 ) .
photography @-@ offered in multi @-@ gy@@ ms .
request that only English can be used in the election stations ( except for Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure that the employees are usually able to assert that voters alone go into the cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &apos; amazing that after the Tower Ham@@ lets have no pen@@ alties .
&quot; the constitu@@ ent Tribunal has l@@ ut@@ ein for Rah@@ man and his substitute for a corrupt and illegal practices described as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was guilty of criminal proceedings - according to the stringent requirements of criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critici@@ zed the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; of the European registration departments .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is carrying out as the mother of the parliaments , a proud heritage , but the worrying and covered propag@@ ation of constitu@@ encies , and rej@@ ecting some authorities are threatening this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger by Olympi@@ ans in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are this week about the French bicycle sports@@ men Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of the edge and band that has proved to be impressive Doppel@@ gänger in the Duke of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one , the Gold fought Ath@@ let , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if you should give the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which currently creates on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ ad that have more than just a certain similarity with Holl@@ y@@ ang most famous . &quot;
&quot; the hunters and the Wolf : cre@@ w@@ member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since childhood . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger in the cycle track , many people on the internet pointed out how to be a certain ar@@ cher of the Gem@@ ini @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has a storm on Twitter , after pictures where he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secre@@ tly . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in social media with and gave to that he has been able to hear since his childhood he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see a great similarity with the exception of the facial hair , shared Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ seeing guy , so I do this as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be at the center : the brilliant similarity between the British vast@@ ly Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes should go through a Doppel@@ gänger in for the Cub@@ an American singer of Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh compared to the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
&quot; one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot;
a further prolonged comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nice who has similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver medals in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the son@@ nen@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan Adrian von fans was att@@ ested with an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the one : a Twitter @-@ user was very happy about that other similarities have also fallen
&quot; put theory into the room : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the similarity of the couple perhaps a reason . &quot;
&quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact the US @-@ football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons recorded Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal in the tower Gab@@ by Douglas , who has its own beautiful , big smile , that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle . &quot;

&quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off , when he wants to abandon his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ est@@ l@@ ame staff@@ el . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald , who was picked up into the comment@@ ator of Bal@@ S on board to give more &quot; &quot; color &quot; , &quot; you could hear &quot; &quot; these little 14 @-@ year @-@ old China has lost the affili@@ ation , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , went from like mad , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .

viewers soon re@@ acted online after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and the language
&quot; Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ er twe@@ ete , &quot; Hat the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year s@@ wimm@@ ers in China &quot; like a pig ? ? ? ? ? ? &quot;
&quot; the idi@@ ot has not broken , that they were still on show . &quot;
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m Fre@@ isti@@ l@@ sch@@ crowded staff@@ el for women as follows : &quot; these small 14 @-@ year @-@ old China has lost the affili@@ ation , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , where there were many questions concerning him . &quot;
Twitter @-@ User didn &apos;t get back when they heard how uns@@ ensi@@ bel By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in Sarah &apos;s wrote : &quot; Wo@@ w , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you re@@ present the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like R@@ assi@@ sten . # ange@@ elt .
&quot; short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was aired by a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was a unhappy selected formulation , it is sorry that it is happening . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BC exc@@ elled at the end of more than 90 times in the people , who have responded to the spot@@ ted on Twitter &quot;
the comment@@ ator @-@ colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on behalf of Mac@@ Donald
&quot; C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users , which had worth the comments of Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
the network also exc@@ used quickly and gave a message out .
&quot; we regret it sincerely , that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast it . &quot;
we used to exc@@ used yesterday evening by our viewers on the broadcast and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in social media .
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ ons comments related to the services of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were un@@ adequate and a unhappy chosen phrase . By@@ ron does that which he has said , very dress . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment for me to make myself for the comment , which I have done after women &apos;s cre@@ eping staff@@ el in the C@@ BC Olympic stadium , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have paid me on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , there was no cont@@ emp@@ t intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ tied on women who tried in the middle of the shop under@@ wear under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where they should see , when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try sub@@ p@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , they numbered them , as she saw it , she moved out and laid them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she continues and tasted four pairs of sub@@ p@@ ants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone . &quot;
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ p@@ ants before they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who found himself at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear and left the business without buying something . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales surface , she took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the output , moved their own whirlpool and p@@ ants from and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a little discrete place to do it - it was just there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each star@@ red , when they returned to the under@@ p@@ ants who obviously did not like it , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before they finally decided that you fell nothing but went and out .
she did not seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or about the person who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants who tried them .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; As contradic@@ tory to think that someone else had an@@ oses with home , who had another person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I got involved , the staff tried to pull the clothing items from the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants to find out that another woman had them and returned and they were not washed .
&quot; one speaker from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is to be aware of the event that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before ceas@@ ing arms
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him something safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ Federation in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers in the near distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn to your pre@@ dat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; when you turn to you from behind , then you should turn to be a first turn , so that you can see your att@@ acker and move from the Sch@@ uss@@ line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the gun then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow to the face .
&quot; then hit him with the knee in the ly@@ re and rot@@ ate , while the att@@ acker stir@@ red off sor@@ eness , the weapon from his hands . strike it down with the running into the face and move back@@ wards while she put the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers which approach itself from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shaft , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , you can shift the weight onto the gun and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle before they move back@@ wards and turn the weapon to him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
take a look at the video to see exactly how it does Miz@@ ra@@ chi advance .
&quot; but remember that it is the safest , to exceed your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
rice Ian W@@ right sc@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide to the most famous places of Europe
a bri@@ tish trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and throws in a serious examination - by reading some of the most nar@@ ro@@ wer and ek@@ el@@ dest places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel editor Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k wi@@ ped his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a flush on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush with a draw base , as well as a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance ability of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; in front of the check @-@ in each object , he used to show a L@@ umin@@ ometer for himself and to show us what he will let itself . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , brought some surprising results of daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought to reject the flush kno@@ b of a draw base , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually are in a kitchen sul@@ try more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria , as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately left nothing , what he read , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine , by the world traveled and peculi@@ ar as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to rail stations to the flush of res@@ tro@@ oms , the task presented its immune system definitely below a sample &quot;
&quot; he told me : &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in the film he was able to cater to his reputation in any case .
&quot; the only thing he did , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;

&quot; Mr W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of persons in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I put in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will find nothing here because there is in@@ doors here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ d .
&quot; the company features Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intest@@ ine bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ d Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumers really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to view and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we led crazy bra@@ in@@ stor@@ m@@ ings , which ended we said &quot; &quot; Come to us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer with more information in an interesting way .
also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , added : &quot; I have lost me so - I could have had my respect for Ian , if he would have noticed some of the things I have reli@@ eved him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ective Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to them , they pun@@ ching and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad we received some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey carried out from the year 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents made in l@@ actic acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they are used at least occasionally products , the attached l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
A@@ social family destro@@ ys before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ing social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social structure after a delay with a damage to a height of £ 50,000 because it had spread their neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash . Corn@@ wall .
&quot; after they had res@@ trained their property removed from their property , sho@@ cked the property staff were property in a mis@@ par@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls were cris@@ p holes on wood di@@ pl@@ anks , rub@@ b@@ umps were scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was reduced to the walls . &quot;
the family have been fenced and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the household management at Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing , said that they feared that the apartment is no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property will probably be regarded as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is in@@ famous and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had attached , street struggles with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ets , intim@@ id@@ ated by residents , drug abuse , drug @-@ trading and excessive scre@@ aming , stretching and fluid . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was stood on the lease , got an order for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which under circumstances will be demol@@ ished , old trash was found . &quot;
they were tra@@ ded in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past drugs
neighbours said they saw her on the road and regularly had to inv@@ oked the police .
&quot; Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing del@@ o@@ gi@@ ed her and her partner this week res@@ trained by the estate , after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntary sur@@ fers . &quot;
&quot; the dolphins have been acc@@ laimed by ligh@@ tened neighbors , saying that their life was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; They sh@@ aded not anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing , said that it failed to join the family with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police were called regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the over@@ looked side of the community were thrown rub@@ b@@ ish rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it dre@@ amed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and the family because a del@@ usion is always the last step that Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing will take into consideration . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely and their actions had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have gr@@ aceful to us and have given us the information we have made . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development is con@@ sol@@ dered to some neighbours and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ing on the ground
&quot; the workers of the house administration will now have to make mar@@ ches , which surround the house . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ nia and cash at the amount of £ 1.@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; skel@@ eton received a money sentence , having been guilty of the possessions of a threat of class B in trade . &quot;
&quot; they claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don is , who died in 2013 at a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and its partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms of the house were summ@@ ed with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police say that they will serve as a ten@@ ant , which will not stick to the house order . &quot;
Angela C@@ row shared by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ vers had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the property .
&quot; this goes to those who can think that they can accept themselves without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who have been damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior , who continue to cooperate with partners in order to protect our communities . &quot;

bronze went to the Japanese Jun@@ mist@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the end@@ game and made the title among each other .
so it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would bring the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia @-@ staircase was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sets and at Time @-@ outs , they had no co@@ aches with you . &quot;
they sat down on the grand@@ stand and left their tren@@ ches at the fair competition alone each other .
&quot; the sailors until here have I played for my land . &quot;
&quot; in the finals I play for me , &quot; had said Z@@ hang fol@@ ly . &quot;

Donald Tru@@ mp Sp@@ t ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US Re@@ public@@ ans will also be pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , also in traditionally conservative states to turn their majority . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; presidential @-@ did@@ ate Donald Tru@@ mp now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg U@@ tah . &quot;
&quot; a rare moment in which the usually magn@@ anim@@ ate and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire , something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after he threw 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , the doubt of his success in the struggle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp ahead of evangel@@ ic Christians , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilt were false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ sch@@ ist w@@ ack@@ able
U@@ tah is normally a secure bank for re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; a survey of Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , according to Tru@@ mp and his competitor of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , is equal . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance , which are common for re@@ publi@@ can candidates in the state state . &quot;
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp rep@@ lied to the question as he wants to stop the advance Clin@@ ton : &quot; &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make nothing else than telling the truth .
&quot; if it does not lie for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to Press@@ eb@@ erg@@ es , the party of Tru@@ mp should be threatened with funds to support his electoral scale , it should not be able to present a better re@@ demand . &quot;
instead of making the candidates of the Re@@ public@@ ans for the congress more strongly under the arms .

the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arctic mission to the case .
K@@ eni@@ as L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ l@@ eten threat@@ ens the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud @-@ attempt at a mental control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee dealt with as promptly a discipl@@ in@@ ean mission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan &apos;s official had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and present @-@ day coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the Team@@ line K@@ eni@@ ans from the doping control .
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C in order to obtain information about the case in order to have their own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , it was in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the intelligence control station and turned out as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; declared K@@ eni@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ credi@@ tation of athletes on the list for the training control of the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup @-@ fourth over 800 meters .
four days prior to the Ken@@ yan L@@ ights of deleg@@ ate Michael Rot@@ ich had been dra@@ gged from the Rio Olympics .
he is supposed to be informed against cash payments in his country about pending mental tests .
&quot; according to his return , he should be arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has been under the IO@@ C according to numerous mental doping since a long time under particular observation .
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 intelligence controls before the Rio Olympics , we noticed that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into sight . &quot;
&quot; the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ doping law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before Olympics .
&quot; in the episode , W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of countries whose mental to fight against the rules of W@@ ada . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the land won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports the ARD has always been raised again , that in Kenya &apos;s funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sport fraud . &quot;
IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar study in Kenya as he had placed them in the Russian athle@@ tics .
thereby it could be proven that in this sport @-@ wide and systematic opt @-@ powered .
Russia &apos;s L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ l@@ eten were then excluded from the summer .

&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presented the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a Musi@@ cal conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ or@@ n@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and filled with the role of Mary a youth mare .
in the orchest@@ ral the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix that is the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have am@@ ber music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Lady .
she re@@ members with melanchol@@ y to her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first of all because she is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then as Mary &apos;s personality would be .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel , oh so , I feel great and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course nai@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character , which I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of Lob@@ ith for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enormously rich man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is as an extraordinary artist and very passion@@ ately !
rigi@@ dly is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American film@@ maker Philip World Cup . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; in this piece , it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; today we have gone the refugees , at that time the pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans had gone to New York , and the New York residents did not want it . &quot;
&quot; they are the same issues , and they are just as powerful today as it was at that time . &quot;
59 years later the play is still relevant .

&quot; SU@@ L@@ TA@@ NA was 17 years old , and died shortly after her family after her family , to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; you can only hope that the only good is in it - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it , to stop in a war area - to stop people ever to make this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , SU@@ L@@ TA@@ NA and two other school gather@@ ings come from the east of London in an airplane towards Turkey , and subsequently into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;

the Kur@@ dish community of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of people who fled from Turkey to Germany in short notice .
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the Sch@@ and@@ est@@ rian Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the tough advance of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community is expecting a mass cur@@ sed by Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with ten thousand people in the long term , in the long term , with a few hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany , when Erdo@@ gan regimes continue fighting for minorities and democratic opposition &quot; , &quot; says the association &apos;s leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; from Friday . &quot;

after the sealed coup are still exposed to sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ists the ethnic Turks .
many are going to restart in Europe if they are further suppres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , which itself takes refugees , produced in their own country of refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the ex@@ chan@@ g@@ ous compl@@ ett@@ ling the targeted settlement of sy@@ r@@ ischer Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
that Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the ex@@ iting of Erdo@@ gan to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ and@@ ef demanded that the German government positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its adher@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in Germany there is a &quot; wit@@ t hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany during the last few months .
the German branch of the quality movement feared also the flight of many Turks .

&quot; at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has decided not again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because of so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ day battle - that is enclosed . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the campaigns are on holiday .
&quot; most holi@@ day@@ makers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so may not choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; these include practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters up@@ ases , ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ akes , and count toward the end of the voices , only lab@@ ori@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and last Feri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass once again for an election close to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win cel@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting , how strongly Neul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition . &quot;
&quot; cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive electoral campaign , one sees from his grand@@ stand . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , spread s@@ ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , just as it did his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
otherwise the col@@ ering will get cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame on the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the right @-@ op@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its leading channel data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when looking at the wrong time at the right place for election campaign . &quot;
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large reference ; Merkel Chancellor Par@@ sw@@ ahl@@ o is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as a Mecklenburg en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it also seems to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U has largely om@@ itted to the usual electoral hub on market places and before m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , so says Kok@@ ert , play only a &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has noted that you are br@@ ittle to the country the basis , that it has to be very strict again to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you will find it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the streets of the country there is hardly any present . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election Kok@@ ert to his collaborators , however , is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; you have to go then where it is doing , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , cel@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last updated by 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had yet made clear with 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small Party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , are likely to create the leap into the land day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and put their election campaign in the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; calls it the President Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green electoral campa@@ ign@@ ers go to Sp@@ ur@@ en@@ search for native stim@@ uli among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the leading can@@ did@@ ine , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ bur@@ ial lakes and still finds it beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 renovation : guest houses suffer from blocking
&quot; with the speed , with which the B 27 is gentle , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for construction works which begin at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning , and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the Jet @-@ Gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
&quot; the construction site could be moved to the south beginning to the mid @-@ season as scheduled after the end of October , until the end of October will be all finished . &quot;
&quot; the dism@@ iss@@ ors will also be praised for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of re@@ vocation tours . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to south and also the block@@ age of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ nia has been lifted , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been restored , the traffic situation in the place has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now run by O@@ f@@ ter@@ nia from the B 27 again .
the lack of transport through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; says the responsible management of the restructuring responsibility for the executive director of Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ k@@ ach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sc@@ ams searched and more likely to be familiar with their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to man@@ cher trucks in residential areas .
the speed b@@ umps are not observed also called for the assembly to sing the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were considerable crossing , &quot; says King , who made himself a place on the spot . &quot;
two or three per minute have been lit@@ ur@@ red .
the quick@@ est was with 77 kilometers per hour in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site , however , it has become more quiet . &quot;
&quot; for business@@ men at the B 27 there is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the road is now open again . &quot;
business@@ men do not hesitate to look at the cards .
&quot; however , that the B 27 renov@@ ations has led to wag@@ er@@ brü@@ chen , everyone who asks the man to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some have been affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for whom the refurb@@ ishment has no consequences . &quot;
&quot; Mai@@ er Mai@@ er speaks Thomas Sul@@ z from a &quot; &quot; most light drop &quot; , &quot; but also one that is naturally missing . &quot;
most exploited are the local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential @-@ threatening .
&quot; not only him , but all the speakers have made it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it l@@ acked the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we must be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; the sales revenue is based on &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stre@@ at@@ ment took its operations &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to release it .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , politics would have been different . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there might be a financial compensation , the guest house benef@@ ited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 Now now they also need the disadvantages , which arise through the renov@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something was handled with funding . &quot;
&quot; in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family run has been located since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now subject to the complicated traffic of traffic less frequently , it can be understood . &quot;
&quot; if one can not drive , it is also somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; that his tri@@ ggers are returning again after the end of renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 @-@ construction work on its customers for the greatest crisis which has experienced its guest house in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
six months of construction work is already brutal .
&quot; constantly , in the name of the terrorist fight against laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick@@ ened security package . &quot;
but what does it have to do with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Recon@@ c@@ iler .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Minister for the presentation of his new safety package . &quot;
they do not ask anyone .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
also in this part I am part of me .
&quot; however , as Interior Minister , he was placed on results and at a &quot; reco@@ ver@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach leave a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but they all fall for this now the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced that a new security authority should take care of the b@@ aking encrypted communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU targets on passenger &apos;s data and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the safety authorities is not surprising .
&quot; in part de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , the SPD will not start to make a second place for suggestions with the SPD : he wants to make sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment , and jihadists with double citizenship in the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , he still consider this for reasonable and demands no chances of what the codi@@ le partner have no chances . &quot;
some new ideas will be presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they are in part in itself : he plans quick to de@@ port@@ ations and more opportunities to det@@ ecting people before deportation .
refugees that are specifically fet@@ ched into the country before they release their smartphone and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; for ex@@ ul@@ sions for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse still worse than until now - for example those who commit crimes or their pap@@ er@@ ers to be aware of their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legally pag@@ an .
man@@ tras also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of memorial for example - raises the question : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; but it cannot be said in paragraphs , that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many people are worried about the high refugee deal concerns the security . &quot;
&quot; and things that are deeply employed people , now they did not stand out in election times . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous into the focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ locking is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral campaigns . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU and SPD can therefore increasingly move into position on the issue of internal security . &quot;
in the past few days there went high between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ den@@ ger dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security @-@ policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior , in which the resort is also a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also turns here to conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; of a return from the double pass , he is nothing . &quot;
we have the discussion in Germany .
to restart it is not useful .
and in a Bur@@ ka ban he had constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ ent to all corners and if it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co @-@ operation partner , you have to show up until now . &quot;
there is some things in what could make for dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to gain inner security during the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes only with caution and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , to contribute to improving the security . &quot;
even Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ p comes from .
despite diesel @-@ sc@@ and@@ als the pay@@ ers are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs around .
in the back @-@ up campaign there is vor@@ tex for a term .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; in the past year of Europe , the largest motor@@ homes can continue in the course of the year despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW mainly weak@@ ened in Western Europe and thus continuing the total sales , as the company launched in the D@@ ax company . &quot;
the brands sold around the world sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less than in the previous year .
&quot; in Western Europe alone , in China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s months . &quot;
in the homeland market Germany s@@ ack@@ ed the ou@@ ghts around almost one six@@ fold .
bran@@ ding Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought the weak@@ est numbers from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it has been given a res@@ tra@@ int in some core markets by &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup trial in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um was deb@@ ated to the resign@@ ation of the EU , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gas were first escal@@ ated , there is also further a minus . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the chie@@ fly property of Lower Saxony goes on even further through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months is only a supplier minus from 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
consolidated Fred Kap@@ pler was able to proceed to a sales department from January to July .
&quot; 1.9 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , around 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had t@@ amper@@ ed with a software subscription .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW alone calls for some 2.5 million cars for re@@ armament to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion of vehicles it does not give fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power no deterioration . &quot;
&quot; the motor@@ homes present the customer after the conversion a &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , &quot; but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the basis of legal consistency .
&quot; focus &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted his German customers now a guarantee for a sc@@ aff@@ able diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
the Department of Foreign Affairs was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has to fulfill the conditions of my investig@@ ative Commission , and the KBA full . &quot;
&quot; deviations of these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output after the modification does not take place deterior@@ ations and all type @-@ approved vehicle values unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guar@@ ant@@ y &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; , Volkswagen is the possibility that customers arrive for example a half year after conversion to a workshop , and this can lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in customer interest , it is important to avoid any damage caused by any other damage that com@@ prise nothing to do with the sc@@ andal in terms of possible warran@@ ties as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savings in future pen@@ cin@@ ations - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; Bank President Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; It is just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case , and does not see a signal : normal austerity would have to be &quot; not afraid to pay for their austerity policies . &quot;
&quot; bearings banks pay money by night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits on 100,000 Euro to Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
he has been around 40 million euros since a day that could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not fail .
&quot; these lie with me on the bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lie for any million 4,000 Euros . &quot;
he will now give the costs after the susp@@ end principle .
&quot; the cash just lie in the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; I have experienced four over@@ nights , I &apos;m not still the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
most of the customers could have understanding and dis@@ regard to other investment forms .
only few hi@@ ked to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association in Bavaria , &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear only , be &quot; &quot; economical permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for bank account , credit cards or credit transfers . &quot;
with criminal in@@ soles of three million euros by the Thur@@ in@@ gian Parliament and the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Country with its Skat@@ bank branch 2014 Head@@ lines made .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leaders of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay nationwide dischar@@ ged for deposits , this is a lot too strong in Germany under banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see give it &quot; a cliff , which is equipped from the property a little lav@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; this can be a small bank for a problem , if they charge for free . &quot;
&quot; the Z@@ ossen@@ schaft bank G@@ mund founded two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , renowned actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative @-@ association Bayern &quot; are currently no further banks known , which comp@@ ute a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said Ms Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German folk banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ b@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the threshold into neg@@ atives with the private customers , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition is hard , and it thre@@ aten the migration from investors to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not let themselves fallen in width .
destination plates : who does not buy sound plates ?
lonely men aged middle @-@ age love plates .
&quot; before you commit to the commentary box , to over@@ so@@ w him under the pseudon@@ ym of non @-@ all@@ ot@@ ting men with harsh ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ licity of sound plates do not want to be to an boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the re@@ unification of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
&quot; those who have recently bought a record , all predic@@ tions are between 45 and 54 . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older cab@@ aret retain their feelings rather for himself ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoying it to spend their own time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a modest gray approach , and wild , before I ste@@ al , my hands hold and something like this : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart So@@ hos is slow down to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now re@@ plen@@ ished the buildings where once independent seller were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic turn@@ out stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the camera to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess her age and vegetables through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I followed by Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three men aged middle age ) into the Rec@@ klin@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age ) , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I already treasure , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels . &quot;
&quot; this record , pictured ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I am not followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of its available income : it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and other items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60@@ s , early 70@@ s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who are buying plates , are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend their own time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my push .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 who works at Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers who meets he meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard from the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and to be prompted to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; by the talks I have led , people usually have been doing so about 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; says he . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores a soothing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took impetus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some plate fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull themselves back to the stability of familiar sound disks , of objects , the bl@@ iss@@ ful Ju@@ gen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of sol@@ ace , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
that is with me as a collector and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; one employee of a record stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people , the last month bought a record , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey took also out that 41 % possess a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who purchase a record , do not have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the message I would probably look very concerned , while I was pet@@ alled by a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova complic@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works in sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men aged by middle age ) , has noticed one &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the cage . &quot;
&quot; someone only arrived here recently and said , &quot; I do not own a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ plate , so that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
&quot; more productive , less music @-@ sharp . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who are slow to come . &quot;
&quot; lop that has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the photos make teen@@ ager and women aged middle age . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er- and sex@@ ist Pop instead of experimental jazz from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks dou@@ bt@@ ful , but na@@ ecological psychological trau@@ mas are hard to be as@@ cer@@ tained if one is standing next to someone over 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around for several minutes in the shop and looked at the vari@@ ance of the available plates . &quot;
it rather makes a man@@ or@@ tal than a large one .
&quot; she does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from one computer or another way , but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a dear@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said that a new generation of bike lovers is said : urban Out@@ f@@ itters .
&quot; while I give the voucher to mut@@ ing the je@@ ans hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teenagers , which for a moment to ask for Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter should be superior to buy one cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some are so far above that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , even the one that is most suitable for luxury items like records . &quot;

French dish re@@ jects offering about demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; in a court ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Calais that the state should be fu@@ elled to sell 72 improvis@@ ation stores in which individuals outside the camp goods , from cigarettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ sers or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Calais argu@@ ed that these places should be lower , because they would be a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid , and that a fire@@ - and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported union and other groups are not enough food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led out that provisional stores and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the assignment of people who run the 72 provisional shops , but sp@@ elled that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Calais will be absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to live people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of calm meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the fall was the young Book kids &apos; Café of the camp , the community @-@ sel@@ fish , and 200 meals a day , English and French @-@ classes as well as providing advice to asylum seekers for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closing &quot; for this children of a catastrophe would be , of which the most recent eight years are old . &quot;

Group rises at start @-@ up for live video transmis@@ sions
&quot; looking at other people playing video games , is a Ries@@ ling - this will also benefit from Microsoft . &quot;
the technology group purchases the start @-@ up Be@@ am that specializes in this hobby .
&quot; how much money is running for the acquisition , Microsoft does not share with it on Thursday . &quot;
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer in January and has already more than 100.000 users .
&quot; you can look at other games , but also intervene . &quot;
&quot; for example , they can give up to players missions and provide enemies and provide devices . &quot;
the fre@@ eri@@ ese Activ@@ ation Bli@@ zz@@ ard starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to global media event it should help Facebook .
the advertising industry is already looking forward to .
&quot; the employees of the start @-@ ups which has its seat until now in Seattle in the US state of Washington , moved to the Microsoft office in Califor@@ ni@@ an Red@@ mond around , like Be@@ am co @-@ founder and Chief Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i . &quot;
for the customer therefore it is intended to change anything through the acquisition .
&quot; according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated in the Video Cloud Department around the Xbox console . &quot;
the market of the live stream of video activities is currently growing rapidly .
known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
T@@ witch was bought from the online shop in 2014 - for nearly a billion dollars .
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother alpha@@ bet .
here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany Ras@@ he has to adapt to the next generation of speed measurements : in various Bundes@@ länder , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , the tem@@ pos@@ ing is especially effective . &quot;
the futur@@ istic effective endo@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for instance at random score where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rest@@ art@@ ed bridges with temporary temperature @-@ pin with there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary aper@@ ture for observing the speed limit . &quot;
a lasting mobile structure can however be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : his battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem . &quot;
laser measurement technology also allows all vehicles to be captured across multiple tracks across the same time .
variable speed limit as well as transit @-@ bot@@ e to time , driving and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in high @-@ driven state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not simply cl@@ oned , he is distr@@ acted in the measurement operation so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should be protected against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer for information from Vit@@ ronic is tested in various federal states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; also foreign authorities bl@@ iss@@ ing with the new technique : recently France has folded 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
United Kingdom pic@@ ks Silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of British in the 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by came in the finals on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were taken into Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ pot stage . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji er@@ divided a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , post @-@ up , line @-@ up and ro@@ her strength to win gold - their first olymp@@ ic aille of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was failed by the not too poor tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they smote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the finale . &quot;
but irrespective of it Fi@@ ji would have fought a 15 @-@ man team in the form of a 15 @-@ man team .
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef@@ coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss of England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost her playing at Ry@@ an every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this sling is going to do , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderfully and made the attacks GB@@ s from fun intervals .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co . at , when one would run in travelling buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai is still another attack from the right @-@ hand corner from which he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has taken the ball .
&quot; a h@@ edge of Mitch@@ ell stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner has a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ fi@@ ff and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the GB is still un@@ explored . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time through and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , to Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate stop of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched a trial for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for long in favour of the South Moravian , whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake on the cake with another attempt over the last seconds .
&quot; the plu@@ ck , the fi@@ j@@ is surrounded himself and GB k@@ ick@@ ed crus@@ hing in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier in the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 , and Great Britain urged South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ er and generated a gate under the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant Tac@@ kl@@ ing from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for rowing
there will be no em@@ powered gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
&quot; from the first ru@@ d@@ der to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve , who go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment on Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only the two , which were at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was always present as she became the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without a tax woman in a result of the first women in the history of British sports that they put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; its domin@@ ance was absolutely , nevertheless its 3@@ 9.@@ ter use , which is likewise exemplary . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ os inside that gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of Spon@@ ges , which is not the kind of tri@@ om@@ ination to ge@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in Ru@@ ed@@ ars , a batt@@ ali@@ on with willing hel@@ pers to help the incre@@ mental progress , which would make the difference between 30 months ago , whether he would not survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was risky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , who is able to operate and this did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather worse situation .
it changes a bit of view .
Williams were diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the Trio was lucky that he was treating early 2014 , outside the season , could start out what the interruption stopped at a minimum , if that is in such circumstances the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 foot , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ ability of victory , her first thought of Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ er@@ ted morning to talk a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Ar@@ till@@ ery regim@@ ent in a bet in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person for wearing or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race lost over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not cope with .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark visited , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; abi@@ ding in the process , stay in the trial . &quot;
&quot; it is really important , not to be able to rip . &quot;
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking out to do some Tol@@ les .
&quot; today we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race as we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took some six months to conc@@ eive that I am a Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so res@@ sing .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years pre @-@ exemplary for clarity .
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ group &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes to retirement . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavaria , &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small fres@@ co@@ lic drinking water @-@ purpose cover as a model for the large water producers .
it was the name of some time in the original painting in a part of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken announced the ex@@ propri@@ ation of the association . &quot;
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ed stone @-@ group gel@@ te &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the use@@ able association , 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
now he was re@@ tired at the age of 65 in retirement .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ group with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality lati@@ brunn , encourages about 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and w@@ eiler with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for further towns and villages there is water supply agreements .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ n Ombud@@ sman in Ger@@ tru@@ d Stage ( F@@ W ) rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was set as water@@ beds and was appointed 1988 to the Managing Director of the Ap@@ proved Association . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , the budget@@ ary process , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency adjustment to weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; outstanding events called them the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , refurb@@ ishment of the high drilling ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the re@@ opening of water pipes . &quot;
there have been no st@@ agnation and I have always recorded innovations again because water lives de@@ ute and drinking water is the most important food .
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers tru@@ sty , reliable and accurate service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart &apos;s blood for its purpose @-@ purpose @-@ purpose , and he has lived on the water@@ purpose association , as if it would be its own company . &quot;
a few weeks ago he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ Group to the Nit@@ rat@@ ory group in front of the water forum .
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ on on the one hand praised water from Al@@ f@@ ons Sem@@ bel on the one hand I worked together with him .
he is the best water@@ bed and he was a loyal pair .
together we were an unbeatable team .
&quot; as a high point of view , he covered the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the Rest@@ ruc@@ turing of the Ap@@ pear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the hard@@ est bet was the pi@@ ping at the flood of ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ur@@ ters on a third of January . &quot;
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one can only maintain it , because you filled the container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel storms from Lau@@ gh@@ ter who advocates the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .
&quot; the sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open to the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;

&quot; when the disease had been recognized in her Son , she believed , she must die . &quot;
&quot; the now eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago be well ahead , and now privately in New York , where it is the best therap@@ ist . &quot;

relationships in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ole - man sho@@ ots on a dangerous life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ole ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and is fatal .
&quot; the man himself inv@@ oked with us and stated to have shot his life @-@ mate , &quot; &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is upon the run , after him will be publicly proclaimed . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , because S@@ ven S. could be traveling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,@@ 80 meters large , muscular , brown and has a gl@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police have released a photo of him . &quot;
it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still bear the weapon with himself , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who S@@ ven S. sees , the 110 will call . &quot;
&quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the victim is vintage 1988 , the perpet@@ rators of 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the police police in Lübeck first wanted to make no information on the ther@@ ther , or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but they confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a sol@@ der delicate . &quot;
&quot; more we say currently not , &quot; said a pol@@ ishing pre@@ cher@@ in in Lübeck . &quot;
eye @-@ witnesses therefore was a special @-@ line Com@@ mando ( SE@@ K ) in the scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the cr@@ isen@@ @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by an additional cost in meg@@ acities .
&quot; financial stresses , which the industry consists of the oil @-@ electricity funding , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it remains at the liberation of renewable energies in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fre@@ ag@@ issue ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission therefore initially planned to use the steel producer , the gases from the ho@@ fen to generate electricity for your own consumption , to checkout . &quot;
the steel industry deri@@ ving additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry sector .
&quot; Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with competition commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , f@@ alle an EEG relocation of 20 percent . &quot;
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission for the power supply .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined . &quot;
special importance was the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; steel &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot;
&quot; also at the reform of the emissions law , climate and employment targets are considering &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel sector has been suffering from the financial capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
last year the situation was further exac@@ erb@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest er@@ ci@@ ger@@ land China was raised in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand of advanced steel on the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel contra@@ sting traffic .
in the course of this spring the situation has relaxed .
&quot; for example , the economic prospects show on imports effect , on the other hand the economic prospects have risen in China . &quot;
unclear is how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p stayed on Thursday carefully .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nating . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also did not want to exclude any works of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , at the end of 2015 around 8@@ 6000 people were busy . &quot;
in July the German steel producer remains careful in spite of rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced about 3.4 million tonnes of good six percent less steel steel than in the previous year @-@ month as the economic cleaning of steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May the crowd went back to each other in the second month .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is equivalent to two percent below the previous year &apos;s previous year . &quot;
the association counts in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing is elderly good &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was in the school choir , in the Magi@@ st@@ erium , she took the subject of music , and today sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says . &quot;
at the very next door does her health and their mind do something good .
&quot; for S@@ ingen is equal from several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler by the German senior liga . &quot;
&quot; most of the seniors sing in the chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people , the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
through regular merger you can establish and maintain social contacts .
&quot; because often social and family structures at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; speak and organize themselves to be able to rely on the others , and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
because you exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who asks his lungs regular , even in everyday life not so fast from the Pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; also , if it is about getting the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German community of seniors . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common practice had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that the singing or hearing of songs with older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te , and especially melodies disp@@ enser , himself denied humans to long back events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head will also be demanded for a special performance , L@@ enz explains . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , to focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt himself to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; even older people who live alone , practicing not only to concentrate on yourself . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem is growing through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I am long for something , I become better and watch@@ ful about me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the singing , there is so enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , t L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; it does not look alone - with 50 sin@@ ful people , who list@@ ens to it , when a tone goes next to it ? &quot;
searching for the right offer seniors have seniors various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sings someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior par@@ ench@@ y@@ or , one can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over the choirs in the area .

cats react sensitive as a car@@ ater on scre@@ ams of the young animals
Bi@@ ologists studied in Hanover which effect the rod of cat@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the Gre@@ ys also did not let the males go cold - however , in contrast to the females always remained the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal &apos;s degree of cat@@ tery on the mi@@ cks of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kittens , who have found themselves in great distress , as scientists found out of the veterinary university and the medical university Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; however , K@@ ater also react to the rest of the kittens too - but always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ xes of less and strongly aroused young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is first author@@ itarian in the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens with the ur@@ gency of their assistance . &quot;
a total of nine adults were observed and eight staves from the animal hus@@ band@@ age of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a ruin of little ones who were taken for three minutes from the throw box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; for the other they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger kittens , which were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample of the sample .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted upon the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they rot@@ ten up faster to the loud@@ speaker if this ruin of the very aroused kittens .
this ability may be in@@ appropriate or develop@@ ped with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded to all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby racks . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey there was a arrest warran@@ t in Turkey against the native football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
&quot; he will be thrown , member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; for the first time after the coup , Turkey takes place an important football match in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ bish@@ ops Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ phin Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; &quot; Business as &quot; &quot; is said . &quot;
&quot; even during the suspension of the exceptional condition after the overthrow in July , the government , the everyday life of norm@@ al@@ armed men should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those who are suspected the motion of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who makes it responsible for the coup . &quot;
the football is not made available before the football .
against the former stables Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver presented the prosec@@ utor a arrest warran@@ t .
&quot; according to the meantime , the aton@@ ement has been thrown in America to be a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
aton@@ ement should be tra@@ ilers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is made responsible by the President Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup .
&quot; this is true that the first of 90 days of suspension is still valid until October , in fact that has no effect on the life of the most Turks , but as good as no effects . &quot;
the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy guards &quot; on public spaces throughout the country Erdo@@ gan is declared an end on Wednesday .
the sport is - as the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the working clubs are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
&quot; but what the cru@@ de of the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or visits .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; will arrive especially to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the ex@@ pi@@ red season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first play time as a top@@ scor@@ er of his society .
in the end game against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 @-@ winners .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him , &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; found the disap@@ point season for the record master a conc@@ il@@ able degree . &quot;
after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League of the &quot; lions &quot; also in the Europe League early .
in the south by Li@@ g it just reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the Po@@ kal was the only way to gain something .
&quot; we made it and this is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master In@@ kt@@ as ran the game year better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who was on the basis of 26 season figures as a sweet@@ ener , the basis for the 14th tracks . &quot;
this is also the reason that fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in the course of the AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez had been published under the contract and will not be announced to the put@@ ty Gom@@ ez , because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must just say it , &quot; &quot; the journal &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; Club@@ man Fi@@ Cre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do so , the storms would have to disp@@ ense around one third of his to 7.5 million euro estimated that Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence , we can not pay . &quot;
&quot; despite mental doping : these athletes still have medals chances of Olympia in Rio , &quot;
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was locked twice due to dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics s@@ sinners can only laugh it - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
the topic doping determines how before the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which had been filed after a doping @-@ lock her start right shortly before playing , was un@@ folded with their start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ c@@ il@@ ant and bu@@ ck@@ led . &quot;
&quot; it was a sk@@ ur@@ rile scenery : with a set of sm@@ iles , she was proud to be decorated in the hall , and prov@@ oked with her performance . &quot;
&quot; being fixed , that they will not get gold , the audience broke into a jubil@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other athletes , who go to the start in the Olympic Games in Rio to the Olympic Games . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had been locked for two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ champion , even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the greatest challenging one of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic stadium in 2010 had to sit a six @-@ month lock after you have detected the intake of pain kill@@ ers by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , you have had a strong tooth pain , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympic @-@ champion of 2012 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested on the botan@@ icals @-@ means meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic tre@@ k the wis@@ ely intake and has been locked six months .
the four widest lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two first world champion over 400 m , was tested in 2010 positively and 21 months have been blocked . &quot;
a means for penis enlargement has been responsible to cur@@ ated Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest growing man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athl@@ ete were subsequently detected as many med@@ alli@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; thus , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having noticed testosterone @-@ doping . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 due to testosterone abuse .
&quot; likewise , the Bronze Med@@ al of the Olympic Games in 2008 was awarded due to the judgment of the International Sports Court of Justice . &quot;
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is placed at the rank two of the world @-@ list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Go , China ) : the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ ner and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but it must still be started in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 years old World Championships , references to the intake of a ban supplement were found , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ Doping Agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Öster@@ s@@ cher@@ in in@@ jured - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ an@@ early . &quot;
&quot; she suffered car@@ vings and have been treated in the hospital , but have already left it again . &quot;
they are scheduled for their home trip in early September .
&quot; whether by the further explo@@ sions on the holi@@ day@@ Island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on also affected Austrian citizens , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , the State Department is in constant contact with local authorities , so bar@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; at around 200 kilometres south of the capital city of Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were first explo@@ ded in a walk @-@ in district two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police have been killed an Thailand and about 20 people had been in@@ jured , including the Öster@@ s@@ cher@@ in , three Germans , three defeats and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , two jumps went up high , according to the authorities a further human being was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bom@@ bing of bom@@ bs .
in det@@ on@@ ation near the near of the tourists popular Bad@@ est@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong was violated a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the southeast coast of the country then explo@@ ded another bom@@ b which had an urban accumulation .
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower field , the spr@@ int was put into the air according to the re@@ four of the coastal police force in the air . &quot;
&quot; finally , Det@@ on@@ ations called for Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b attack carry the same manuscript , &quot; said armies of Dan@@ ai criterion meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ ag@@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but it is likely to be the works of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks which is typical for the bom@@ b attack muscle separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; in contrast , the Thai police declared the attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist Movement , or with the international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is just local sab@@ ot@@ age restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; it is rather , that the bom@@ bs were laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the authorities would have received secrecy in the past few days of secrecy in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; still be unclear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police rejected their officials in the whole country , security around important government buildings as well as airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amusement districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b attacks , but they usually do not direct against tourists . &quot;
Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the Scottish bom@@ b explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Foreign Affairs on his homepage , to provide the instructions of Thai safety authorities as a result . &quot;
&quot; high safety risks ( security level 3 ) used for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no necessary travelling to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risks ( safety level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were successful a few days after a controversial referendum held by the constitution by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this spatial makes the military influence also in the coming years .
&quot; j@@ un@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ anger Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to sti@@ cking chaos while the country towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
the military un@@ ta which took power for 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest the power keeps itself good to have led the kingdom again to stability and order .
&quot; however , it was not able to have managed the military rebels in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
a year ago in Bangkok were also killed in Bangkok at a popular Hind@@ u @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identical movement &quot; is coming into the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several countries , the Constitutional Treaty also have provided the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; Iden@@ tit@@ anic movement &apos; clu@@ es for aspirations against the free democratic principles , &quot; &quot; said constitutional protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the emig@@ rants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
that is why we observe the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Iden@@ tit@@ onal movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns out against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; environ@@ ment@@ alist in nine Länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; Iden@@ tit@@ els &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate , his authority was closely aligned with the country &apos;s decision . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Iden@@ tit@@ anic movement &apos; try to pick their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally try un@@ mi@@ sts to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ ed music . &quot;
the identi@@ ties of the Islam@@ ists are as well as the right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is no extra advertising for your own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , there were reports from several Bundes@@ länder reports on contacts of the &quot; Iden@@ tit@@ ular &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species may only be relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain persons , the extrem@@ ist , its target direction is changing and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor is , therefore , whether such individuals have tax@@ able influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase of legitimate criminal off@@ ences and attacks on Asyl@@ um and Refu@@ ge@@ ese , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but we have noticed that it can be right @-@ shaped structures in the past few years .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ aler Group .
&quot; it can be quite well that further legal entities or groups of small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attack from other right @-@ wing moti@@ fs . &quot;
but a clear or pan @-@ wide control of car@@ et@@ ror@@ ism is not recognizable .
these groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate said that many transgres@@ sions left to the account of people who did not appear before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the Tat@@ ch@@ asti@@ se on Asyl@@ um , were previously not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated crime or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed before with the right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or elected by the CD@@ U , SPD or left , who then have been radic@@ alised by far right @-@ wing mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te will be the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the olymp@@ ic or world records at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly over@@ flowing s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly , that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the excerpt was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was then became the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 Star@@ tern . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather its not a sporty figure , which moved the attention of the international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participates in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians got a special start of the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in lower countries known .
&quot; as in ae@@ dic@@ s , most athletes run , simply wanted to make something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the lap .
some media called him as &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; well @-@ wearing &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ leaf &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Fre@@ est@@ l , played out there . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medit@@ ational attention .
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l alone . &quot;
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically was fired in M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i back then .
the back then 22 @-@ year @-@ old came to swim just eight months before Olympia and had never taken such a distance before the competition .

&quot; if it does not lie for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;

G@@ F@@ K leadership will step forward to disap@@ end business
the consumer research company Gf@@ K stops his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the returns were suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K sm@@ iles , that the chair of Vor@@ ste@@ sch@@ ef Matthias Hart@@ mann was all the more uncertain , the longer the success of him was promised . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again the business figures and the withdrawal of corporate management is the worldwide number five in the industry before a personalized new beginning .
G@@ F@@ K @-@ Management boss wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K @-@ Supervisory Board Ar@@ no grinding bow@@ ls already separ@@ ates with effect from September 12 out of the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the management in the board took over the previous Board of Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , divided the company with it already on 1 September . &quot;
&quot; he should officially accept the function of a &quot; &quot; spokes@@ person &quot; , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason to return , the company called &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; to the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot;
details would not want to call a company on Friday .
&quot; whoever will become the market research company in future , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ circles , on Friday , the disappointment was last great for the continued success of recent years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ Top since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of the restructuring is not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; says it . &quot;
in the face of the last bad Gf@@ K business I will pay un@@ quiet at some point .
&quot; if that would be the case at BMW , that would also make the qui@@ z as it was . &quot;
the company did not stop its loss in the preceding quarters in the second quarter of 2016 .
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales rose by 6.@@ 1 percent below the level of comparison of the previous year figure . &quot;
&quot; based on the first half @-@ year shr@@ ink of revenues generated with 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million euros , by 3.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter , the profit in the second quarter has been deb@@ ited from the present value of the company in the light of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
the company Consumer Experience mandatory in its Consumer Experience requires a loss of 139 million euros to the Group under which St@@ rich had a loss of 14@@ 8.5 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 the Gf@@ K had still generated a profit of 19.@@ 7 million .

the un@@ last travelers were brought back from a scheduled bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ c@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .

&quot; the fees per cu@@ bic metres of wast@@ ew@@ ater will be held from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Flo@@ wer@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( until 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( until 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will later be improved again if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a ski@@ pping calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4,@@ 37 euro per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was noted in the approval of the budget due to the farmhouse with Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems . &quot;
&quot; the market of Kas@@ endorf is committed to a legal basis , to make the facilities costly . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the trade and industrial actu@@ ators from Wel@@ igh@@ s , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ es , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg must take deeper into the money bag . &quot;
the ag@@ it@@ ators are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board showed Herbert Schmidt the body , a new calculation of fees for se@@ wage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also over @-@ / or sub@@ covers from the previous calculation period .
&quot; the gra@@ vi@@ val structures set up Schmidt in order to take relatively small facilities for relatively small water installations , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic metres per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution base , for example , funding for necessary repairs can affect several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ew@@ ater in all three plants is slightly declined . &quot;
&quot; further , in the back period of calculations at all three systems , not least due to their age of san@@ itation and repair expenditure in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the installations for the round , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt rejected that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf had to be exchanged due to any damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sh@@ ank , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and at the pond @-@ plant Lop@@ p had to be extended after nearly 20 years operation of the first Kl@@ är@@ bel , the Kl@@ är@@ bel machine , and an additional v@@ ents can be installed in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued care and maintenance costs came into account in accordance with the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs resulting from the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 still considerably below the current level .
stone houses made clear that at low wast@@ ew@@ ater in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance .
&quot; it was , added Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs at the se@@ wage systems during the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious , especially since one could not extend the supply area of the wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment of Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal in order to not extend these facilities because it is dedicated to de@@ ity facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation was in Bulgaria in July 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first on zero since October of last year , as a positive 0,@@ 2 % . &quot;
annual average reduction of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 ) amoun@@ ted to -@@ 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.@@ 2 % .
in July 2016 the following groups of consumer goods has been observed : food and non alcoholic beverages ( 1.9 % ) ; transportation and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.@@ 3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.@@ 3 % ) .
&quot; the prices fell by clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine species ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
S@@ nap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critici@@ zed as Asian caric@@ ature
&quot; S@@ nap@@ chat says that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ bly towards breeds . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , S@@ nap@@ chat will allow S@@ nap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders an absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
the filters are imp@@ lied and discrete tools that generate more than 30 million improved r@@ ust per day .
all failures to the public are to the public .
&quot; S@@ nap@@ chat filters have expressed criticism in the past , in which they were accused that the app can propag@@ ate Black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week struck a filter several users , which gave them s@@ lu@@ ster , false teeth and raised che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow @-@ sigh@@ ted . &quot;
they asked if this repeated controversy sur@@ passed on a larger problem that the company has diversity with diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebellion were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after S@@ nap@@ chat that it would have been disabled . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant as a hom@@ age to Ani@@ me characters and not as a caric@@ ature of Asian .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , which have experienced r@@ is@@ dis@@ m , rec@@ alled the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail I wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American student , whose t@@ we@@ et were spread far beyond the photos that the filter viol@@ ates and at least was said uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ly sigh@@ ted , but that the yellow @-@ sigh@@ ted was drawn down to the counter . &quot;
S@@ nap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural defic@@ its .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless seal and integration struggle , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
&quot; and S@@ nap@@ ch@@ ats a great audience of young people - who are in the matter of race different than their older counterparts - could more likely go beyond sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; when one of S@@ nap@@ ch@@ ats made a picture created that such things remain un@@ noticed , then it was much harder that such things was un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; said the 25 year old K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Zh@@ u decided to work as a product @-@ manager and engineering in the medium , her S@@ nap@@ chat account would be asking for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that racial chec@@ ker promises a lack of diversi@@ fication in the practices in S@@ nap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the large part white ; only male leadership and ended their asc@@ ended with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ S@@ nap@@ chat .
&quot; either they do not have various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the s@@ nap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it rejected S@@ nap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company has recently focused a personnel responsible , focusing on population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; in his turn , Zh@@ u said that she is closed her s@@ nap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that this is not o.@@ k@@ . &quot;
&quot; contracting IS@@ IS Intelligence information , presents Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military operation of the United States Central Command changed subsequent information to record an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual conditions at the venue in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the dispute settlement , secret service comm@@ on@@ ations and the defensive budget , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command intelligence agencies , reported such as superi@@ ors their assess@@ ments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; Central Command , just C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence services , which were typically received by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com , signed regularly a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions were allowed on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; said an article about the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , re@@ publi@@ can member of the Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the managers in Cent@@ Com are enough to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report presents detailed continuous problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that Government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how an@@ alysts themselves exposed to the pressure from its laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as IS@@ IS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half year 2015 there were many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , statements and statements in front of Congress clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com has been publicly known that a military re@@ conquest Mos@@ sul@@ s can already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city of Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , re@@ publi@@ que Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the tops of Central Command changed the following reports to play the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force into life , after them , an@@ alysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge during investigations .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Secretary of Defense . &quot;
democratic members of Mess@@ ek@@ om@@ it@@ ania published on Thursday their own findings that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created a moder@@ ately restricted process for the creation of en@@ roll@@ able assess@@ ments to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest democr@@ at in the commander , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as Mr. ship , &quot; delayed the publication of downstream reports , &quot; in@@ quired the mor@@ als of an@@ alysts and gave excessive amount of space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. ship and the Democrats have found no references to an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts with regard to a &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were received after complaints from Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a prestige of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would have no reports of Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor would still be underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ ting opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversy about these important issues of national defence . &quot;
investigations have gone out about the question of a successful aviation campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion which is now being done by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command at the Central Command in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret formations over the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , saw the recommendations of many an@@ alysts only a small cre@@ d@@ stru@@ al in Iraq and have little time on it to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker following indication of government agencies that contrary the statements of the government attacks against the Islamic State of the terrorist group had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since this tent@@ ative refinement could have taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
&quot; this realization however was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger comm@@ its , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure because of its superior positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing prior to the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA winning the fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women - a show@@ down with Great Britain is before
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also saw the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember it ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not belonging to people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first square that remains un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain first and second place within their group . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will go for a little longer out of the way that will lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may start on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising tur@@ ers through their success story , four years after they landed on the last of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years she played a ho@@ ckey ack@@ et in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became nation @-@ player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as it was not able to qualify for the cad@@ res .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team went everything . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team , and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , an mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work place in London that we have now .
we have been able to tear the rest of the rest .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the Tor@@ ri@@ gen in the first half of the game with a return from the se@@ am .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly strong and held the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until they took their hands into their hands . &quot;
&quot; they accomplished a Spr@@ int with the shallow ball through the left side , then moved to the center and swal@@ lowed the ball into the gate for the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 tour . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the ke@@ e@@ pers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs that had to book at least one gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just as like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and ines@@ capable , a rapid rel@@ ent@@ on between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning strip , who is protected from w@@ rist@@ band to swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ athl@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you can not switch on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue in the Coff@@ ee@@ hop , without having Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ as@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is no log@@ on Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could possibly have been sent to Prime Time , being built to Prime Time , being built to Prime Time , Tur@@ ner or even Fe@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the olymp@@ ic trampoline of gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame does not include any event equal .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not commonly accepted : air pist@@ ol shoot , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo . &quot;
we will always have the fli@@ ppers and may not rule it for a long time .
&quot; but if I might be humble arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline is already a olymp@@ ic event since 2000 when it was in Sydney his debut , it was noticed the last 16 years so spar@@ se that many those who wondered , did not know that there is at all a olymp@@ ic art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had succeeded until 2012 , who made it to the final . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans for women to share .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ si@@ der char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ resolved ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ School than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ ons tre@@ m@@ bling of his never to @-@ end swing - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports that it is essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as the spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , he@@ els and sal@@ es@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official olymp@@ ic column after execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are compete in Rio to compete . &quot;
the common olymp@@ ic vector is straight .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and dr@@ on , sometimes until the finish , sometimes go and back , up and down in the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the initial wall , but in the television transmission also a further cav@@ ity target : the world or the Olympic @-@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the target @-@ oriented pursuit is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal , and it is enough to even stir up a host to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I think even when looking at these games as something che@@ ered .
this trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is up .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ un@@ t , seemingly un@@ he@@ el@@ os like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then upwards , then effort@@ less again . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dream@@ y , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition with the Olympic Games can be only .
&quot; the qualification and En@@ dr@@ apes of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13.00 Eastern time ; those of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will be@@ aming the ends as part of a after@@ no@@ ons at two days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who will likely be over@@ looked in general tumor . &quot;
&quot; when the awareness raising awareness can only be achieved by the att@@ acking and the lens of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his according to air rin@@ se , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the USA &quot;
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators are calling for political changes in Ethiopia , silent on violent resistance of the government . &quot;
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esting while clas@@ hes with the police were killed .
is Ethiopia exactly to break up ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
but in the past few months protests against the government the country and spread themselves in more and more areas .
last week of thousands of people on the streets and slow@@ ed fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful according to human rights organizations .
witnesses made that polic@@ emen appeared on the zig @-@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; in the run @-@ run videos about the protests , which probably are from the last or beginning of this year , show how security men young people hit with staves , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the leader of the UN authority for Human Rights is now calling for an incoming investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this land and in future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , particularly in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands at the considerable pace .
his infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pend@@ ulum in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously emphasized the repression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with Dis@@ si@@ dents effectively became silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that might change .
&quot; if you press people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest it breaks it off , &quot; said Se@@ eber@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ies . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover all from the soil use up to the stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time tensions continue along the border to Eritrea ; a battle for this tor@@ tured , controversial line demanded in June hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which were more or less forced in recent years , the turbul@@ ence and could be armed again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of em@@ bit@@ tering after years of the for@@ war@@ ns are now explo@@ ded under the surface .
the first appears harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even when the government leaves access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially with protests , so many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that conce@@ al them where they stay . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave that they gathered so too prot@@ rac@@ ed .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons prosp@@ eri@@ ed the Am@@ har@@ as , which are from ether predominantly Christian high @-@ countries , in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and in flat land @-@ areas . &quot;
but also this is changing .
&quot; we are doing under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were held in areas of Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in the intelligence , and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former vine guide , was until his death at a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tic genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; an@@ alysts say that he was particularly embarrass@@ ed in it , early indications of dis@@ satisfaction and use special officers to process opponent and to make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic idea , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety services rendered by the tiger @-@ controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time , Ethiopia lived such a tur@@ mo@@ il was born in 2005 , after thousands against elections prot@@ ested , according to the statements by analy@@ st apparently dec@@ eived by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following swe@@ eps many prot@@ esters have been killed , even if it was less than in the last months , and this time of un@@ rest went over relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new pend@@ ulum train , as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month attacked pro@@ mul@@ ing in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ish city , by Tig@@ ray guided businesses and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st tell the protests the US and other Western allies led to a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently rus@@ hed to make this base closed . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally breaks into an already vol@@ ati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declares his claim Obama that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by declar@@ ing his multi @-@ repeated proposition , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State of Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fying new questions on the communication skills of the presidential system of the Re@@ public@@ ans whether he may be able to communicate with the American public .
&quot; it also brings its collaborators , who make efforts to take him during an event@@ ful phase , to explain in the peculi@@ ar position , statements that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at a voting event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp in relation to the asser@@ tion on Thursday returns and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said , he is simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , at which Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help weak@@ en the statement something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , that Mr Obama wanted to destroy it from the Republi@@ can presidential candidate . &quot;
the last storm of the cri@@ tique fell down to Mr. Tru@@ mp while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of random transformations to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to its defence .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself as he said , the Russians should cra@@ w@@ ling Mrs. Clin@@ ton E@@ mail , but later he said &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the linguistic borders in politics and then back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages can be taken from his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert in the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also think he is clever enough to hold his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has assumed an even stronger sound since its revers@@ ed values are further declined . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with a great advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ at head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries to fail to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he is focusing increasingly in focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal co @-@ talks to him , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant his statements may also be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York , and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani , he said to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her but@@ t@@ ant , completely false and therefore it happened because he left the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstre@@ am re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as a out@@ si@@ ster@@ in , it carried out IS@@ IS permitted to spread the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the voting events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and bow@@ ed them before , on each of his words , and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he burned the &quot; poor , j@@ ec@@ mer@@ nal &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; You can not ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the democrats were sorry about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once more than the price of the market is pushed back café in Green@@ point
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was an ashamed cafe in William@@ sburg where you could pay only bar , which was no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years a good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , thanks to the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the verb in the summer of 2014 was sold , sold soap in the form of c@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
native people consuming it as the last loss in a rainy city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ out@@ wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is , then it is also a re@@ discovery . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of his original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
coffee is also still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ term staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; as he offered a customer to provide money for a new outer station , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , enter@@ tained many . &quot;
verb uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same Esp@@ res@@ som@@ asch@@ ine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and che@@ eses and there are Gar@@ ni@@ ys like K@@ AP@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural sc@@ iss@@ ors .
&quot; the café serves not a beer more , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ ened current in old master customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed through prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , dwelt in William@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after they moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way up . &quot;
&quot; after the verb closed , she gave a while the coffee ch@@ r@@ ines , she said . &quot;
&quot; I became clear that it was coffee and on the culture in the verb , which fell me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they ordered this day instead of her usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ing C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered in@@ vari@@ ably the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss tor@@ o and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t have a Gro@@ ll over that the soap shop has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ ery offered a special soap for verb with the cold coffee of coffee as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish people Green@@ points , the cafe also accepted . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez , that he has presented to make them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ locally would like to fill the cold @-@ cooked coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance to expand the café on a b@@ b@@ art@@ board building .
for many customers a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites .
&quot; Joseph WIT@@ T was regular certificate , and said he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entering of the Lok@@ als and the bri@@ des had a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to rie@@ ve the &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the depres@@ sing meal of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as gour@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was somewhat modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ ato Sau@@ ce , potato p@@ ree and as dessert a P@@ fl@@ au@@ men@@ pu@@ d@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ies .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was told by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per publishing house , illustrated the history of American cuisine while the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh k@@ äs@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn ate with potato p@@ ree and vegetable @-@ emission . &quot;
&quot; when the Re@@ porter Hack@@ br@@ aten ordered , this found the pair of discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , liver , and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little gem that is stretched .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have been placed in the stomach like B@@ lei , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in a American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; cre@@ ws of women are co@@ ded for male field workers and it was freshly baked Past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; they were the Americans who sent to hunger for star@@ ing Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; a square &quot; &quot; marks the paths , with which the country went with it , no longer the Sh@@ lar@@ en@@ land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans a central , tense theme , &quot; beg@@ ging Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new budget : mysterious food such as lo@@ aves and cas@@ ser@@ ts have been found to stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ olle as a &quot; wonderful way , eating remains r@@ ored , &quot; commented Zi@@ egel@@ man , since Kö@@ che un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients could hide under a cre@@ am@@ y sauce . &quot;
fresh fruits was replaced by cheap dry .
&quot; meat , which was for years the center of American cuisine , was become a rarely @-@ fourth luxury . &quot;
peculi@@ ar mis@@ ses were tried out since a cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing satisfaction has priority to taste or even healthy teeth .
&quot; during her research for the book , which includes also recipes , prepared Zi@@ egel@@ man a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons fit not to each other .
it was typical for many of the domestic recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , drives budget - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country so such . &quot;
&quot; by taking recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budget@@ ary female &quot; and to transform the challenge , Pamp@@ as such as cre@@ am@@ y sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square pays &quot; is a celebration of historical ti@@ db@@ its .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ eating position . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmhouses of his kitchen , he has grown like the milli@@ meter severe man of the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental kitchen like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost de@@ pl@@ ated dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was delightful real@@ ism .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had prompted him to stat@@ u@@ ate his stomach with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ ke@@ eper with no interest in flavours by Ms Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt that the White House brought the boring food in Washington but also one of the most stuck . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food was rejected , once the land came back on legs . &quot;
&quot; the Legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave us better understood when writing the book , the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man in law - for example , as they could not throw food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; they did not actually sick . &quot;
there was the wind metabolism .
&quot; after the plates were vac@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e cooked a dessert that had prepared it at home : the P@@ fl@@ au@@ men@@ tions , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , humble recipes was a send name to miss . &quot;
&quot; there was no curved cream , only pl@@ ums , some fl@@ our , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each deaf little rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to have a spo@@ on in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it tasted not bad . &quot;
Co@@ e won three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few sh@@ opp@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bom@@ bs attack : he was the Hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the Hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he refres@@ hed everything to save others the life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old even has died in an un@@ bom@@ bs attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ met , &quot; a civil protection group , which was saved to the life according to the picture of nearly 6@@ 0.000 people . &quot;
2@@ 900 Volun@@ te@@ ers put their own lives in the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make the first help in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a cleansing from the ruins of a house , went to the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans to the shining symbol in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; but as a hero he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I am dying , save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself joined the attack he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b attack in Syria .
&quot; Heli@@ x have thrown four fac@@ bom@@ bs above the ICTR district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bom@@ b , lest children play with it , &quot; quoted the image of his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest spine is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland mostly come only in winter to surface finish .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return after an investigation on board the boat trip S@@ anna into the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good one at 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland only with 150 years grew .
&quot; based on the Greenland shar@@ k at the bottom of the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , speeds up the five meters long animal on s@@ atte 2.@@ 6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
this of long@@ itude @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age .
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein by Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span , which means for verteb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the theory of evolution already assumed for a long time that Greenland may become stone . &quot;
only failed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sk@@ inn@@ y coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius they dive at the surface mostly only in winter .
&quot; about the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers know accordingly . &quot;
&quot; your time @-@ pent@@ ag@@ o moderation they , when they com@@ fy six animals with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; loo@@ t make this sh@@ arks anyway : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young ic@@ eb@@ le . &quot;
possibly hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ic@@ me@@ eres and look car@@ c@@ asses that from higher waters down to the bottom .
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as Bei@@ fang from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long while the largest 5@@ 02 centimeters .
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method the lin@@ ens of sh@@ arks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ id is already created prior to the birth of the sh@@ arks , which the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie down after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons , large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the length of 220 cm , the length of the smallest animal sof@@ tens the ruler of the lens against carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland in its ruler , in contrast , had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes , which is created by cosmic rays inside the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland , during the record @-@ shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 centimeters even 3@@ 92 years of age . &quot;
&quot; after the Greenland female only then re@@ grew , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age . &quot;
&quot; because one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timet@@ res probably stood at the cus@@ p of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie became apparent at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
also this is likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live especially in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland , in whose sp@@ eck at the N@@ acken a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on , was caught in Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism also runs on savings . &quot;
so they mature later - and slowly slower .
&quot; to keep warm up in cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; the volume increases much faster than its surface , by which the animal has heat . &quot;
the heat loss from one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a grams of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the theory of evolution . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , a very large animal should invest more in a long life against it . &quot;
construction grounds in double pack
with subjects around the building the community has focused on the recent meeting .
&quot; with relief the body took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the commerci@@ alization of the recently recorded residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the ground@@ work , par@@ cel@@ e and final requests clari@@ fied and the applications for measurement could be clari@@ fied , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Stre@@ ets path &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ strasse - External section 1 ) has nothing more in ways . &quot;
the community is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and touching the elderly alike .
&quot; as it was meant that builders can immediately report in the city hall , on the allocation of par@@ c@@ els , the community is expected to consult at its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also inquiries to the settlement of other commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , we decided to change the common plan in the spring of this year . &quot;
thus in the area of sub @-@ lar@@ ged there is already indicated in the area around two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city on the Main , therefore , in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg has the best chances to reloc@@ ate jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most distinguished by Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um &quot; , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ang , Head of the center &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport the approval in the UK has so far enough for the so @-@ called EU passport .
this is precisely the use of big US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ certificate &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; anticip@@ ates more than 10000 new jobs on the Main and five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the biggest banks in the eurozone is united as well as other major authorities such as European insurance for E@@ IO@@ PA and Risk Cor@@ ats ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg was indeed a large fund sector , but cuts down to Dublin as well as Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt am clearly easier to achieve thanks to the big airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city has easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ am . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the Mi@@ ets for first @-@ class commercial properties are in order to be 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the business consultancy Merc@@ er , the city is standing in place seven , Luxembourg on position 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; , &quot; declare the I@@ W . &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um of the most important financial center in Europe .
&quot; for this , the power relations : in London also speak to numbers from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead is awarded right from the Hepatitis C patent stre@@ it with Mer@@ ck
a US assistant decided that Gilead Sciences Sciences Inc claim to the reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs that you have emerged from the hep@@ atitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was freed from a compensation install@@ ment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which covered in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge a pattern of mis@@ behavior from Mer@@ cks , including the opinion and other unpleasant actions . &quot;
&quot; in the collection of the law@@ suit on Thursday said US minist@@ erial in Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , that Gilead is entitled to dro@@ pping the cost , which were created during the defence of the fall . &quot;
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate Gilead to heal the market of a new generation of hep@@ atitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver illness .
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 , as Gilead and Mer@@ ck meet each other and claimed property on lab work , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir el@@ ic@@ el@@ ag , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;

Clin@@ ton earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.@@ 2 % of federal taxes
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton released its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in a revenue of USD 10.@@ 75 million and its husband for an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ ton USD 1 Million ended up for charitable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton had opened a income of USD 3 million by Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ton candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax statements of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hidden behind false interpre@@ tations and ref@@ unds with respect to his previous promises to publish its tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish its tax statements , although it is not obliged to do so . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax evasion by tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ ker election in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential did@@ ine of Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special Consultants , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already missed out that his ex@@ propri@@ ation issues relating to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business deal@@ ings and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp call for his tax statement .
on Thursday she spoke the subject also during a speech on the economy of Michigan .
he refused to do what has done any other presidential did@@ actic in recent decades and to publish its tax statements . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has no or only paid very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times cited on Friday a number of tax evasion and tax advis@@ ers , the indications that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ et which would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a voting event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ alists have asked his seat to exchange Tru@@ mp at a meeting in order to exchange their tax statements . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ et said , he was subjected to the IR@@ S as well as a tax check of the IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not in front of the tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ ton campaign has reg@@ ained tax return until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ ton , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,@@ 5 % . &quot;
the tax statement of the Clin@@ ton from 2015 showed that this only amounts to USD 100 of its income compared to the majority of all Americans .
&quot; their main joints was a cost @-@ effective index funds , from which the Clin@@ ton divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

&quot; previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend oneself . &quot;
Friday is dedicated to the phone Day that is dedicated to the animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ...

Jewish Director sm@@ ashing Berlin Hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ folded a media up@@ watch , after having betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli code as there should be Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his trouble at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the coun@@ sel@@ ing list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers a way to choose Israel through its own call center . &quot;
looking for a statement the director turned to the Hotel &apos;s reception .
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel asked that the measure is a &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
&quot; the reason that it stood , extingu@@ isher in the director nor more anger . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs , and they demanded that the election is deleted , the acceptance of Lan@@ z@@ mann was cited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ trade , called this a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this really is very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has borne this in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame .
this does not require statement .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
&quot; the incident , a fairly large resonance on the internet , in which people know the whole a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some under@@ scored the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it could have given the alleged call of the Arabian guests .
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; was it in another post , where it was noted that the hotel is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismis@@ sed all accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ ze &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct directive , &quot; Israel does not enter into the quick@@ list &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung writes an spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has been added now .

&quot; students are together at the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo together with the police , when they gathered together to demonstrate the reforms of the government for public education system . &quot;
the police sat by Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ ke against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to prescri@@ bes the students , which led the police of Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
several hundred students participated in demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about plans .
&quot; according to the proposals of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be converted to save money . &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president of Michel T@@ emer of walls .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Teheran in the yearly comparison to 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran has been lifted , the interest in Russia grew strongly in shops in the country , divided by the amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
Russian companies provide existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further commercial construction is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
it indicates that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 per cent spr@@ int and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade fair was reached by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian overseas reloc@@ ate around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily from Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , of Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which affects the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Irish tourists in Russia will be broken down from the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the Ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend the visit of the cities Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

the mini @-@ stran@@ ts from the E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage walk from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages have been done .
&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next door of all mini @-@ stran@@ ts , over a period of two years , the upper @-@ minist@@ erial St. Anna is decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage goals was checked and one decided finally for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ es of Freiburg , where this year was offered a special pilgrimage goal during this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy at the Frei@@ burger Münster , a special pilgrimage goal . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is made from peti@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ rooms spread their way . &quot;

&quot; from Hor@@ b , by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where there was also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er Lady , and so the pilgrimage came away from the Münster . &quot;
&quot; the single day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writing . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night in men &apos;s team @-@ Spr@@ int in the Vel@@ o@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow accepted the An@@ chor@@ us , who had made his land of Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the yoke and made the legend proud , when he came home to d@@ ashed a victory from the favorites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England also claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the trick , after she spent in March at the Railway World Championships in London despite the withdrawal Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the operator Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a execution .
&quot; Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close . &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man , where they stayed when they saw potential in the br@@ isk , which has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y sealed - and Sk@@ inner took a Olympic stadium in the qualifying round , but the New Zealand turned into the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his round trip almost back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner did it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , during the execution in a higher course , to slow it and allow it Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to hold the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert , and fell at Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they came up on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make me a name .
&quot; in the En@@ dr@@ unde , we have placed a olymp@@ ic chord and conquered the world champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the 2012 triumph , on the side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys announced that he was clearly visible after a weak start . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England &apos;s Riv@@ als .
there was such a problem with such a clear victory for this time .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels the whole GB flags on the Tri@@ b@@ ün@@ e like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven of ten titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect successful five days at the bike @-@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the realm of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , which was also born on 23 March ( a apparently hom@@ ey date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ hat , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a explo@@ iters of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
these are the same by Ho@@ y alike .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
&quot; it feels something lonely , alone to win . &quot;
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the fourth @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 42 on the goal .
&quot; the World Record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ dge Station with safety in focus . &quot;
&quot; he had risen yesterday with representatives of qualifications , as the officials to stand up to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , the morning continued and ended , av@@ anced Laura Trot@@ sk@@ ates , Jo@@ anna RP S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie archives in World tre@@ k@@ ord@@ era in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team left its strong railway wheel team to dominate the middle period of Olympic Games and to pick up a shot of medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio downloaded .
&quot; Dr@@ amas played in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical Leit@@ ers Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex and har@@ b@@ ing@@ es , as well as re@@ tired of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees himself the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ o@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB@@ s that has reached the perfect moment its peak has to be repeated again . &quot;
future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land due to lifting the consumption query
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - standing on the game , since the system operator will terminate the energy supplier and thus lift all the supply agreements , such as the supplied energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a maximinum payout for 20 years is running in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand on the game .
&quot; no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct , as well as indirect - could be endangered in a closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino@@ effects since the mel@@ ting sh@@ aking around 10 percent of the entire electricity generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closing of the fro@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risk a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian Dollars and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the big aluminum mel@@ tdown with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , told that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is in the multilingual property of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp. An@@ p smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to be powered , resulting in further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L also said that the contracts called &quot; backup stores &quot; , &quot; which should have been in force from November 2016 . &quot;
the Treaties have a 12 @-@ month period of notice so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will be contributing to the revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the power supply . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ology for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L distributed , that the value of the contracts were already written in the amount of $ 187 million in the expect@@ ancy of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the mel@@ ting or to ensure the power supply to the mel@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year deal with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into effect from November this year , even though it is still an explanation of why it came back from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st warn of the bad economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of the Port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago system near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 me@@ ga@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 me@@ ga@@ watts to electricity . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as an electricity producer , this would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; K@@ end@@ om big sister Kim likes her , having be@@ aten the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most popular edition of the year for vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , that resembles more of a picture @-@ band as a fashion journal , the output attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( S@@ aut ) of Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were published by the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling stock ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the unveil@@ ing of its Co@@ ver@@ stars will be as much addic@@ tive , that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine is still in front of the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ rities , the mod@@ les &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els , &quot; the celeb@@ rities &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or Tra@@ vels Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a model &quot; &quot; of their generation , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous individuals or Reality stars or teenagers of today , who know how to turn a good S@@ nap@@ chat video ( even if it is true to Jen@@ ner ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who are exhibiting in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once that appeared on the last cover with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade was one of the most successful years of her career .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success . &quot;
with her Reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers position was always something tense in the fashion world .
in June he critici@@ zed the one @-@ common Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the rental pieces of the moment .
these feelings are again high when the message with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but riding on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
you sold by her made pictures of C@@ indy cra@@ w@@ ds daughter to the magazine love .
and in their leisure time they can be seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; coun@@ cill@@ ors point 16@@ 0.000 people annually , &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 inhabitants of the country are rejected annually by the municipal treas@@ ury centers , while the industry sets out on the effects of other medium cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ants and those who have no means for un@@ just delay and legal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ dated , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
&quot; the director of the community centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Gover@@ ment centres were revealed , that thousands of people were rejected each year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation without a abolition of the law of the federal government would only be worse .
&quot; que@@ ens Community law centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with uns@@ afe and oppres@@ sive debt , families that have been released by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent since June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpl@@ ess@@ ation people will be forced out of Queensland , with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the Gener@@ alb@@ und@@ es@@ ee lawyer and the Federal judicial Minister , as well as the sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis , to raise these central cuts down immediately , so people need the help they need to obtain legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provincial government filled their commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community service centres and their customer communities , as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k will invest in this important work . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for government parties are SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
this took part @-@ representative surveys of the opinion of the research Institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government co @-@ operation in northern Germany could not follow shortly , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and had a good chance to continue to present the government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD of 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent lowered five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ l , the party was only barely just before the CD@@ U which could come back to 23 per cent . &quot;
the third place is disp@@ uted between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left amounts to 19 percent ( formerly 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; despite more light losses , the Gre@@ ens were compared to 6 percent ( before 8,@@ 7 percent ) in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; with 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be present in land@@ day with 3 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD of the survey was according to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28@@ ,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 percent .
this is still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return , the pirates would not miss in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first Smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in time lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the followers of the world today dominate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ os and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite a du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight me@@ gab@@ ytes , which would rise today for about two r@@ ust with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ yte .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , to the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros lovers can buy the devices in the internet , but they somehow originate from the stone @-@ time of the internet age . &quot;
20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at CeBIT in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West Bank format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the Communic@@ ator to reach . &quot;
even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers as well as agon@@ izing slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available to a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was € 3@@ 92 .
nobody could see in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
&quot; the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the cell division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled in Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; the market master today , who all came a lot later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; forever and everywhere , this is today for very many people in everyday life . &quot;
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; approximately 1,4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple alone over 5@@ 55 million pieces . &quot;
the worldwide turnover with the devices is about 400 billion euros .
these are the well running shops of the countless app provider and telecommunic@@ ation .
around the smartphone has developed a whole industry in the meantime .
&quot; at the beginning of 2007 , the crucial breakthrough on mass market came back at the beginning of 2007 , then announced Apple @-@ boss Steve Jobs on the Mac World for the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone , and an internet communication , all per touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the bo@@ oting of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market they had to see . &quot;
&quot; finally she disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian suppliers as Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; in the cut , every German now looks after 88 times a day on his cell phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to buy the smartphone also sometimes , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Board of Staff . &quot;
persistent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the olymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw is not only used in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction He@@ a@@ on , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will come again by creating new possibilities for local people and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities we alone will build up 10,000 new appren@@ tices , creating more than 40@@ ,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ zu@@ by is too great . &quot;
&quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage . &quot;
the two @-@ fl@@ ers had wrong and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to d@@ wind@@ ling but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question .
how the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in local growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in order to leave the airport and in the whole GB . &quot;
&quot; we have been a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion expensive investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , built in the midst of the two frequencies of the world . &quot;
they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk to what is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
London &apos;s London Olympics were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time that we ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and He@@ a@@ throw and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment in which England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; regarding ad recorder &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money earn money according to one of the software manufacturers attempts , adverti@@ sers to handle , a &quot; &quot; K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would block advertisements on his desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a B@@ log@@ post where users may update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday told Facebook with that his desktop side would change the co@@ ding regarding his advertising view , in order to complain about what part of the site advertising is to be difficult to complain . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announces that there has found a new way to deal with the new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this type of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ struggle between the ad@@ versary open source community and the uph@@ e@@ ers have already been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has been put into battle , is a powerful indication of how worrying adverti@@ sers have become for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study , according to a study of the last year of Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people ad lock@@ ers , almost four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ ly makes 84 percent of the value of Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has agreed on the ad block on desktop PCs , since mobile advertising blocking does not have any effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient size of revenue , so that Facebook appears the investment of such a stri@@ de as re@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that there would be &quot; &quot; adverti@@ sers &quot; &quot; to have more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday claimed Facebook that Ad@@ Block would be a new filter , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users that is not a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , shared a speaker from Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; adverti@@ sers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we are focusing on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
Ms with suspected su@@ icide on Swiss highway
the victim lay at the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witness having a woman in the early hours of the morning at an suspected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 in the region of Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman slept in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police in Vau@@ d said . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a silence at the age of 49 years , managed by several vehicles , including a burden of trucks , was to kill himself . &quot;
she still died on site .
&quot; several drivers were already heard , but some are still not identified , the police , which as well as any witnesses of the incident have requested to report . &quot;
&quot; it was opened a study procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , distributed Gill@@ es Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
however it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not held accountable .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway ran - was decided that the drivers are not going out of it that a pedest@@ rians in the middle of the night is running on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year was acqu@@ itted a polic@@ eman of the neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings after spending a man and killed that in August 2014 of a night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne .
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become unconscious on the street unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the court realized that the polic@@ eman -- which had responded to a call -- in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was an &quot; completely exceptional and un@@ predictable situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges was to report the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate @-@ amo@@ d@@ ells probably once inhab@@ itable .
&quot; scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms , which resem@@ ble to those of climate research . &quot;
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus won with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once er@@ d@@ similar conditions could be reported . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , a similar atmosphere , and still slowly turned out . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than on earth , but once enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accomo@@ date lives and spread more quickly . &quot;
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent in matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow re@@ turn of Venus its daily page of the Sun almost two months &quot; , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of a much of the solar heat . &quot;
the result are average temperatures that are a few degrees cool@@ ers than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a story of Venus that resembles that of evolution that was previously thought by Plan@@ etary researchers .
&quot; although it was presum@@ ably inhab@@ itable since it was Venus -- over the course of several billions years , with much heat and ultra @-@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans dil@@ uted and their vap@@ or was burned down by the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
&quot; as its hydro@@ gen , it remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate @-@ amo@@ d@@ ells at the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Avalon anche with energy , passion and certainty , the 50 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old Roy was in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; I have been thinking of the summer for a long time and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , this it requires and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly adapted to the organization . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to decision @-@ making decisions , which influence the performance of the team . &quot;
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had annex@@ ed Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 during his debut season .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers will resume talks again and strike strikes
&quot; the labour struggles regarding the wage compensation for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ ler are exposed , while all disputes are put to the table for a new round of round . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field of Wood Group became spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally performed on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ammed unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current struggle , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day meetings in the next few weeks to start the beginning of next year to address the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contrasts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the ratings of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company have the required space to get through the market recovery .
&quot; Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon their oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , since its business activities as a result of its me@@ de@@ composition connection with the British energy companies BG Group ration@@ alised . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are due to the lower pipe prices under pressure , an economic situation which had reinforced by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish member of Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest employment activities that have been held since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy , which works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of about $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the observ@@ atory of the Ple@@ j@@ adas
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ square teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most popular catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ adas .
&quot; the new data helps to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars in the star loops to different pensions , as well as in which context the rotation periods with the Plan@@ etary origins . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ isons of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the observ@@ atory of the Ple@@ j@@ adas is 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this constellation , which originated about 125 million years ago , can now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
you are now taking the fastest .
at peak rates come across these gri@@ pping stars large amounts of star winds .
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a bra@@ king effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rotation starts to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each of the star by re@@ viewing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star@@ ch@@ equ@@ es -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates points out that more slowly turn off more than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , and bigger stars are turning slower than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Bal@@ let &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ adas we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while fighting faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the observ@@ atory of the Ple@@ j@@ adas is so close , it serves as an ideal cosm@@ opolitan laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the observ@@ atory of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the How , When and why stars are slow up their rotation rates , and say to say their &quot; dance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ads , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won with the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract agreed him annually 27 million US dollars annually .
&quot; up to the end of the contrac@@ tions on 31 December 2017 , he will work in future as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
as a player paid it Rodri@@ guez long time with power .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for its teams ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed to create some milestones . &quot;
with the Hall of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ F@@ ame Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays assign only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely not likely to be absorbed by the 41 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field was , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the Super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; was to have taken place between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed due to a winding in the so @-@ called bio @-@ trial sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main @-@ speakers to have been received for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I have performed twenty years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez then sweet . &quot;
even his f@@ arewell days did not go straight .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit frequently on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , li@@ king @-@ acquain@@ tance of fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 @-@ defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team . &quot;
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first thing inci@@ dents &quot;
&quot; knowing : because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ test , weigh@@ ted weigh@@ ty Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio do not start . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
an inherited Ath@@ os could have been almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh day , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ inci@@ dents have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish weights were tested in Brazil and excluded immediately before the beginning of the anyway critical athle@@ tics competitions come these news at the time . &quot;
&quot; during Ch@@ en , Ch@@ en has been proven the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mask tool for dop@@ amine instances . &quot;
the International Sport@@ s@@ estate CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time to exp@@ ulsion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , they missed the Bronze Med@@ al . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the cycles of 50 m Fre@@ est@@ l . &quot;
Ch@@ en has filed an opening of the B and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and demanded of Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation with the investigations &quot; &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will work together with the International Sport@@ s@@ estate CAS , and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is not responsible for the sanctions of sanctions with positive cases . &quot;
also at night of Rio se@@ ated the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by the 33 @-@ year @-@ old thus went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act on the substance of the EP@@ O &apos;s blood @-@ offering . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample also has to be positive . &quot;
Bulg@@ arians &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w announces itself immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ os too Word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said he : &quot; &quot; we have been under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all weight the@@ orists is allowed to take part in the chron@@ ically @-@ offering nation in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was known , the London Olympi@@ ad in class up to 85 kg was tested for three days before positive on the an@@ abo@@ le ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both are disp@@ uted , but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athle@@ tics base , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is a further difficult blow for the rep@@ utation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the world @-@ association IA@@ AF had forbidden the complete Russian team up to an exception because of system@@ atic D@@ op@@ ings , which is also produced in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , the former inter@@ acting in China also had taken care of fierce disputes between the athletes . &quot;
this makes the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese olymp@@ ic Sun Yang hard .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple .
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ est@@ l , I will commit myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was at the heart of a dispute with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for intelligence sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positive in 2014 at the Chinese Championships positive to the stim@@ ul@@ ans tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a dre@@ on@@ ati@@ ge lock . &quot;
Dat@@ ast@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ ress h@@ acker her ran@@ som
programmers from Er@@ press@@ ungs @-@ Malware are currently targeted companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey conducted by the m@@ alware experts Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ ey@@ ed firms in the past twelve months were at least once , partially several victims of an attack with black@@ smith software . &quot;
in Germany almost 20 per cent of the companies have already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 percent of victims paid will@@ ingly the ran@@ som demanded by the perpet@@ rators to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators specialize in their black@@ ma@@ ze software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attack on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially poison@@ ous ran@@ som falls much higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of poll@@ ut@@ ant software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then we discovered the perpet@@ rators of the express software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the past months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware operates after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it looks targeted at un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encrypted the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
then the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail@@ ers .
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need to be money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ tion Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users use the personal photo database on the game , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down . &quot;
accordingly higher the damage falls off if a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
&quot; 22 percent of the German companies affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to complete the business activities completely , in one case people were born in life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany already several hospitals were victims of attack , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals . &quot;
&quot; we say the sacrifice always : pays not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers it is difficult , given the stand@@ still to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ secure the commercial conquest and the contact with the pres@@ ets examined and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; you declare your victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct @-@ accessible support websites or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and will be redeemed from a few hundreds of Euro by a few hundreds of Euro , companies need to be tough to negotiate and five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mailing , the h@@ acker is getting professional and share the work , explains safety experts from Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their poll@@ ut@@ ants then in the form of a software building to the actual pres@@ ser .
&quot; the m@@ alware K@@ its were created by the m@@ alware themselves , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is a custom@@ ization tool , so smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the pres@@ pres@@ ser then look for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; so , one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on multiple PCs . &quot;
payment is made per in@@ fi@@ zi@@ ed host .
&quot; usually over@@ wear the crimin@@ als with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
&quot; more than 50 percent of companies responsible in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey , trust the Ran@@ som@@ ware using File @-@ Back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful awakening , the perpet@@ rators are instead associated with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damage potential is higher than before the type of data to be a multiple times higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators could also take completely new objectives on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researchers , as they could have been able to get a thermo@@ stat under their control with the Internet . &quot;
in the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heating could possibly be worth a ran@@ som .
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators then instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ p@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V affects the passengers both in the first row and in the F@@ ond , there is no place at any point . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is falling somewhat . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V at the storage box .
&quot; it is not just a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ made and 10@@ 26 l at high @-@ made back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , when it sounds : the seat areas of the back bank can be up@@ loaded and thus offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to the ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the luggage space can be loaded well , however the charger height is 650 mm slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to torque range of up to 300 Nm in wide turn@@ key areas very powerful .
however he is likely to make his work a little bit qui@@ eter .
pleasing is the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there are yet another motor@@ isation : a 1.5 @-@ l @-@ gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; the equipment is open to the top &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; in the tested top &quot; Executive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; among the security systems , the City @-@ Not@@ brake wizard ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and the spinning assistant . &quot;
&quot; the collision war@@ med sometimes , because he has been rated by the ran@@ ate many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ying objects . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works on the teles@@ cope .
and the intelligent temp@@ o is responding to the traffic detection and th@@ rot@@ tle when needed the speed .
&quot; but the full connectivity is available only for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are among the arm@@ rest and are therefore something aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , receives the gas@@ oline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro . &quot;
the motors meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ exhaust standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : over@@ throwing on air bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; because a liability is possible only with dangers that are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken down a knee @-@ rise with the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happen everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the judgment . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease cases : when paid the organis@@ er
&quot; after their trip , after their trip only money will get back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful to be found in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests have proven the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the well @-@ treated case , a family on the second day of their door lou@@ der was hard to diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the whole vacation in the room .
your illness led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back on a defective frac@@ tal back that allegedly had poll@@ uted the sea water .
&quot; the family was the view , the journey had been faul@@ t@@ edly - and mour@@ ned against the organis@@ er . &quot;
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the frac@@ ture in fact was defective .
but the organizer received only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
&quot; he has not violated his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the rehear@@ sals of water no contam@@ in@@ ants were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - wom@@ ens through infection among themselves - belonging to the general life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 erk@@ ran@@ te .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , following the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about other attacks . &quot;
the state must be n@@ ish and decided at the same time react to the terrorist attack .
certain is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and split .
this triumph we do not give the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , the level of safety and strength also gives the consent of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , plans to implement the proposals up to the Bundestag in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; he also announced another personalised strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ first @-@ scale order over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ etic for terrorism must be back under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapons of the weapon must be so remote , especially the purchase of weapons in the internet is complicated . &quot;
the last much discussed silence for doctors should be preserved to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the stret@@ chers according to solutions , such as the haz@@ ard of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of mental symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ uting crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD chef Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , to contribute to improving the security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Justice have spoken clearly against shareholders .
&quot; that was one ear for the hin@@ ge in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship previously rejected .
a generic prohibition of the whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ ing hold it for constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; it cannot offer everything you want , and I rest the wearing of Bur@@ ka . &quot;
they could talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses against court .
&quot; green @-@ boss in Simone Peter raised the Minister , he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror pack@@ ets and in@@ capacity . &quot;
left @-@ convention Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet sp@@ amm@@ ers and a sharpen@@ ing of the residence on the right bring people in this country no longer security . &quot;
better transportation of traffic on the motorway
check out regularly on the road track - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this shall change : the rule of law is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all cars that are driving traffic on the ambient street every evening in st@@ au , when they drive over the highway ( A 43 ) . &quot;
the state of the street is extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the exit Wes@@ ale street the right @-@ in track around 700 meters .
drivers can then be influenced directly from the hammer street on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early on , thus reducing the total process on the multip@@ lier section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the districts of the representation of Münster @-@ West .
the rail system on the feeder is nervous the mot@@ orists mainly between 17 a.m. and 7 p.m .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes even beyond . &quot;
this is the reason that the needle is located at the B 51 shortly before the exit V@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic can only be split over the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be rec@@ eded in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had yiel@@ ded that the bridge no longer has the required load @-@ strength , in order to record especially the heavy duty @-@ traffic bil@@ ing@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related st@@ agn@@ ant will last , the competent authorities cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to count : for the bridge has an official remaining duration up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal remedy , the country @-@ owned firm has chosen the busi@@ est time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic is guided on Tuesday and Wednesday at the site .
intercultural journey : culture offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The Inv@@ isible House . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the young theatre are now planning a musical project .
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s association allows young people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The Inv@@ isible House &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre @-@ Münster . &quot;
in the context of the N@@ ima &apos;s initi@@ alled &quot; Intercultural Jour@@ ney &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the st@@ aging in the small house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background to visit schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and were little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the choreo@@ graphies , the s@@ wir@@ ling pictures and video anim@@ ations it had been possible to follow the course of action nevertheless , so the press release of the boy Theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wes@@ ter@@ berg from spra@@ kel , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musician project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years receive the opportunity to visit professionally , dance , acting and music in the fields of singing , dance , drama and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre and the@@ atri@@ cal language agency are in the planning .
the project &quot; Intercultural Travel &quot; continues .

rain instead of star @-@ sn@@ ail : hope of weather
the weather made the star @-@ sn@@ ort Gu@@ ck@@ ers in the southwest of Germany at night for Friday a d@@ ash made by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night because of clouds and rain had been bad for it to observe the heavenly spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory World z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we certainly see lots of star @-@ sn@@ ail at the sky . &quot;
&quot; it is per@@ ched by per@@ si@@ ps , which belong to the fastest star @-@ sn@@ ail with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they seem to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against ins@@ om@@ nia
&quot; in the evening , one is getting around forever , in the morning you get a few hours off , in the morning there is no more to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , you are with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult dormit@@ ories and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently recovered . &quot;
how can sleep or sleep disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of ins@@ om@@ nia , and there are many causes underlying to them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ iss@@ al , the member of the German Society for Sle@@ eps and Chocolate Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand it is , but the In@@ som@@ nie , so is an input and un@@ sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; just that le@@ athers many people as uns@@ atis@@ fying or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Managing member of the German house association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind ins@@ om@@ nia ?
the causes of ins@@ om@@ nia are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , mental or verbal factors , but also medications are stuck . &quot;
not rarely is the ins@@ ect expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early wake up is mainly due to depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ ar . &quot;
and it may be that different factors would like to face .
&quot; who , for example has a band@@ attack , can be bad , wake up all two to three hours and begins wom@@ an@@ ew to p@@ onder@@ ing above all day @-@ day problems and provide , there is We@@ ar an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should one be with sleep dis@@ rup@@ tions to the doctor ?
&quot; who is not well asleep over a period of a month in at least three nights per week , and the day should be imp@@ aired , should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is tired , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has vo@@ icing oscill@@ ations or bodily ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate the sleep disorder , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic sle@@ eves only in exceptional cases and at the most for two weeks - question . &quot;
&quot; low @-@ sunk fri@@ es in Germany is hardly stressed in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary , medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should first turn to sleep problems at the time of sleeping . &quot;
&quot; this can be clari@@ fied with examinations , whether the problems have a physical cause . &quot;
&quot; who was supposed to go to sleep laboratory , and what has happened there ? &quot;
&quot; for examination in the dormitory , medical research , for instance with snor@@ ing with respir@@ ation , in case of sickness , or if you find the cause of a diar@@ rhe@@ a disorder , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you don &apos;t need to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a mid@@ day , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after glu@@ ing you go to bed at his normal time .
&quot; in addition to the electrodes in the body , one gets a nas@@ al envelope , a chest strap and a antenn@@ ae on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is shown on the ceiling . &quot;
how can those affected the problems get a handle ?
&quot; there are quite a lot of pitch , in which one can put a better sleep . &quot;

the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself through Facebook to the disap@@ point dra@@ fting of the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he brought gold for the first time in Doha and simultaneously presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler placed via Facebook guard against his in the criticism of the ex @-@ team @-@ mate .
&quot; in a country where a Olympic winner gets 20,000 € pre@@ mie and a jungle heads of 15@@ 0.000 € should not wonder about lack of medals , wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night to Friday on his facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls is very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries which promote very much and do not see this carefully or operate this issue . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here controls are to be set , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ vers had already reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how one should keep it with countries .
&quot; who cannot be controlled at a certain time before the World Cup / OS by independent Contro@@ ll@@ ers of W@@ ada / F@@ ina , may not take part , &quot; the election of Hamburg @-@ Hamburg , which now operates an ice cream . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ h@@ eben takes place
professional Di@@ ebe at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; civil liberties of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded on Thursday the detention of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the Tat@@ ch@@ asti@@ se had committed to a number of hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs and baggage .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 , civil officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf was again a ban@@ ana again known to the police officers from past theft steel . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the mid July of this year , and were very professional and very professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crimin@@ al@@ commission@@ er 34 can diver@@ t the th@@ iev@@ es , who had traveled to Germany , four acts . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had taken a total of over 15.000 Euro . &quot;
&quot; built alt@@ ars , a couple of Lin@@ den@@ o@@ is@@ sions , a few lin@@ den@@ ies : the Rig@@ a@@ er Road in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in effect has not been seen at first sight , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; along the road from east to west , one gets along the play@@ grounds , a fresh@@ man kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the façade of a gray house someone is ugly ! &quot;
&quot; compared to a li@@ d@@ l , which is also soon demol@@ ished , is already built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the responsible property company Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in calls , are preferred in the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants of ten@@ agreements , on the ground floor are still open spaces and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year the Berlin cour@@ tro@@ ator H@@ enk@@ el had spoken several times for a tough action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on June 22nd , the rooms were given on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolled parts of the street , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , per@@ ched parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later the police and builders under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peaceful : parents walk along with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others entertain yourself vor@@ y Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; lef@@ tist force is not the main concerns of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been living in the p@@ ines since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * who attracts three children here , above all by the police presence of gener@@ v@@ t . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising mi@@ dd@@ ling and gentl@@ eness .
it does not sound like a pine @-@ country protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , that of the Berlin Interior , and the police between domestic and their neighbours does not exist yet . &quot;
&quot; Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which also has a low average age in comparison to the rest of the city and has a high degree of poverty . &quot;
also domestic projects and the native housing projects have been a long time ago for the p@@ ines : in 1990 numerous homes were occupied in the former GDR , including almost all the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was abandoned under large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied twenty years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : with them , people from GDR @-@ times and former land@@ lords were their p@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; this also makes itself noticeable in the mi@@ sts , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on @-@ made discs , or freshly harv@@ ested facades , which were be@@ aten with paint spra@@ yers . &quot;
&quot; no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason being that not all neighbours could see that as a problem , they might not necessarily be affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences like body violation , according to police officers , according to polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most part of criminal off@@ ences make est@@ damage , which tends to be rather the re@@ builds and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; in case of violence , it is essential : people in the 94 are their neighbours , who certainly not have been . &quot;
also the famous burning cars give it straight to the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , their road is not a crime fire@@ point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
New@@ geb@@ auer has become aware of the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and remained .
&quot; therefore , it was also so important for the inhabitants to return its road : from the police , politics and the media , which in July each suddenly claimed the interpretation of the borough . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : through sigh@@ ted new buildings in former builders who supp@@ ress the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are , ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums , who are not interesting for many here - here you live more people who are not so well praying , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I be absolutely non @-@ healing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what should you do , if one never stops someone ? &quot;
&quot; there is frustration on all sides of frustration , even in the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for those drawn upon color bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the home@@ projects and the left scene belonged to the p@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; who goes , should be aware - just like anyone who runs in a pub quarter , there can be bad about noise . &quot;
all persons named first and asked to not be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact in matters of integration and organizer .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
the Social Educ@@ ation@@ ist supports the team of management for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact person for all players : refugees , labor and refugees , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer of the labour @-@ circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the li@@ a@@ erial W@@ oll@@ us@@ f@@ sau , which is above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in such a way , some - less sp@@ aci@@ ously as rather on the variety of wishing to @-@ do areas , meant as the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; we were looking for administration with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a mi@@ tig@@ ate wool . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes , as well as networks . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent job for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le , and full @-@ official actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and insur@@ ism problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the washing @-@ road
&quot; a serious problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for connecting subsi@@ ding , which have been recognized . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
you must accomo@@ date the refugees in their own or rented apartments .
the costs for the construction , rent or refurb@@ ishment of these accommodation must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from Land@@ rat@@ chet on the Commune and job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
&quot; so far , do not work so far it is dependent on private apartments , so your eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments have to be visited as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing @-@ road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed bond , there are intern@@ ships , training courses , training courses , one @-@ Euro @-@ jobs and arrangements for refugees and migrants who need to be folded or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good &quot; , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , do non @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very tidy , like Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact .
&quot; that is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean work .
&quot; the day use a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a lack of feeling .
&quot; so we need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so we also jump into administration and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you have to explain the refugees that it takes and it can be useful to bridge the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling he could not work in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t work and be un@@ sel@@ fish that will never be integrated . &quot;
the marked majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are also a problem , however , says the customer to be honest , &quot; &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer therefore always be to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all that is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two after the recent conception of fear of radic@@ alization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what some more nai@@ ve can name &quot; . &quot; a balance can be could , but does not want to close it out . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed the hel@@ per is already .
these inci@@ dents are also the subject of the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely into call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with this , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main - and volunteers must remain on site and in the region to follow activities . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
needs Germany a ceiling ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , then the policy h@@ ind@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also clearly demonstrates that the Ur@@ bacher are already out of the fact that the previous people are able to be able to integrate .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Schor@@ n@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ary with helicopter looking for

&quot; for this , the police demanded several stri@@ ps , as well as a police @-@ helicopter . &quot;
the ground@@ ing was running without success .
&quot; eventually , the unknown before the apartment fell close to the apartment or at their escape . &quot;
