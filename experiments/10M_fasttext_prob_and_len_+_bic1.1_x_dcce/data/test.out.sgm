<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps economic policy compared: it's all about money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - you want to both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a principled, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to punishes the economy to death and regulate death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"himself on the other hand, he would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively return regulations, and he is strong for a wide tax reform with a lower tax rate - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton in contrast, says: the state has certain duties to fulfil, he has disadvantaged chances and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes would be increased for the rich, she says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton almost wortate."</seg>
<seg id="14">Democratic Appenin announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the nationalistic Teaparty-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, at Trump you could come to internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">More evident are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and again high coal production in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris mitigation agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in contrast, Clinton wants to expand and demand the renewable energies with its investment program:" a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazide Trade Agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US do not want to isolate the international trade - but just to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should then also be paid better, calling about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7.3 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not entirely clear: once he says, the minimum wage has to rally, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and its citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him before, so the household deficits would be even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who would like to ask at least the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is one of women, who alone will flee, almost already for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women sitting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby to be at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid their little son in the arm.</seg>

<seg id="10">Until they notice that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">It smiles short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the business leader of Condrobs, a carrier of social assistance offers in Bavaria, and deals with the topic women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Münchner north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for allotted women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs established the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich's contribution.</seg>
<seg id="18">"since then, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there any - even not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is an waist in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: any woman who arrives here, has made her escape experiences with sexual violence," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as a hopper for Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for women, other reasons for escape:" many steal themselves secretly, because they see no other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, Honor, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act, is not a rarity."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, tells."</seg>
<seg id="31">"again, all the women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worse if abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the Munich's north, are traumatised, it appreciates."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not optional."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to that they have nothing to say.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't trust openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often do not help you know, they need more accommodation only for them."</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven District governs are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction area, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken there are no such thing in the governments of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Schwaben, women were not separated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, basement and medics, there are in some common tables or own homes, only for all-related women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that was published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are separated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing or become men and women together, it can lead to - continuous violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, washing rooms should be easily accessible and accessible for women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel of this protective need, one can read at the Andjath who gives it to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been around for us, we have a long queue," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: a "Alliance of foreign parties"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to announce an official end of the eight months of ongoing war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponents in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in receiving, I cannot grasp the impression that Ankara wants to bring this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the towel, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smiles, tasted Allied and he hardly glowed heat, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke to his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count it.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day he described a newspaper, that Erdogan would have heard such as would never happen anything worse."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin pointed out a radiant, sustainable coolness that the President of Russia had nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory speech: the shot of a Russian fighter is on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow from response to time was awake.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Putin distributed and accused Ankara, Russia in the back."</seg>
<seg id="16">The offense was even bigger because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the Vetroman will rebuild again becomes difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months long, the state-controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once it seemed like the Turks, to blame for all the guilt."</seg>
<seg id="21">"by the serious officials, the allegations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria could have been controlled by the so-called Islamist state."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg the official message sounded, that it is time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received by President Erdogan the excuse he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of a ceasefire are clear on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan requires first and foremost all the friends that he can get after spending the last month at a failed coup.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions did not hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel insurance and charterers will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late season of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week predicted the state-television, cheap fruits and vegetables, once the Turkish agrarian imported again to be allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vdemosti shaped it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an extra political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry to the West since it is reaction to the tried power of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continuing coll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin will come out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey and the west."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state-president won a bonus from Ankara in Ankara that he would have requested support for the elected government organs in Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-evident for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep-sitting fear of regimes."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this glittering palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one as it once described a analyst once described the" Alliance of foreign parties ": two countries who live from the West and are badly addressed and now ignite."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, in spite of public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey assist with opposing pages."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both President said at the press conference, they would not even have taken this issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey avoided it clearly on a question about her differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect Disaster, as NATO member Turkey discloses the Russian Kampfjet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="8">"born 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his degree at the renowned State of Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it says (in Russian) that he later was the protocol manager and the leader of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">About his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">"I think it is the most important task of the government, to support your activity as heads of stature, and checks for the implementation of your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin distributed the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov asked for his post and I recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, claimed both men that the Stabernef returns on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smiles for the cameras, here are only few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is no one that knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official assertion - that a man who was once able to lead to as potential president, at once the Russian environmental policy should lead to great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "Ivanov" "it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining about four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been Chairman of the Russian presidential system for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Council KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Council (FSB), which was appointed KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputies."</seg>
<seg id="28">"as Putin, he called his power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most familiar."</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was believed that Ivanov came to the second term president of Russia as a third term of Putin would have rejected the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally to Putins, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he was elected president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green my: investors should become much stronger in the future in future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD is proposing a" "action concept" "next to the next meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all it is about the question: who will actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"vice-president of Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, to show up 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can also occur in the inventory.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the great defense point in the city hall is, however, as violas:" how do you deal with investors, who want to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of dwellings are building as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban construction program, which will cost millions of costs and will still be financed to incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, such as Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the political groups. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left still wants to print runs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of the, as viola, the bullet itself become a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the action concept will be implemented, which will ensure additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the program is not entirely wholly: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compare the loss of some 1,300 cheap apartments whose support will be run over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">Only up to 2020 will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planing-policy speaking at Nicole Palm, should now be buked out-up ties of the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"furthermore, all of them would have to be thought to get back again in the pricing."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West city.</seg>
<seg id="26">On one stroke will solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the western city the end of the year are running.</seg>
<seg id="28">"around 1800 apartments, one could get back to the price list for cheap apartments."</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"for the number of social housing in the West city is dramatically increased, it is removed from the purpose of so-called mixed-interference."</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social-weak in just a few districts there should be no more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens therefore expect that there is still movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go to the boat."</seg>

<seg id="9">The launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>

<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>

<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people are close to hunting even new friendships.</seg>

<seg id="2">A british traveller underwent his immune system and throws in a serious examination - by reading some of the most narrower and ekeldest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel editor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk wiped his course on a Euro-Schein, a flush on the Piccadilly Circus, a flush with a draw base, as well as a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance ability of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of the check-in each object, he used to show a Luminometer for himself and to show us what he will let itself."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filtered under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, brought some surprising results of daylight. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to reject the flush knob of a draw base, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually are in a kitchen sultry more poor bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe Mr. Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria, as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately left nothing, what he read, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine, by the world traveled and peculiar as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to rail stations to the flush of restrooms, the task presented its immune system definitely below a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told me:" "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to cater to his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he did, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">Its probes-line showed a runner-speed of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to that, the lamometers are fresh-washed hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to go out, after their loometers more than 4000 units was, while freshly washed hands one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of persons in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "This is the worst thing I put in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will find nothing here because there is indoors here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valid.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company features Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestine bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valid Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer the consumers really something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to view and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we led crazy brainstormings, which ended we said" "Come to us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">Also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the directing of the film, added:" I have lost me so - I could have had my respect for Ian, if he would have noticed some of the things I have relieved him, just like the ekelective Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to them, they punching and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad we received some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey carried out from the year 2015, 84 percent of all respondents made in lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they are used at least occasionally products, the attached lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men aged middle-age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you commit to the commentary box, to oversow him under the pseudonym of non-allotting men with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multiplicity of sound plates do not want to be to an boom in millennials, who want to welcome the reunification of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"those who have recently bought a record, all predictions are between 45 and 54."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older cabaret retain their feelings rather for himself (56% vs. 53%) and enjoying it to spend their own time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest gray approach, and wild, before I steal, my hands hold and something like this:" so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart Sohos is slow down to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now replenished the buildings where once independent seller were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic turnout stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the camera to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess her age and vegetables through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I followed by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men aged middle age) into the Reckliness Records (data number: eight men middle age), a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already treasure," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this record, pictured (he sent me the snapshot by email, I am not followed him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of its available income: it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and other items that he sold, when he was young and pleite."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I was probably something too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who are buying plates, are more introverted and like to spend their own time, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my push.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25 who works at Sister Ray also believes that many customers who meets he meets the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard from the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and to be prompted to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"by the talks I have led, people usually have been doing so about 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica, to realize that record stores a soothing community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers took impetus to the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull themselves back to the stability of familiar sound disks, of objects, the blissful Jugenders."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of solace," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "one employee of a record stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people, the last month bought a record, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey took also out that 41% possess a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who purchase a record, do not have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the message I would probably look very concerned, while I was petalled by a stack to Bossa Nova complicilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works in sounds of the Universe (data number: three men aged by middle age), has noticed one" trophy "of the cage."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone only arrived here recently and said," I do not own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead soundplate, so that I can put it into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less music-sharp."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, who are slow to come."</seg>
<seg id="44">"lop that has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists, the photos make teenager and women aged middle age."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops, Wild Beasts of synthesizer- and sexist Pop instead of experimental jazz from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks doubtful, but naecological psychological traumas are hard to be ascertained if one is standing next to someone over 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around for several minutes in the shop and looked at the variance of the available plates."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a manortal than a large one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from one computer or another way, but the beauty of plates is... it drives with a dearest sigh."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said that a new generation of bike lovers is said: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the voucher to muting the jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenagers, which for a moment to ask for Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter should be superior to buy one crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some are so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, even the one that is most suitable for luxury items like records."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research was erging that the results of YouGov vote, let them, at least in records in Soho, the large number of female collectors and a record-husband, who exist in reality, records and online content."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the strolling through plate of Berwick Street and the sheets by plates, while they steer the starring of an unneal, 30-year-old moderator steer that protrudes over the shoulders nothing of middle age."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the impressive performance of British in the 7-he Rugby came in the finals on Thursday evening to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were taken into Rio with a result of 43-7 in the depot stage."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji erdivided a master class in the handling, side-stepping, post-up, line-up and roher strength to win gold - their first olympic aille of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was failed by the not too poor trophy of the silver medal - Britain fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they smote New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the finale."</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of it Fiji would have fought a 15-man team in the form of a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Brite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Chefcoach Ben Ryan, the former boss of England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost her playing at Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>

<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is so, as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while the GB is still unexplored."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB led fundamental changes to the half-time through and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, to Joshua Tuisova after a brilliant intermediate stop of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton launched a trial for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for long in favour of the South Moravian, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune."</seg>

<seg id="5">I am not belonging to people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>

<seg id="4">"it is, as if the olympic torch itself would be a burning strip, who is protected from wristband to swimmer to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not switch on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue in the Coffeehop, without having Simone Biles, Katie Leasy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is no logon Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman's warm with dimples, could possibly have been sent to Prime Time, being built to Prime Time, being built to Prime Time, Turner or even Fever."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline of gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not include any event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not commonly accepted: air pistol shoot, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the flippers and may not rule it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I might be humble arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline is already a olympic event since 2000 when it was in Sydney his debut, it was noticed the last 16 years so sparse that many those who wondered, did not know that there is at all a olympic art."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had succeeded until 2012, who made it to the final."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women to share.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds for the unresolved ear for a clownsSchool than those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoons trembling of his never to-end swing - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, the two sports that it is essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as the springboard."</seg>

<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the Ziellinie or the initial wall, but in the television transmission also a further cavity target: the world or the Olympic-ekords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the target-oriented pursuit is posh, admirable, even fanatical, and it is enough to even stir up a host to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when looking at these games as something cheered.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is up.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesting while clashes with the police were killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia exactly to break up?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the past few months protests against the government the country and spread themselves in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week of thousands of people on the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses made that policemen appeared on the zig-armed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the run-run videos about the protests, which probably are from the last or beginning of this year, show how security men young people hit with staves, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of the UN authority for Human Rights is now calling for an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this land and in future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, particularly in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands at the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendulum in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously emphasized the repression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with Dissidents effectively became silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that might change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and don't have any other options except to protest it breaks it off," said Seeberm Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopies. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all from the soil use up to the stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this tortured, controversial line demanded in June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less forced in recent years, the turbulence and could be armed again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of embittering after years of the forwarns are now exploded under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with social media as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even when the government leaves access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially with protests, so many people can still communicate via internet proxies that conceal them where they stay."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave that they gathered so too protraced.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons prosperied the Amharas, which are from ether predominantly Christian high-countries, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and in flat land-areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But also this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are doing under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the intelligence, and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former vine guide, was until his death at a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactic genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly embarrassed in it, early indications of dissatisfaction and use special officers to process opponent and to make them unharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic idea," "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analysis."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unattended reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopian, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety services rendered by the tiger-controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time, Ethiopia lived such a turmoil was born in 2005, after thousands against elections protested, according to the statements by analyst apparently deceived by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following sweeps many protesters have been killed, even if it was less than in the last months, and this time of unrest went over relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new pendulum train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month attacked promuling in Gondar, a amharish city, by Tigray guided businesses and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst tell the protests the US and other Western allies led to a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently rushed to make this base closed."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally breaks into an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr. Abdi," is a very thin walk. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland mostly come only in winter to surface finish.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return after an investigation on board the boat trip Sanna into the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good one at 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland only with 150 years grew.</seg>
<seg id="7">"based on the Greenland shark at the bottom of the Nordatlantiks, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, speeds up the five meters long animal on satte 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">This of longitude-shaped lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at any rate from a Greenland, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," comments Alexander Scheuerlein by Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means for vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the theory of evolution already assumed for a long time that Greenland may become stone."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only failed the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the skinny coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius they dive at the surface mostly only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">"about the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers know accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="17">"your time-pentago moderation they, when they comfy six animals with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot make this sharks anyway: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young iceble."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly hunt them sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the icmeeres and look carcasses that from higher waters down to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as Beifang from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long while the largest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14-method the linens of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelid is already created prior to the birth of the sharks, which the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie down after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons, large amounts of this radioactive carbon dioxide into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the length of 220 cm, the length of the smallest animal softens the ruler of the lens against carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland in its ruler, in contrast, had normal carbon-14 volumes, which is created by cosmic rays inside the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 centimeters long Greenland, during the record-shark with 502 centimeters even 392 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="29">"after the Greenland female only then regrew, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"because one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the cusp of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined, Grönlandhaie became apparent at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live especially in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland, in whose speck at the Nacken a 120 year old harpoon, was caught in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism also runs on savings."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and slowly slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"to keep warm up in cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume increases much faster than its surface, by which the animal has heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss from one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a grams of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the theory of evolution. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"in contrast, a very large animal should invest more in a long life against it."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers from Erpressungs-Malware are currently targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey conducted by the malware experts Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed firms in the past twelve months were at least once, partially several victims of an attack with blacksmith software."</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 per cent of the companies have already been the target of a ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid willingly the ransom demanded by the perpetrators to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize in their blackmaze software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially poisonous ransom falls much higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of pollutant software," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrators of the express software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the past months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware operates after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it looks targeted at unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims need to be money - mostly in the form of cryption Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users use the personal photo database on the game, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage falls off if a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German companies affected by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to complete the business activities completely, in one case people were born in life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany already several hospitals were victims of attack, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the sacrifice always: pays not, you only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers it is difficult, given the standstill to reject the demand of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-secure the commercial conquest and the contact with the presets examined and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"you declare your victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct-accessible support websites or decode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will be redeemed from a few hundreds of Euro by a few hundreds of Euro, companies need to be tough to negotiate and five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the Ransomware blackmailing, the hacker is getting professional and share the work, explains safety experts from Antivirus-provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within one week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is about three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software building to the actual presser.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the malware Kits were created by the malware themselves, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>

<seg id="8">"after on June 22nd, the rooms were given on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, patrolled parts of the street, with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site, perched parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94."</seg>

<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are elementary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist force is not the main concerns of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer has been living in the pines since 1999, and Jana * who attracts three children here, above all by the police presence of genervt."</seg>

<seg id="9">"we were looking for administration with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a mitigate wool."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes, as well as networks."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent job for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle, and full-official actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and insurism problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the washing-road</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem has been recognized for some time, apartments for connecting subsiding, which have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accomodate the refugees in their own or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or refurbishment of these accommodation must carry the municipalities themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from Landratchet on the Commune and jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, do not work so far it is dependent on private apartments, so your euschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments have to be visited as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing-road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed bond, there are internships, training courses, training courses, one-Euro-jobs and arrangements for refugees and migrants who need to be folded or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good", "reports Regine customer."</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house master, do non-profit work - and this motivates and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"that is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day use a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a lack of feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so we need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So we also jump into administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you have to explain the refugees that it takes and it can be useful to bridge the time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling he could not work in Urbach, don't work and be unselfish that will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The marked majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are also a problem, however, says the customer to be honest," "people, in which nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and customer therefore always be to motivate others. "</seg>
<seg id="47">All that is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two after the recent conception of fear of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "Regine customer says quite clearly," "what some more naive can name". "a balance can be could, but does not want to close it out."</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized the helper is already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely into call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main - and volunteers must remain on site and in the region to follow activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Needs Germany a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, then the policy hinded."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also clearly demonstrates that the Urbacher are already out of the fact that the previous people are able to be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
