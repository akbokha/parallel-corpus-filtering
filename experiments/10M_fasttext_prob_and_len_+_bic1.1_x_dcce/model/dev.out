the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as backing Te@@ hr@@ ines to destabil@@ ising policies in the Middle East .
&quot; but the meeting must also address the conflict with the Palestinians , and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the ongoing settlement of Israel and scre@@ am a triumph@@ ant will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal of Obama &apos;s promoted deal , deal about the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two further deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March he had been invited to invite the Republi@@ can Re@@ public@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress , who was taken as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this time an im@@ min@@ ent choice in Israel . &quot;
in a call @-@ blowing professor to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; in a call , Professor Sh@@ annon was represented with a loud voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; he was worth to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still live and probably excited , and he said , the family contact of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; in the house , officials found the corp@@ se of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s and a hand@@ crafted note that I was sorry , I loved Amy and she is the only lady who loved me . &quot; &quot; this was his letter from the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no reference that he &apos;s represented in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , which was already 300 miles on the school grounds , where he shot at the door to his office and killed at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University staff did the s@@ late at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he has made a fatal not@@ al sometime then .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life , when the police took him bo@@ ilers . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , the students and faculty to hide from hiding behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an image of what he &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators published by investig@@ ators at both En@@ den of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw an image of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
&quot; said , students spoke that they were on their lessons . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s died , he didn &apos;t have any history of force or criminal history . &quot;
he represented his written book in one of his written book in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he told his ac@@ adem@@ ical life .
&quot; both courses conducted in the department of social sciences and history , their faculty 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were several in@@ clin@@ ations about problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb , he also seemed a bit excited and nervous , as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; a different student , Mik@@ hail Sy@@ kes , told that he told him that he had nothing to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; he had previously asked the Delta State University for a treatment of health reasons , and said that he had some health problem . &quot;
in this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the university important that the promotion , for the Lamb , had worked so hard for him to represent no guarantee of an automatic route to an employment position as assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he know nothing about a conflict between Wilhelm and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
these are questions that he &apos;s no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus the police were later lam@@ bs when he came back into Mississippi from Ark@@ ans@@ as import .
&quot; before he could be arrested , sle@@ w with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber Pist@@ ole in the backyard of a house some a mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ ane Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why he went into this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
he &apos;s represented in the area .
&quot; he &apos;s represented in 2009 his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geo@@ graphy and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he proclaimed a doc@@ torate in the spring in Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the many years lasting friend@@ bs presented him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was then the woman &apos;s heart .
&quot; all girls shoot there when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Pre@@ stadt of Bran@@ don . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s were obviously quite some time together .
&quot; in the call , &quot; I had slain my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; you had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick building , which was adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she was 15 years ago experienced , but friends stayed and one daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
he &apos;s represented Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail started three years ago both on a summer race market .
they played together the one or the other .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a Bark@@ e@@ eper , and sometimes enter@@ tain@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near the Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s standing and Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s Night in the night of September 5th was finished , after he &apos;s finished his guitar and harmon@@ ical harmon@@ isation in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there were no evidence that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were on the revol@@ t and ice with each other .
&quot; my , they both had a good sense for jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the spring @-@ term seminar programme and specialized on American indigenous peoples and colonial history , &quot; Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , a English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the State of the State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the students Committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening the Delta State campus in Cle@@ veland received about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the community on a candle light celebration . &quot;

the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans carried to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police has now made , after he had shot the emergency , and that lamb was designated as his wife &apos;s call , but there is no reference to the fact that the two have ever married . &quot;

&quot; Secretary Ban K@@ i @-@ moon , his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the nearly five years of continuous conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Security Council asks once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and integrate negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Mr Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the br@@ ink of the meeting of the AG@@ M in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he de@@ plor@@ es that the talks in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; can make this situation un@@ solv@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ban said the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unit to tackle the crisis in Syria , which they proved to be with Iran in achieving a nuclear dis@@ agreement . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to fire him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ can try , Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys to drag it down , it has not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys listed by Donald Tru@@ mp in the two @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 R@@ ick per@@ r@@ ys leadership was given to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of which also won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he could fight in a general election .
&quot; but outside groups , like J@@ eb the Bush @-@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative daily group Club for Growth now recognis@@ es Tru@@ mp@@ s per@@ sever@@ ance and start to flow their dollars to overthrow it . &quot;
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pop@@ ular properties are turned by 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced its can@@ did@@ acy in mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l saw positive . &quot;
up to the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
&quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa confirmed last week , that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp . &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as a candidate .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; mad &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; Ben Car@@ son will say about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say , they were &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 per cent , which say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite was the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans sees Tru@@ mp@@ s tem@@ per not as a problem .
&quot; whereas Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters believe that the real temper@@ ament for a president have , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first al state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for the commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 per cent , that he did not have the personality to perform effectively his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not go to the White House p@@ asse , thus ABC / Post . &quot;
re@@ publi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; set their nests , hold re@@ publi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination before , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C , last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
that &apos;s a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money at th@@ ief Bush .
&quot; full disclosure , GO@@ P &apos;s voters in the past did not have the crystal clear crystal ball in the past . &quot;
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans had thought that R@@ ick Perry won the nom@@ ination , in comparison to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
nevertheless it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ constitu@@ ants can be plau@@ sible than plau@@ sible .
&quot; even if the Republi@@ can gathered around one of the other candidates , Tru@@ mp suggests almost everybody . &quot;
some experts indicate that the spl@@ attered field is likely to contribute to a chest &apos;s guide while the anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen of other candidates .
&quot; however , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other re@@ publi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp supports multiple support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ago , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , mainly Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ ef Bush 19 points and finally on Rand Paul , John Ka@@ yourself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ at @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who proposes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans tells that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey conducted by CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters , the Tru@@ mp support , say that they have stated their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much may happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said they are open to the door , to change to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; yet tru@@ mp &apos;s strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but sel@@ ector who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans also say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp in the subject of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp has been calling for two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; the immigration and fishing point in public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expres@@ siveness of Tru@@ mp are essential H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party and the re @-@ oriented efforts shall be damaged .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / post pol@@ l from Monday , six of ten re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp in case of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the lim@@ elight , it is run by Donald Tru@@ mp also . &quot;
the frustration of the government climbed up to new high@@ s .
&quot; at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters falls mostly through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans said in the new day @-@ day pol@@ l of ABC / post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register , Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ re@@ public@@ ans over the Republi@@ can in Congress are frustr@@ ated , by 54 percent &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; and 21 percent &quot; &quot; polite . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; however , the Bavaria , was defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they were brave , and in their open efforts but often to get into artwork . &quot;
the attacks were often introduced to the shifting of Douglas Costa introduced by the GM Douglas Costa which was rarely crossed by the earlier meas@@ ur@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ ov@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck left off at the right side than his f@@ langes from the right half @-@ field in the upper left box .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half of them was made by Robert Lew@@ k@@ owski .
&quot; first , as the Olympic @-@ storms , Brown hit the head ball from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct withdrawal , the ke@@ eper Roberto with the knee par@@ ted ( 3@@ 5th ) . &quot;

&quot; the World Championship has given green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; he said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky , &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he made K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the challenged Lew@@ k@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;

who smo@@ kes - has a higher risk to lose teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , proc@@ laim@@ s not only the lungs , but also the teeth , which lies a Potsdam @-@ long study . &quot;
good news : if the risk reduces the risk quickly .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth at early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ B@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , in case of smoking the risk to lose their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely , in order to lose the 2,@@ 5@@ - up to 3.@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major causes for tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the tooth , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis is smoking a risk factor , acc@@ entu@@ ate the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and dental loss can therefore be attributed to frequent dental infl@@ amed g@@ ums with smokers .
&quot; whether , however , smoking is also increased the risk of tooth decay either . &quot;
&quot; people who have heard with smoking could reduce their risk , but within a short time they are writing the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could last for ten years until the haz@@ ard goes back to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained rec@@ tor Thomas Dietrich von der English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; if one had to convince people of this , non @-@ smokers only , university manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
it is not smoking to smoke is good for lung and vessels and also leads to a good dental health at a high age .
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 per cent of the population ages 65 to 74 years are affected by dental violence , whom di@@ DI@@ E comes with . &quot;
earlier investigations have already pointed out that smoking is the risk for early retirement levels .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ cling the findings .

&quot; by TTIP , the largest free @-@ trade zone of the world should rise with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; the plans for re@@ forming the current arbitration proceedings occur in particular , that the EU states and the USA will jointly select independent judges for a new investment fund . &quot;
&quot; they should come to equal parts of the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to lift up against judgments .
&quot; so far , the procedures involved exchanged among each other on the arbit@@ rators , an objection to their judgments , were not there . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that the old IS@@ DS system in the matter of fairness and justice will not be trusted , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long run , they want to go on an international investment course in the long run . &quot;
there could also be clari@@ fied between Chinese companies and the EU states for example .
the investor @-@ state arbitration grants ( IS@@ DS ) especially considered one of the main reasons for the greater resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; traditional arbitration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by critics as a kind of parallel , on the company dischar@@ ging the tax@@ pay@@ ers , to enforce national laws or reduce costs of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act , the proposals of the European Commission are insufficient . &quot;
it is mainly critic@@ ised that the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) has not been critic@@ ised for the already tra@@ ded free trade agreement ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic Secretary of Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) exhibited the plans as a big progress .
&quot; the Commission considered essential points to mark the reform of major points , Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel in Spring with other EU traders . &quot;
the old system of private arbitration may be from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European company B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned that the pi@@ anos of the economy have been limiting the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized companies could thereby be dis@@ advant@@ aged it .
&quot; when the talks on TTIP are concluded ( Trans@@ atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , on Wednesday still unclear . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer lasting anymore .

eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is sitting on the stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; beside him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy and left Fol@@ der has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with Fil@@ z@@ sti@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is nearly accepted by Mr. Stev@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; he relates to various places that he is always inde@@ xed to the map , wor@@ e about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender songs . &quot;
where they were created and how it looks there in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens is considered priceless mad@@ ness .

&quot; this emerges the rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ ather@@ ed series : each of the 50 U.S. federal states should be associated in a row . &quot;
but already in 2004 and in the Rhin@@ eland was already a &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; and has a positive side of expectations .
Mr. Stev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him Gu@@ it@@ ar and Ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musicians will live back to the series in New York . &quot;

the album comes up into the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of the currently active music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens is then serving on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) extensive and extensive electronic processing pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but developed by programmed sequence or Be@@ ats , and plays with all kinds of effect and hall . &quot;
&quot; jour@@ ne@@ ying to some small clubs , the stage sli@@ des@@ hows here will be a colorful spectacle from Ne@@ on @-@ forehead and great fluor@@ es@@ zier@@ ender stages . &quot;

&quot; without directed to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician by the wide @-@ enriched album . &quot;
&quot; you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and could therefore throw the &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ny debut in the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n debut in the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister with excitement is expected
the new Labour @-@ chairman Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is scheduled to give his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ y and will be set for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of its six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon . his performance is probably scrut@@ ini@@ zed by the media and the Labour MEPs are very close .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also told that he could ski@@ pping a few sessions to leave them to their colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as she returns to his appointment as member of the Sch@@ atten@@ d@@ iner and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour president during the Sin@@ ce of the National An@@ them has prov@@ oked a memorial plan for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , and stands at the center of several front pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , not to sing the national anth@@ ems , has attracted attention to itself &quot;
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in respectful silence &quot; and he had recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ d@@ iner , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he addressed the Labour president to sing the National An@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow @-@ min@@ ors have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they were called for differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliam@@ ent@@ arians joined him as a leader . &quot;
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within the Labour &quot; St@@ ack@@ able &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n statements on the position of the European Union and the im@@ itation of profitability .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to put Labour modifications in order to eliminate the whole idea of limitation .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow - and pensions ministers , that the party is very clear , that it is only against the regional plans , to reduce the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour president , David Cameron , since then he has T@@ ory chief , in the last decade over the Disp@@ atch Box in the Parliament has been facing the dispute . &quot;
&quot; the Labour president , who promised a different policy approach , says that &quot; &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister has been confron@@ t@@ atively , and that he will refrain from &quot; &quot; stroke &quot; &quot; and the spreading with bar@@ gains and instead has made to focus on serious problems like poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers will represent him when he is not participating - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally seize the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; he was he leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was often linked to the policy of a &quot; &quot; barracks @-@ Theatre &quot; , &quot; which is often linked with the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister . but a few years later , he dre@@ amed that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; as it was first sent in 1990 on television , the questionnaire was viewed as the principal bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliam@@ ent@@ ol@@ iters , although critics have argu@@ ed , they have become a caric@@ ature and backed @-@ sufficient reforms . &quot;

pounds increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound rose @-@ like after data , which show an increase in the rise of the United Kingdom . in parallel to this , the FT@@ SE was increased 100 by the ministry &apos;s goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
between May and July the result would result without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2.6 % compared to the same pre @-@ year period .
&quot; this Agreement has been the quick@@ est , and increased assess@@ ments on the time of an interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the pounds increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was cl@@ oned until 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
&quot; FT@@ SE 100 Index was with an increase of EUR 1,@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap of 20 % after the tak@@ eover Offer of the Rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was made .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and bring brands like Bud@@ dies , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were certified according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods in Ri@@ chem@@ a 0.3 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales volumes beat all expectations and also shown that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry and re@@ inde@@ xed .
&quot; holders of Gl@@ enc@@ ore increased by 5 % after the mining plant said , that he was taken to $ 2.5 billion by share a share sales as part of his strategy of debt relief . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MO@@ N@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , in fact , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s has sold his assessment of the rating ratings to &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.@@ 1 % , after the sports event company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million . &quot;
the chef from J@@ D Sports indicates that higher wages may end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more tra@@ force in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this department force will yield the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that might mean there are less additional jobs . &quot;

he has taken care of anyway .
&quot; for the advertising in the fre@@ e@@ print of the Super@@ bow@@ ls he cas@@ hed three million , a two year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ impl@@ es company sle@@ eves many , many dollars on the bending account . &quot;

&quot; when J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , sta@@ unt one on the windows . &quot;

some say the hyp@@ e g@@ ull became too far .
others say that that is why it is just in the USA and the UK with its new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; place 1 .
&quot; bending itself , whose fourth album is said in November , will not be interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ Med@@ al brings Leb@@ eses on the potato idea
potatoes or don@@ ors ?
it is both - and in the potato rolls that has developed the Ol@@ denburg land@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay .
&quot; inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch potato , D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat together on a pilot . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster with a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; which he had seen on television by chance . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his shop has a barbe@@ cu@@ le , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; it is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea of the Lebanese Government has now led to the Federal Office in Munich in the meantime .
&quot; there , it has been protected according to the authority of the authority as a pre @-@ owned model . &quot;
&quot; as much meat and as much potatoes of sp@@ ears , al@@ h@@ ay does not want to betra@@ y this . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; it tastes still better , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;
even in its customers the culinary delights come well .
met@@ cash - Under@@ ground launches campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - De@@ an
cash sought to protect Ig@@ A @-@ Fili@@ val in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched an Under@@ ground &apos;s campaign to defend the market share of the Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of some 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; in Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Str@@ ong and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets strengthen ties with local food suppliers and rebuild the Ig@@ A brand by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands like Eis@@ manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who in Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples distributed and shop @-@ owner , the res@@ sed tickets for the South Australian football liga to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be publishing more details of its corporate strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale distributor is performing for food , alcohol and devices to its annual investor strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is much in the game , since South Australia and Western Australia gain almost 30 percent of Met@@ &apos;s Ig@@ A @-@ charging fruit , and higher profits than met@@ cas@@ or Ig@@ A @-@ network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purchas@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much greater share of market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to some 14 per cent in East Asia . &quot;
&quot; however , an@@ alysts as Morgan St@@ ley believe that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its initial markets is cut away around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away from all existing players , but mainly self @-@ standing retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er may lose 360 $ million revenue per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this predic@@ tion is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened at 25 stores in SA and 30 in W@@ A , and will achieve a turnover of 500 million $ and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and grocery store and in the quantities of Met@@ cas@@ hs high fixed costs , Met@@ cash would cost some 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the east States , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ on , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ sh@@ ri@@ tists are the most faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes that Met@@ cas@@ hs sales in food and food store increased by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 to 2.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 percent in 2015 will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading F@@ ond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash borrowed it from publicly on the comments made by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a manager of Met@@ cash went in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; el@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food stores , of about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which has an en@@ closing pressure on turnover and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , inv@@ ests itself and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ , sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ net@@ res in hundreds of products every week to improve and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores due to rapidly growing fresh food products and deliver a better choice of private @-@ label food . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s main business leaders Ian Mor@@ rice says that the awards are to be made and shop @-@ renovation programs to El@@ an , and hopes that the wholesale distributor will return to the growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Co@@ dd@@ akis is supported by president of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly .
Th@@ an@@ asi Co@@ dd@@ akis deserves more praise as criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Co@@ dd@@ akis was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; &quot; in the recent assault on his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gios and deserves his opinion of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; coconut blos@@ som , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always indicated as a &quot; special K@@ s &quot; that is marked by the in@@ famous confrontation of K@@ yr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters into the lim@@ elight . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ks and his opponents Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , whereby Har@@ rison had to hit him : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka could have struck K@@ yr@@ gios and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen , as he struck a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ amp released a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ dd@@ akis was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in order to place the second place in the single @-@ Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup final @-@ finals at the United Kingdom . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I was tigh@@ tened up , is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi has been drawn up a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he cr@@ acked a r@@ ack@@ et as he lost because of a struggle in the US Open , but he is not the first player who crus@@ hed a r@@ ack@@ et from Fr@@ ust with himself and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he kept in the US Open extremely well , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison , and so on , and I think he deserved a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around you , he has a great family around you and I think he was treated a little bit strictly . &quot;
&quot; he is a very late 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is trained hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision , K@@ yr@@ gios on the important preliminary decision , which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; shared decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team was completely focused on the competition and not all the press lines around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gios &#93; &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick felt very fast , what people like ather and Mur@@ ray took out . he goes out in the eyes of the public , and he &apos;s trying to support him , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . some time outside of the ram@@ p , in which it can just think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states not@@ ary , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary explained the emergency area and broke the south @-@ border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to get illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos followed by the border , when hundreds of migrants accumulated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials with indi@@ gn@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the people who had fled from violence , have stretched for an unknown period of the street between the two check@@ points of the countries and built up tents and settled down there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations went up .
&quot; as a polic@@ eman over them ho@@ vering , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elling ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police forces . &quot;
some were transferred in protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that &quot; &quot; it is &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that immigrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a conflict of conflict .
&quot; in the coming days of discussions with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a strict meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the Ministers agreed , however , to divide the responsibility for 4@@ 50,000 people who were inv@@ aded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that ultimately - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would charge further 120@@ ,000 refugees including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary didn &apos;t put his hopes on a coming campaign of Brussels or of his neighbours .
&quot; on Tuesday &apos;s emergency level in two southern regions , authorities gave more powers to get out of the crisis so that they could un@@ lock roads and accelerate asylum procedure . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country is also planning a bar@@ bed wire from its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after it ended a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; CB@@ S News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pr@@ isons in the competition , to create the bar@@ bed @-@ wire brid@@ ged between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for a number of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Viktor Or@@ ban has , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic migrants are seeking a better life and not war @-@ refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction with other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ wo@@ e , whom the government could build along the southern border with Serbia , for a crime . these laws also impose higher pen@@ alties for def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; because of the situation that arose from the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the notation , &quot; said governmental ator Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ ac re@@ por@@ ters in the southern City of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the military use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press at the border with heavy armed soldiers had already seen at the border with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people attempt to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
they come here by sh@@ ame@@ ful the fence ; they are now taking into custody and will blame the bur@@ ial of criminal off@@ ences for the new laws .
authorities are going to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian official joined the Tuesday morning in two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train @-@ wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos conver@@ ged the main border crossing of Ros@@ ary , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container , to process the data of people and thrust a crowd to sit down there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 I managed to arrive , but thousands were staying outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway association between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton anticip@@ ates prot@@ ru@@ des before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins and opposite the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now reached the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , by 27 percent ( rising by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; T he Vice President Joe Provi@@ des , who has not yet announces that he will receive for the presidential term , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; elections , more than five months before the beginning of the elections , say the majority of the democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion stands , what candidates are being supported . &quot;
but Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters are more ste@@ er than one of the other candidates in their election .
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a great advantage in both women and men , but that le@@ aps have reduced . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men has declined significantly , and otherwise it is only possible with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters has a 50 years time , and they are now on the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton had a great advantage with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton had a two @-@ digit head start with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders will now have a five point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the elections held country @-@ wide say they would support him with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter will support them with some precautions , and another 15 percent would only support them because they have the nom@@ inee as a candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly that Clin@@ ton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about it all from it .
the views are stronger at those who currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ as@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of elections can say that Clinton support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less re@@ publi@@ can voters this over their top @-@ channel data , Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ ker promises in an open question why they want that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it &apos;s time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that they have the best nom@@ inee for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
the Clin@@ ton supporters will also men@@ tions their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to the handling of problems and voters are also cited .
&quot; as the Vice President breaks out a potential for the presidential office on the scale , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are needed for the elections , whoever would choose the second election is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; at Clin@@ ton followers , there are more than half that Bi@@ den would choose their second choice far ahead . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den , not for nom@@ ination of the Democrats call themselves , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ker calls before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in competition on 30 points without it in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has declined from 78 per cent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; be@@ es is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage , who sees him as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ f@@ ist &quot; , &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a Candi@@ date , the Democratic voters ask questions about the constitu@@ tion@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as in the last month , not a single parliamentary candidate or a potential candidate for those voters of the presidential elections were considered unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates achieve good results in some important characteristics of the constitu@@ encies of their party .
&quot; ambig@@ ui@@ ties , Clinton , S@@ anders and Provi@@ des are considered honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong man@@ qualities . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds are the best with the three candidates best for honesty , while Clin@@ ton strength is the leader . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ sting , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think about it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the elections are generally Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions concerning Hill@@ ary Clin@@ et &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server in the term during the term , most Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in total . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; now half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no consequences for their general opinion on Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion had still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton became worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trusted by the constitu@@ encies of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered constitu@@ ents : only 32 percent do they see honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible visa were also tru@@ mp but not honest and not trustworthy . &quot;
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are however good notes under management .
&quot; the six candidates tested Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him . &quot;
&quot; the fault ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 based constitu@@ encies in the presidential election is 6 percentage points . &quot;
Ben Car@@ son approaches very close pol@@ l close to Donald Tru@@ mp .
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey conducted by CB@@ S News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp .
&quot; for the two candidates , half of the voters fall in the new survey , and others will lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters support nationwide tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support is of 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey , which was conducted in front of Fox news debate last month , at 27 % in survey about the Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son flow@@ ed in the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also highlighted that Car@@ son was well received by demo@@ graphic groups and Tru@@ mp are rec@@ alled under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is be@@ aten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , which is the deepest of the deepest , namely from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
the former Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush the former governor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located 6 % on the third place .
&quot; the error @-@ mar@@ ge in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % , and was conducted in September . &quot;
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , indicates that Car@@ son is increasing in the p@@ olls - he arrives with 19 % support in the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also pointed J@@ mp notably before Car@@ son .
&quot; taking a look at one of the last week of rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some side stra@@ in@@ ers for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son is ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask tru@@ mp tru@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
&quot; pleasant bathing temperatures : the Mediterranean sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm . &quot;
&quot; even if peak values are only measured in the distance , they can also find a trip to the Mediterranean to enjoy even warm water . &quot;
a bath in North or Baltic Sea might be a rather short pleasure in a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some of them goes no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the north and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German weather service ( D@@ W@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; with contrast , bath @-@ temperatures on the other hand offers the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt will come to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood to the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Neul@@ ings
&quot; nearly two years , after a student died in a single @-@ channel ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed , M@@ ord@@ ant positions are filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta Racing Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un , &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an examination , in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death , distributed the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been charged with associated eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally did some head@@ aches , then he was unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta company Brotherhood does not cry the emergency number 911 , having Den@@ g power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothing to contact his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Chris Wagner on a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , utensils have begun , and posed the good of the Brotherhood , in principle about the by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
he could not revi@@ ved and he died on the next morning to his wounds .
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ ha@@ vo@@ gue , Den@@ g was repeated with mu@@ te strength at head , torso and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood , at least one student dies for 1970 every year at the ra@@ ils , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for murder on the third gradient of the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ eight members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for serious attack and formation of a criminal organisation . &quot;
&quot; we do not just want to make responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or in@@ formally - this sanc@@ tioned , we shall also call them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood does its belonging to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a inser@@ tion height comes , and the household will fall into w@@ aging , ren@@ aming for bonds will rise , and the economy will gli@@ de into a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little instructions for the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first level of interest increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ vity of the Federal Reserve at the raising of interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in doing how the economy and financial investments respond . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US @-@ central bank have stressed so veh@@ ement that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather to the period that is required for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants may notice that the whole excitement was perhaps exagger@@ ated because of a check@@ up . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably made by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , boss econom@@ ist with Capital International , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level in order to be a se@@ is@@ mic shock that seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the prevention of inser@@ ting things may make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once the increase occurs , the impact is not that dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that financial investments are deduc@@ ted from 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analy@@ st in a newer study to what happens after inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in the last 35 years , the market has usually been last 35 years ( average profit of 2,@@ 6 percent ) , then back to normal rate after 500 days , with an average yield of € 14.@@ 4 per cent according to current analysis , Bob D@@ oll , chief system Str@@ ate@@ es at Nu@@ clear Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares are occurring later in the increase cycle and the return begins to l@@ essen .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but ten@@ ses promote it often .
the F@@ ed is in the current case the F@@ ed is facing some conditions before and which they could accelerate a recession .
&quot; not@@ e@@ worthy is the fact that the gross domestic product is being placed near its lowest point , on a inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to the Deutsche Bank , the 118 ac@@ qui@@ ties since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , only a few have to expect this will be expected to expect the third quarter after the Atlanta F@@ ed to only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ tions in such a fragile economic background can be risky and throw the question as if this is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants took place the whole year on a place inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many shr@@ ubs and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could give an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading is only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all enhancements made from 1950 to today in a super cycle with an increasing momentum in GDP has taken place and on pre @-@ conc@@ es@@ sion@@ ing summ@@ ed up very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; so the report . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , that the F@@ ed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this was so far 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ le because the market takes a place of inser@@ ting , and the pattern is quite similar as on the market market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; at bonds , the ren@@ ces appear to change the direction once the first increase in lowering is in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the enhancements cycle the bond @-@ duc@@ ed immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ist of Charles pigs believe that the rise in interest rates will result in , that ren@@ ching the gap between longer and shorter bonds will bring a closer look at the curve of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ rate bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious , higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ analy@@ sing at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates are rising , the earnings is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rows have been extended and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy . &quot;
&quot; over the whole company , companies that benefit most of their business activities in the USA will benefit , if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debt will be worse since an increasing dollars in their products will be more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react very positively to three months after an initial d@@ inning , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with a watch@@ ful balance after each of the board inser@@ tions in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percent . &quot;
companies with high capital re@@ perc@@ ents as well as low vol@@ ati@@ lity in their shares also met their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debts are a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will most lose , &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share of stock , consumers will also benefit by the rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; gains can see profits by higher yields , even if experts have different opinion how quickly it will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM Single Council President Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the Sender within his &quot; &quot; transgres@@ sion &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also critici@@ zed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its .
parliament &apos;s colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up the shipment The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; transforms into Classic FM , claims a leader in the executive and increases new pressure on the station to prove that he does not do anything that the private station does not . &quot;
&quot; Conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC bos@@ ses , that the publicly @-@ legal radio stations &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; and increasingly fail to distinguish more from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to transform into Classic FM &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also sent to the BBC Music Awards held last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , The Br@@ its appear to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate the im@@ itation , which is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General , dismis@@ sed the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals , when it comes to live music and intelligence . &quot;
&quot; what I learn of Radio 3 , I will not learn anything differently from classical music . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music which is truly un@@ rival@@ ed .
&quot; and to give the engagement of Radio 3 , new music and to give new works on behalf , I consider also really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that tougher to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; but radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire to step the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice of - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch manufacturer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
can you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced in a special BBC fashion .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; , &quot; if the next time it has an entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to give money by the amm@@ ers for other sub @-@ formats . &quot;
net sales climbed in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
during the first three months of 2015 there was seven percent increase in online sale .
in the last month the lowest result was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online @-@ sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed your expenses in November
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping has bow , and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into violin towns . &quot;
yet experts say that there are now signs of online rel@@ ays after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the recordings in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs of online sales after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales message to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he stated that online sales began more than three years ago , as a purchaser agrees with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is up , and we may possibly experience that growth is dimin@@ ished . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday @-@ phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as one reason for the subsequent renov@@ ations .
&quot; experts believe that buyers have their sh@@ opp@@ ings before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer sites cr@@ ashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers conc@@ ede for bar@@ gain , buyers from it could do some shopping . &quot;
a British Retail Con@@ sortium realized a little more than 1 £ online spending .
&quot; with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases is carried out via Web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online than in the dormit@@ ories in the interior . &quot;

&quot; if you can be able to deal with a hammer or a brush to con@@ ges@@ tion walls , today they appear to be a minority . &quot;
&quot; for the British increasingly employ craftsmen to perform hom@@ ec@@ lec@@ tic jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ronique Lau@@ ry , new business manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets , said that a large increase in number of skilled professionals from Eastern Europe , which offer services to free@@ zing prices have now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; hence , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops is planning to open themselves to arti@@ sans and close up to 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to engage more women in B &amp; Q shops since eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the shop are made by women .
&quot; at the moment , at the moment over@@ l@@ ull the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends , the more female single households , show more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; she is still working a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of all decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry that one of only five women listed at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed below has also men@@ stru@@ ed its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is nearly the only company that occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial leadership . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for the Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her rec@@ ted a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the attempts by the group paid the costs of the closing of the stores .
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q possesses , 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ I / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; at the national Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt , on Wednesday two functionalities of the Austrian volleyball dep@@ uty manager A@@ I / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and rel@@ ent@@ ment . &quot;
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them was also charged by ministers .
in May he was acqu@@ itted in May .
the current process has been postponed .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel have cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ investigation that the accused in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 accounts of club accounts , concerning which they were buried in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage caused by some 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports@@ men are also charged on account of financial deposits .
&quot; this fact , however , was the chairman of the S@@ op@@ en@@ sen@@ ats , Ri@@ chter@@ da Micha@@ ela San@@ at . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to consider the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence presented that the association has never emerged as a asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports activities had only been calculated to compens@@ ations for damages and for the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money from debt - the pas@@ sports w@@ resting in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( about 4@@ 4,000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : &quot; &quot; we continue the Club or block it ? &quot; , &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the Br@@ ot@@ an grand@@ master of the financial centre . &quot;
he decided to take on this task with his colleague and colleagues .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have prescribed money to keep our life insurance as a security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said in the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; had been agreed with the association , you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , with their financial - success the payout of the allowance was made retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the allowance is only years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus in the account had been paid out . &quot;
&quot; therefore also breaks @-@ in and not detail inter@@ rup@@ tions , the former Ob@@ lig@@ mann of the former Ob@@ mann was explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and statements managed by the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endants . &quot;
why the withdrawal from the club had not been detailed explicitly asked the judge .
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial stability , so it is only the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 against the an official investigation began with ministers of ministers , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the official bank account . &quot;
&quot; these were back , they said the def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; this securities account took place on the name of the second def@@ endants , and according to its statement the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
after that the respon@@ dent did not know a reply .
&quot; he said he said , he believed that this was the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known something of that money , the prosec@@ utor had placed into the room . &quot;
the co @-@ cl@@ esi@@ ed had been informed immediately to the function@@ ary .
this transfer has been formulated as &quot; claims &quot; .
why contam@@ in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know ri@@ vals and prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; in this statement , the first accused did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never caused a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do , if the lawyer says , &quot; With whom you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal couns@@ el ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the functional said , he has never related a pen@@ ny salary , he just reck@@ on them only o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; at di@@ ets , he took charge of 1,000 Euros per month , but the actual effort would have been much higher , he added . &quot;
it was not necessary for the early years to study precise documents for the early years .
&quot; these are after a running examination , in which everything has been judged as correctly , they were no longer stored . &quot;
mil@@ e@@ age had also referred to the second accused .
&quot; all re@@ per@@ missions are made in cash , so that he will have to drive from his place in the international marketplace to the Bank after B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings of the trial will be continued on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Tri@@ ps further 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition , for three years current human resources , the computer ri@@ pper will develop further jobs during the opening of the company . &quot;
the employment rates of the U.S. Competition H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not find an end .
&quot; in the framework of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group is planning to reduce the reduction of 25.000 up to 30,000 places at its corporate clients . &quot;
&quot; thus it shall be saved in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2,@@ 4 billion euros ) , distributed the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the move will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be cancelled from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; HP did the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 still approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

&quot; in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers fell by 1@@ 1.5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
thus the proceeds of 15 of 16 quarters were left .
HP is responding to a breakdown and massive employment rates for change in the industry .
&quot; the 76 years old company under the direction of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers , and getting more and more shops . &quot;
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan provides a total of about 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in hos@@ tilities in Iraq would decline to meet : 54 per cent spoke off against it , 35 per cent pointed out . &quot;
&quot; that other states will fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a co @-@ operation with the Syrian government but Bashar al @-@ Assad put 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would have been . &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence @-@ breaking time at ser@@ b@@ ish @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has inserted refugees at the Ser@@ b border with Tr@@ ó@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and throwing water against several hundreds of refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced the bor@@ der@@ ance of the border control point .

a group of refugees crossing the border .
behind it had a police guideline and behind the police officers was prepared a water light .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , posts and plastic bottles after the officials . &quot;
the officials first put away un@@ interrupted pe@@ pper spray .

time for decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US @-@ bank accounts on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , together to meet the important decision whether for the first time ever since almost a decade , interest are lifted or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Re@@ uters found that a little more than half that would do this , now that the F@@ ed will do this , now that the F@@ ed will keep a bit longer and the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent will keep . &quot;
&quot; it is a historic event because it is seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest placed on N@@ U@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank could possibly leave the zero region and start a process of norm@@ al@@ ising the interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , guiding staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ lli@@ on dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed can not ignore the lower rate of global conditions . &quot;
&quot; you have warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced by 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
mort@@ ail at the Delta State University allowed
&quot; after the sho@@ ots and killing of his girlfriend into Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he terri@@ fied his colleague on the Monday morning and killed later on the day he wrote to him &quot; &quot; I could do &quot; &quot; on the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it un@@ done &quot; , &quot; gave public authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he &apos;s lecturer for Geo@@ graphy and socio @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , called emergency telephone number from 10 : 00 am Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , he was shot to someone , and someone had killed . &quot;
he &apos;s represented by the employees of the emergency central question that police police must send police officers at his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I got my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but who will not distur@@ b &quot; &quot; but probably be excited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the police demanded the c@@ rested upon his name , but he didn &apos;t give it . &quot;
he has seen no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police ro@@ cked the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could und@@ o it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only wife who loved me ever . &quot;
&quot; the note of the note stood 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he served E@@ ane Schmidt , a professor for history , before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were killed him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he know nothing about a conflict between Wilhelm and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the company supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there are &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s was discovered by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who spoke , she had been married to about seven years as a &quot; good person &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were shot 15 years ago , but were friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s had a daughter who is 19 and had destroyed them in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s had his daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s worked online from home to statement by L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les that has been identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s .
&quot; we said that Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , he has met for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said expertise &quot;
&quot; the police said he &apos;s related to a certain point in the Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; as polic@@ emen him on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , later in this night , he &apos;s car at the side , ran into the forest and t@@ led himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s represented in the spring of 2015 , from the Delta State University , as the theme of his life on the website of the university . &quot;
stars that have lost their god@@ br@@ inger
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
the actor also allegedly had to fight with drugs and in 2008 he was condemned because of drug owners .
all this certainly calls for its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa breaks the Group by
the Lufthansa are planning a big concert of companies .
a half billion Euro in the year will save the Lufthansa requirements alone with a better organization .
150 of the around 1000 executives around the world will cost companies num@@ b in the workplace .
in the pilot trade union there is more of new negotiations .
the Lufthansa reduces its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the endor@@ sement Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the real@@ ign@@ ment of the real@@ ign@@ ment was a result of about 500 million euro per year from cost savings and redemption , sharing the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
among other things there is no more board of the board for passenger vessels in the future .
the che@@ ap@@ ing line Euro@@ wings sol@@ ves can be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
in the team of Chief Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings .
the new construction underlines the importance of Euro@@ wings who wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ Air and Easy@@ jet .
&quot; so far , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the tra@@ ilers sold under the umbrella of the passage of the airlines Air@@ line , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilot
in the tariff @-@ conflict with the cock@@ pit of the cock@@ pit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the judicial strike .
they divided the union with them .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement scheme for pil@@ ots .
cock@@ pit plans &quot; return &quot; into a year with an projected account result &quot; as quickly as viable results .
the conflict between trade union and air@@ line resulted in several strikes in the past few months .
background is beside the transition supply of the pil@@ ots the austerity concept &quot; Wings . &quot;
it shows that the Lufthansa in the fight against competitive routes to the Group &apos;s own che@@ ap@@ ing Euro@@ wings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play month @-@ days because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture in his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester .
&quot; while this def@@ ender proclaimed the left def@@ ender and close it out of games for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w is able to play again in this season . &quot;
&quot; the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15 minute , after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was built into the PS@@ V area . &quot;
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double banner @-@ operation and is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; it will be released tomorrow or maybe a day later , and then in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it very hard and then is fantastic and then happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it will last six months and he won &apos;t play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy to be able to escape a Red Card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ le .
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pen@@ ed the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian Ar@@ bit@@ ration had not mist@@ aken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself if I say , that an El@@ fri@@ meter and a red card was payable . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a we@@ et on Sha@@ wn account sounded : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more quickly . &quot;
follow : Manchester United is experiencing the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of PS@@ V
the England @-@ def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover from the European Championship in France until the coming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very worst injury . &quot;
when a player leaves with this kind of injury to the square they are all very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
&quot; Moreno suffered a leg length , as Mexico with Van Ga@@ al &apos;s team at the World Cup 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who was travelling in a different direction , so it looked , as if he had touched it , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 Moreno &quot; &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad for me . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - according to a F@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron wants to know his Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you almost complete it . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; asked as he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book decided to call himself the prime minister of The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ General Environmental C@@ ost of Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writing about Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it seems to have missed a picture or message that we have so far missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposedly introduces the action of the book , instead announced a content presentation of the film version of 2012 , the new characters and details were added to extend the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ take @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes to win a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss host@@ ages and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this is not yet susp@@ ici@@ ously enough , it is presented as a summary of the text of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the Internet Movie database , where anything is artificial and even the air a commodity is that hopes to win a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is yes to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the action of the book as little familiar . here goes an un@@ named boy , as the local environment by the cas@@ h@@ edge , trees , be@@ ur@@ red beings , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees &quot; , &quot; v@@ and@@ alised . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR @-@ task was deleg@@ ated to a care@@ gi@@ ver which did not read the Lor@@ ax 20 consecutive to a child .
&quot; Down@@ ing street Spe@@ ak said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons , constitu@@ tion@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; confirmed that the text by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees was delivered , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still hard
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you have selected the cad@@ res that has chosen England for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not make a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ look site might be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry a sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful and positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ ques Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an un@@ familiar size at test level is an option for the attack . &quot;
this message @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th separ@@ ates from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course , for me as his boss @-@ trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ Player is oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question mark when Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this , that players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he gets further rounds of Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his position , even if he did not get so good performances and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test fails gets to put his character , is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was scored nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do it home and reverse .
&quot; the only pro@@ ach that can be up@@ lift , was that England first put Jonathan on the Caribbean , - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , which I highly regarded . &quot;
&quot; it is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he reached 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge position , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; it needs to be at least the same opportunities as those who receive from him , but it depends naturally on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to let the mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would perform an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler , and four qu@@ icks would get , and I have nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer could not beat there , and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ s@@ l of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mosque may not be done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team colleague J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he joined in 2001 as Open@@ er . &quot;
he immediately made three hundred ranks and were not looking back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes inside the Ka@@ der as the back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he was very impressed as a young man . &quot;
people might see his statistics on - average 31 with the bat and 35 by the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt but there is no big number of back@@ ups who lift their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made England a few smart additions to the trainer .
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ón Com@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the testing games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys of the game , which will bring an abundance of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for International Cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights on which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys &apos;s team @-@ team at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , will not be used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and Team@@ armament do not determine the timetable . &quot;

such decisions will not be made easy to play .
the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = spin @-@ off Britain from the EU ) could attract interest in Zul@@ u when the economy operates in a flow rate until 2017
&quot; David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ postpon@@ ement strategy to keep Great Britain in the EU , will face deeper trouble with every day , even without the choice of the in@@ geni@@ y Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , cr@@ ashed on the Tuesday due to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at and said it said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ ails into various crises , such as the EU it has been and not always from their own fault , Britain itself created an agenda with sponsored con@@ fes@@ sions and interference @-@ based contractual changes that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Brigh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not even might je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; prime minister and Finance Ministers climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they will win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who would like to look for outside the UK in the inside of the EU tent - leave us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and will be amazed that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials came to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; German chan@@ cell@@ ed chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her as it is about exagger@@ ated ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande looks back on re@@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a black@@ out force .
Poland may soon be a nationalist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that it should be an evil to help out the sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent the energy better for ensuring that Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st trends have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , possibly some such ministers might even opt @-@ visi@@ bly not helpful comments , totally in SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , pres@@ et my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain &quot; &quot; has not gained any value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how tourism can be on its costs and what EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press , but not as they inspired it during the Tony Ben@@ n inspired refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms in 1975 , but not giving our entrance to 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they are also weak at Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who has made a name for itself as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade &quot; ban@@ anas in the early 90 @-@ 90 years . &quot;
&quot; with all his de@@ ity , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing Sch@@ ur@@ ken , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ wings , and the pseu@@ do non @-@ Indians , who have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair thought similar about it , but realized that if you &apos;re sitting with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage allowing better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of going for lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a militia was more bla@@ st@@ ri@@ cher than Blair themselves , when he rejected the constitution of the EU , since Blair had rejected the principle of the EU Parliament adopted by French and Dutch voters in 2005 which opened to it an back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never drawn it to him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly l@@ apse on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no more time for me to waste - but in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ boy@@ cott Mur@@ ray was at that time , a fault then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but it must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to gain the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I always express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; now , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ular @-@ tendency and the wil@@ der Ge@@ ys Klein @-@ english changing can probably say yes to any of these . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said , as the boy sc@@ outs appeared in him , to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a s@@ lat@@ ent rule was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ he years , when his old father bow@@ ed himself on television , to be loyal to his Labour cab@@ inet@@ ts@@ col@@ on without losing too far and to lose its Cab@@ inet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight in order to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s said - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , still what J@@ C told its fellow cli@@ ent@@ ers and Members according to all reports on their clause at the Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the era of TV around the clock and , above all , in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allowed him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the talk campaign for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as well . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins is sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ ui@@ ties to the EU membership - in accordance with its B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ements - its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ issu@@ s of small sub@@ stit@@ ches is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is sure that J@@ C does not start a campaign to resign@@ ation , foreign diplom@@ ats will be committed to try to find a sense of their supervis@@ ors at home in all . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin be wast@@ ing political capital , they also have mis@@ understood voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the U.S. is already pretty disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost coverage of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start on Monday by something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ised the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking occurred out of a meeting of 12 persons , partially with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined that they critic@@ ise the evidence of public Health England ( phe ) in her report about e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
&quot; p@@ hic published the &quot; &quot; Mani@@ fes@@ to &quot; &quot; in the past month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have asked the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and transferred to the links between a number of experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month reached the &quot; &quot; exceptionally wind@@ y basis &quot; , &quot; on the p@@ hic conclusion his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers are asked about BM@@ J and asked if the asser@@ tions can build on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public awaits the fact that &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &apos; on a detailed verification of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ expert decision @-@ analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to introduce their opinions on the damage of the various nicotine strength to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; said , Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainable report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants to the meeting agreed to get funds from an e @-@ cigarettes producer , but not funding which he intended to obtain reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered , but includes several known e@@ tiqu@@ ettes , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco line also took part in the session .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; adm@@ its &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products among most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ hic report . &quot;
&quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that there were no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes could previously serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at the p@@ hic , said that the claims of BM@@ J was previously responded to . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smoking dies in its addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggest@@ ing that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to that are low , but that we continue to have the long @-@ term impact . &quot;
&quot; p@@ hic has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence is proof , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative threats in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0.000 people annually die in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion £ per year . &quot;
&quot; the clear proof of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; finally abandon East@@ En@@ ders , says former manager of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should cease programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC to place publicly legal programs that probably will probably be seen by a smaller crowd , in hard cont@@ ested time window against the popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ itters like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried over six years in his time at Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs in order or sends , which would also clearly show un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broad@@ casting fee , what I do not hold in mid or long term , you should do its production at least on programs that do not make or order . &quot;
you send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to reach as widely as possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that no one would show it is a joke , it is ridic@@ ulous ; it &apos;s natural sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax financed programs which could also be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , admitt@@ edly both of their own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give your right arm to it . &quot;
I am trying to see me how this should be public @-@ free television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a business@@ man for series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 led , said that the BBC to blame in the hunt for reviews is &quot; due to the ambition of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC broadcast again , what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart at Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ U Programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they do not measure their tasks , and they can argue if they are going to their seem@@ ing missions to the justification of 4 billion £ broad@@ casting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ liter@@ ing programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a time window where no one wanted to see them ever .
&quot; for broad@@ casting , Johnson said the Committee : &quot; &quot; I call you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can obtain the best value below . &quot;
&quot; of course , think all , think that one gets for 150 £ a year here a great value , but for people who &apos;s for the 150 £ a lot of money , I ask if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 head of David El@@ stein , who also quoted before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their zi@@ ian mission and to inform them , to form and entertain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,@@ 1 % in radio - and it should be an example of public @-@ legal channels in Australia and Canada , for example . &quot;
&quot; regarding the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television is shown , and with the commercial sin@@ es alliances to make all available online . &quot;
&quot; son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics &quot; can control brain @-@ cells by ph@@ all@@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des will change the direction at the moment , in which they will be radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ sions . &quot;
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified ne@@ ural systems that can be controlled by dis@@ armament of sound@@ waves .
&quot; tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which they impul@@ sely affect human hearing , which have to be heard for human hearing . &quot;
impulses work by switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels to respond to ultras@@ ound channels .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms demonstrated the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ Get , where ultras@@ ound can be used to enable a range of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths @-@ brain stimulation , the electrical stim@@ uli into the bra@@ ins of people for treating the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; cas@@ c@@ ers usually do not respond to ultras@@ ound but Chal@@ as@@ ani reported that they did it , if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found it out , strengthen the ultras@@ ound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the increased ultras@@ ound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ters cells .
&quot; the wave @-@ waves effect the opening of these units , and activate the cells to which they are assigned to , thus a report of Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , gene@@ tically modified Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ or TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels have to bear . &quot;
&quot; when he applied ultras@@ ound in the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transfer into the wor@@ ms where they switch the altered Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the process has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ grams , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to neur@@ ons with impulses of light and turn off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ ji could have some advantages compared to this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , that has to be sent to an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultras@@ ound image can happen freely and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the afflic@@ ted human neur@@ ons temporarily pr@@ one to the ultras@@ ound diagnosis in a clinical c@@ ess@@ ation for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rule for life in Student Residence
&quot; eleven years ago I lived as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormitory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who &apos;ve been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long@@ itu@@ ous complaints about others . &quot;
most what I learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the move of student population extends from slightly nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely start@@ ling .
&quot; it is entic@@ ing to talk to : people tell wh@@ ence you come when you come in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re talking honestly Mar@@ m@@ ite no love nor hate , because Ernst , guys , there is only a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - do your questions and show interest .
&quot; this conversation and helps you to find out the people you like , as opposed to those with which you would not speak , even when your lashes in fire extingu@@ ished and that extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people are often transformed into beverages @-@ recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people take care of and make their under@@ wear . &quot;
click here : do not remember to start university with a relationship
spar@@ ed is receiving a rough handling at the university .
&quot; her room should be a refuge , but many students have a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ sight@@ se@@ Heights @-@ culture , which can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this may be the hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want our friendship going on , but you have to go away so that I have consumed the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a composite of milit@@ ant is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS rather than kno@@ ck .
apro@@ pos : do it .
&quot; a guy in my students , had the idea that a non @-@ co@@ d door was an invitation . &quot;
he saw some things .
friendship may close by b@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ Man@@ ie , the clo@@ p is present at the doors of people to imagine less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ spe@@ c year &quot; &quot; in the neighborhood , I got you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to entertain yourself and will end up perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed lot of fl@@ our , sugar and fat make that people face sleeping , if you anchor drops . &quot;
ste@@ al food is a common crime in student residents .
&quot; of course , the clut@@ ches of chicken is a rob@@ ber@@ y , but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the owner owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say , themselves to use , even when they cook in the inner . &quot;
&quot; if anybody was missing , is the annoying , and you have my compassion , but try to cont@@ end with them as my room@@ mate , that added to their milk a flush , to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; they should not make noise , which stops people from sleep or from work . &quot;
&quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but in the tru@@ est sense of pro@@ verb to the people who are sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , whether they lay them something , drum and bass , for it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted with even more lu@@ pl@@ eted music .
&quot; after all they had heard at 5 p.m. , they left their neighbours and they were able to sleep two hours before they shut their own music , shut their door shut down , and came to pass to the three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen by chance in the same dor@@ m residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not make a coincidence that if you have a room@@ mate for your future co @-@ partnership , adapt to them again and then you have to see it every day , and maybe together as they bring together all together friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but when a name is the room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk a little sense of reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has its key in its not locked room , the border between a ul@@ k and har@@ ass@@ ment is less than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is fun , but it takes only moments until he took to a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give away a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but don &apos;t miss someone &apos;s room using to@@ oth@@ paste and Sham@@ po@@ o .
&quot; shut down your door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but T@@ ack@@ ways you don &apos;t have your possessions on the blan@@ ket not more than twice . &quot;

thousands of refugees will push for a housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowing how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. G@@ ild@@ a , many refugees will push for a housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or gym has no sustainability .
for men stay to a great deal here .
in the face of the stream of refugees we need sufficient space in the coming decades .
a quite ban@@ quet , three @-@ case stim@@ uli is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a r@@ hi@@ b takes the least place .
it facilitates integration .
this is different in case one does the people in the blocks of the block .
&quot; each of the six houses that are currently built in the pilot project , consists of three dwell@@ ings for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees are saying , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily modified according to the respective needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ a : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is over@@ looked .
six months the building took place .
this is appropriate .
do the building rules have their plans complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : how legally I have carried out my project correctly .
particularly complicated makes it always the dro@@ h@@ end D@@ amo@@ kl@@ ah@@ er@@ ves@@ worth special construction and the space @-@ space Reg@@ ulations .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it will still under@@ mine who creates three apartments in a char@@ me house , needs at least three locations . &quot;
only in the cities is missing for that place .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did people react to their Rei@@ ress department project ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ a : there were those , who have accused me of creating these lux@@ uries for asylum seekers . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by entering &quot; &quot; Android App &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , you can download the phone the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are pushed after the installation to problems , as they get an error message that fail the &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to deal with the problem , users will be advised to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update across iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean deletion of apps to create room - but Apple has done this through the ability of updates not likely . likewise , it will be simpler to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during the update , or is located near a lo@@ ader , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; when the load is too low , Apple does not admit that the update will continue , as the phone may be dated using half paths , and this may lead to a demo@@ lition of the update . &quot;
continue : iOS 9 release still in the schedule despite the Wat@@ ch@@ OS delay in the review of iOS 9 : this is least exciting but the best update for iOS 9 : how to prepare for the new iPhone OS system
&quot; you should also make sure that you have seen our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things to prevent things going wrong and to protect yourself if they do it nevertheless . iOS 9 adds new features , including a much smaller personal assistant and enormous new productive features for the iPad , just as changes that speed up and the operating system repair . &quot;

a new Qu@@ arti@@ n office has recently opened .
&quot; here , directly next to the shopping market , you can immediately receive seniors and advice patient information on questions like for care insurance or for services provided by health care and nursing homes . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been firmly established with our out@@ patient care service that often care providers are left alone . &quot;
thereby there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; even if the complexity of the insurance companies are not currently being used , the complexity of the insurance policies will hardly be understood , &quot; explained the new landlord J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ in@@ ople and the Ombud@@ al as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , the new consultant office offers also the prevention , health care and wellness . &quot;
the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat by boat .
&quot; therefore , you can use additional promotions such as pet@@ rels , memory training or a physi@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;

&quot; witnesses looks for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mu@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking distance from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mu@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; a 17 years old new new Afgh@@ an , followed by the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them that they might be waiting for him . &quot;
at this time the group was on the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
on the site of the pet@@ rol station there were also three persons .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young people and struck his face with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ sh@@ ak@@ age and ble@@ eding strong from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends lived and per@@ ated to the bat , this first came down from his sacrifice . &quot;
he was brought home from his friends to the very last young man .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their ap@@ t. up to their apartment and was frequented several times .
&quot; when you no longer saw the vehicle , the wounded left for the building , to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person .

Dr. Frank Müller takes the practice Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros
&quot; Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , and Frank Müller ( from left ) take on the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel rocks . &quot;
&quot; also , Sam@@ t@@ collaborative team Dr. Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ists in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ m Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places of the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field . &quot;
&quot; when Ur@@ sel rocks go into retirement , her husband will stand Karl @-@ Heinrich His successor over the next few months still with half a place . &quot;
&quot; after the construction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy for the first glance , when Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently completed their specialized medical education in the dener Hospital and also wants to get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the garbage I would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel rocks . &quot;
&quot; when it was come , I simply called her . &quot;
&quot; couple Müller got the idea , in future in A@@ sen@@ dorf , to operate our own practice . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families through the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will see his own boss soon as well .
&quot; and so one was agreed , the garbage cans bought the house with the practice . &quot;
staying in Bru@@ ck@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; this two @-@ time family @-@ father Frank Müller was also raised in his medical studies at Hanover , Germany followed several visits in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ li@@ um , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
he is active as a senior doctor in Sul@@ ingen . he has also been appointed a leading doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is engaged in the DR@@ K readiness of Bru@@ in@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; starting on 19 September , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen has been working as a primary physician , his spouse has specialized into the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the bin , both of them , want to be present as a household . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after renovation the rooms are modern look .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and pay@@ load @-@ EK@@ GS and need a talk @-@ room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 euro will receive the mill@@ ers as part of a conveyor programme from the county town ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) , as well as the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are continuing to continue the practice continued , &quot; emphasises Sam@@ t@@ charitable team Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients come from St. Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter into the practice Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , in the North @-@ German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is still another home @-@ care office .
a positive out@@ effect of the practice of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to the Ur@@ sel rim in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor had found , it would also have gone . &quot;
&quot; who attended garbage cases , by the way can still continue to look in the familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock . &quot;
their part@@ ing ends at A@@ sen@@ dorf an era after all the medical people lived there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls the Ur@@ sel rocks . &quot;
a little m@@ eh@@ ood wast@@ es them after the long time already .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients certainly still , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; your husband will be compl@@ ac@@ ent : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter site . &quot;
&quot; hitherto have I always pressed ahead of gardening , now this could be different . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the pair has two grand@@ son and travels . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls will also be applied to our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; still , it was clear that everyone that has a asylum application , that can &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people are in the foreground .
&quot; but it is also clear that there needs significant signals , &quot; &quot; said the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know , that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , neither of the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia er@@ e@@ zes &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia was denied
Croatian government had previously communicated that Slovenia &apos;s plans to travel further towards Austria and Germany and under circumstances can also create cor@@ ridors for refugees .
&quot; however , this was not what happened in Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ tsch@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach had not yet . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; but also the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary will intensify . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia is considerably controlled as the border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the prime minister said , Slovenia is due to giving its limits to refugees . &quot;
&quot; any EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system may not work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government started , the first refugees would already have tried to travel in the night @-@ hours on Tuesday , in East Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , in order to escape the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police was able to take them in the near @-@ se@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , there has since been meeting new operations with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mostly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children . &quot;
also ambul@@ ance services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; over the coming days , his country with around 4,000 refugees said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo in the Maced@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which had so far transferred to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade disp@@ osed , however , that it is it that people try to make certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do so &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , at least in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Ser@@ b border city of Si@@ d , on the course of the day several buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were traveling all night away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border all night away from Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police told us that we should go here &quot; , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could actually actually be the forec@@ ast@@ ed shift of the past Balkan route to Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s interior ministers O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country for the fall of a strong , est@@ rogen made by refugees have prepared corresponding plans for possible down@@ time . &quot;
&quot; details he was not calling , but pointed out that Croatia is as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive options to limit control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
one perform strict controls to qualify for the membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , with the EU Partner in the country a good record of what affects the standards of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on Serbian side , behind the Hungarian border @-@ grain , some 300 refugees continue to be firm . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ goes , who goes to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ goes and Ja@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm them at a local bar@@ ge in Hor@@ gos or at the same time : he stop the debates on aging of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a question of very high refugee camps .
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers mar@@ ry migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian ge@@ aring shel@@ ters have already begun to re@@ distribute land cards on which alternative routes are embedded in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , still in more clean min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Mit@@ ter@@ o@@ chn@@ ach@@ ia , the Croatian police were known that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;

&quot; in this way , investig@@ ators increased over 100 million dollars . &quot;

&quot; it is about life , therefore we are with the action in the middle of the city and under people , &quot; says Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ ers represents both questions and discussions as well as volunteers .
&quot; during man@@ ch a pass goes spontane@@ ously to the K@@ rei@@ de attacks and set the sentence to &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; to &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not suffer too long , &quot; read , say propositions as &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the edge of small discussions about the action , in terms of life , life , handling with the dying . &quot;

so this public relation to the age of 20 is good .
&quot; wants that not everyone wants to openly tell on the tablets , however , it is understandable , ultimately it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ital@@ ist movement in recent years have contributed much to the fact that people open themselves . &quot;

&quot; as the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ital@@ ist , during the call of volunteers , she was immediately reported and had been in attendance during the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ c@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who are affected by the affected and depend@@ ents in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and in the hosp@@ ice of Saint Vincent . &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the final quarter , and the Consu@@ mptions of shares gave his profit to a whole year due to the weak@@ est demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ ton service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to charge about 5@@ 5,000 hours of pay@@ ers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at that time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set out 50,000 pay@@ ers for vacation time . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market @-@ commerce 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of over $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ per year due to the previous Previous post , 20 cent less than with earlier forecasts . &quot;
an@@ alysts expected according to a survey about Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; despite the price increase in spite of the price increase , average of 4,@@ 9 per cent is effective and will be effective on January 4 and despite higher revenue for bo@@ d@@ ots of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it is nonetheless , that the result was increased from the previous year due to cost coverage , higher revenue and because of growth in online commerce . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; solid yields , if people consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holidays employment were announced a day later than those of the Rival U@@ PS , which plans to set 9@@ 0.000 up to 9@@ 5,000 additional labor force , for example the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million entered , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share amoun@@ ted to € 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.7 per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks of Investment Research were told an@@ alysts . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of them questioned analy@@ st expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has gained a decline in international pri@@ or@@ ic shipping in recent years that brought sales in their unity with Express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales in bo@@ d@@ ots increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; express @-@ unit declined higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result dropped because of higher labour costs in cargo . &quot;
&quot; in Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ stocks increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2,5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent at a record high on June 11th . &quot;
&quot; on their most expected meeting in the year Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ es spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ minute Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni meeting , to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to start the conductor . &quot;
&quot; dor@@ m@@ ant about them at an end of the reduced , two @-@ story conference halls is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ella and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all the other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mission of Congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ trained public mandate : financial stability .
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predic@@ t them . it is announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the un@@ parall@@ eled attraction through the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; though most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets can make the more cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen this vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government - and be it just one fourth percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist in the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think , if they were looking for an excuse to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market has enough justification , continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing what the financial market sec@@ ures itself .
&quot; about half of econom@@ ists , which were recently reported by Bloomberg c@@ mentary , have predicted this week . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets expect a down@@ ward off the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that indicates a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the bo@@ unce hit the strike by promising that another increase is far removed . &quot;
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score around 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or around 1.4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy considers the sentence of this week , John Lon@@ ski , boss , Dr. M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets , so they do not get panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts ar@@ gues that a ten@@ dering raise the financial markets would calm , because it will take the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set of 0.@@ 25 percent@@ ages per month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of the mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ella had said in Spring and Spring summer , that in this year despite the complaints from liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement of the labour market in this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate sank from 5.@@ 1 % in the past month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
wage rates have shown signs of an recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was continuously passed under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , boss econom@@ ist with The Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world looked after the end of the last month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score more than 16 % among its maximum , as investors feared that a slow@@ ing of the Chinese economy would cru@@ de the global growth of th@@ rot@@ tles . &quot;
this month the market has recovered something while D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the high level of May .
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market uph@@ e@@ av@@ al are affecting the complex calculation , when one should increase the interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events were not occurred on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
he is saying that she will be waiting for at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Affairs has become the world .
the impact of the central bank was enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere indication of the former Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; close their mon@@ et@@ era expansion &quot; &quot; could be con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous across the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly linked , cannot only monitor developments in another place , but also consult with other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements , which apparently does not appear to be associated with the economic foundations . &quot;
&quot; however , a particip@@ atory member of the Federal Open Market Committee is committed to inser@@ tion ca@@ vities in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its conduc@@ t@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; despite limiting effects on growth in the U.S. , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the current re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee for the interest rates of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest tur@@ mo@@ il are not coming near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not go into the situation where they fear a fence , because the markets turn out , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act has still double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think they should hur@@ ry the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
guests are welcome to greet you with a warm welcome and a honorary assistant .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
some of them belong to Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is a teacher and a soul .
even with their 74 beds they are still instruc@@ ted to teach .
every Thursday she does it in the Asyl@@ um St@@ heim on the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
&quot; there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different lessons as at the right school . &quot;
Brazilian Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian clo@@ pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is trying to clear on the sho@@ cking way women as important good diet during the breast@@ feeding period . it does this with the presentation of babies that are painted at ro@@ ast farms that are painted with ren@@ der@@ ings of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies give all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; because of additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers will come to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake in order to increase calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation needed . &quot;
&quot; a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet also pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and they protect against the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system negative . &quot;
exceptions for the new am@@ ber of the sports hall
the community Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plan@@ ations for the long @-@ fle@@ dged turn@@ e@@ ering of the sports premises are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting the un@@ used construction tests was supplied without big discussions .
&quot; previously , the Panel had decided on the other hand a request for a structural &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; of valid &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form in terms of construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; sem@@ it@@ roof with a non @-@ accompanied first and bad@@ ger &quot; will be built . &quot;
&quot; background for planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar power plants : &quot; &quot; this is how we get together a wonderfully large aton@@ dd@@ ah , &quot; explained by Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; we went in turn around the an@@ tics that may lie for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is reduced considerably .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the dis@@ incl@@ ination not &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - with the am@@ ber of the community generally starts more restric@@ tive and restric@@ tive it . &quot;
&quot; it is however not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we cannot make a preced@@ ent , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the gym at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at the cost of some EUR 2.3 million euros have been calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and recreational promotion .
in the next process of process the building contract for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now to be submitted to the Land@@ rat@@ Office for the examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed before - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) of new medical director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au is used .
the station and the majority of the staff pull from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this fores@@ een the surprising plans of the hospital in the district of Land@@ circles that confirmed the Land@@ mark of Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
&quot; however , a decision on the board is the Supervisory Board , and the conven@@ es of the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if plans have plans to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 co @-@ workers at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would be continuing . &quot;
the vast majority of sol@@ ves undergo with fishermen and the further existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; associates who cannot be offered by Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered at W@@ eil@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed about their plans .
&quot; triggered the change of cancellation by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic , and is now changing to a private office in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question about who is to take up the follow @-@ up , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , who is prepared to take over the leadership of October 1st and to move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this was in each case a &quot; upgrading &quot; and wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; says Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ers .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the internal station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; for the next two years , fishermen who agree to agree with his team , when the Supervisory Board sec@@ ede to that , both homes have lead , until then in the next year the former hospital of Kn@@ uth , which has more than 35 beds , has finally been closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the provincial district had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing refurb@@ ishment of the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim was completed . &quot;
&quot; Land@@ sti@@ tin Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , joined the rum@@ ors of the house that is owned by the federal government , in the future as an accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; I close it . as it goes along with the real estate it could not tell Jo@@ chner @-@ White , there were several reflections . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term maintenance of the Car@@ itas and a conference rel@@ ent@@ ry .
&quot; what circum@@ ser@@ es could not happen to us ; such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; as fishermen about the Qu@@ asi moving to the Le@@ ch , who had been received positively and very understanding . &quot;
&quot; a real prospect for the house where fishermen has been working as a boss , for more than 30 years now . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague to take care of the job of your medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened with closure in recent decades , has been closed , for example the surgery and the birth@@ assistance . &quot;

&quot; how exactly the accident occurred , was initially unclear . &quot;
the crime police are determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violence
a crime susp@@ ect has led the police to the body of the first Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the course of the twenty @-@ year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their corp@@ ses were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
one since Saturday mixed 16 @-@ year @-@ old of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is shown to be victim to a victim .
&quot; the corp@@ se of the young woman was found at the evening evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as a prosec@@ utor and police arrived on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a tat@@ too , one also applies in the evening mass of 20 @-@ year @-@ old that actually indicate the indication and investig@@ ators said to the place of discovery of the body . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had already been reported on Sunday morning after they arrived at home on the eve of a autumn show in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of the autumn .
&quot; in the search of the young lady , the investig@@ ator looked at the personal objects of his offering . &quot;
in the interviews in the friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the ma@@ i@@ est finally resulted in a crime against the 20 year @-@ old .
the vi@@ cal perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
&quot; the public took the authorities , according to the law inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , who did 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the corp@@ ses laid in the canal . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns before Hous@@ ing Gn@@ at
the location on the German apartment market is tense .
&quot; also , more and more refugees seek to obtain an affordable amount of bills . &quot;
the pressure on the market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution warri@@ ors on the German construction market have long since begun .
&quot; with the emerging refugees and working seekers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
it compete with a accommodating citizen to pay the most paid apartments .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , it would have to build 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; in this outcome comes a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; Socialist papers &quot; &quot; of social housing . &quot;
&quot; to compare , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , there are 14@@ 0.000 apartments . &quot;
refugees after the first three months of their stay are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many are searching for the housing market and went to rent in the long queu@@ es before the flats .
&quot; according to the Federal Chancell@@ ery , however , in the last year it stays less than half of all asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the property market is not only due to the growing demand of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the construction sector over the past few years .
&quot; Germany is heading for a housing , which is bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , in the ball@@ areas were already some 77@@ ,000 units sold by Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many working places therefore dwelt in meg@@ acity in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed on the market un@@ inten@@ tionally longer at the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , the number of square meters per head in the past few years has declined . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance of &quot; social housing &quot; is propos@@ ing a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should spur the social housing . &quot;
this could be disp@@ ens@@ ed to the under@@ s@@ way tax and exposed the ground@@ tax to sponsored apartments .
&quot; in addition , the alliance to be attractive and tax evasion . &quot;
the conveyor programme for the refugees and motor vehicle motor vehicle motor vehicle applications are now well accepted in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start was called on the Monday evening at 184 million euros , more than half of the Euro had already been called for some 300 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia to set corridor
&quot; Hungary is practically no longer a breakthrough , since more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit of Slovenia to north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to agree on the establishment of a corridor for refugees with neighbouring countries .
&quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian interior ministers and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria , and is already part of the Schengen zone . &quot;
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; after the de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to go from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports of the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , put an ordinary asylum procedure in Hungary practically of superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an I@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but people who do not want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police in the morning were picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country .
&quot; most of the members of media have reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived safely by bus and taxis in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk on the green border to Croatia . &quot;
on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees are not encounter off to the fence .
&quot; for this , the border cross@@ bars poses other dangers . there are even sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
min@@ e@@ planners are now to quickly create a safe passage .
after the closing of the border there is hardly any more refugees crossing the border .
on Tuesday the police numbered the police of 3@@ 66 .
in front of the sh@@ utter on Monday we had been around 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws to overcome and damage the bor@@ der@@ land act as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eged .
the re@@ distributed detention pen@@ alties for up to five years and the deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday in the newly elected &quot; &quot; Tran@@ se@@ e@@ ons &quot; &quot; of 94 Asy@@ a , almost all - 93 - by the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; under the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two older people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees dro@@ w@@ ned there .
&quot; practically , however , no one has a view to get par@@ ted in Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe &quot; country . &quot;
the distr@@ acted asylum seekers should be there to be de@@ ported .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke began to stir @-@ up workers with it .
&quot; they gathered the trash , which had left thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side . &quot;
fixed lat@@ ches were split and one of the recording @-@ bearings in the bor@@ der@@ ment was rebuilt .
the purpose of this re@@ building was to express himself no one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Austria can only reach a few refugees following the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary . &quot;
the country has also enhanced its border controls .
&quot; around the 20,000 migrants were still in government , but still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the transport from there to Germany has been hal@@ ted in the morning at the statement of German authorities .
regular small groups of refugees on foot met regularly in Austria .
Mayor walked &quot; Gest@@ ure &quot; on the border
&quot; we were busy following the bridge on Sunday with the meeting rooms , when suddenly ten people were standing with rice wine at the entrance of the celebration , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor of Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to travel by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; but Germany on Sunday but because of the refugee flow to Austria had no surprise for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; leaving the town@@ ship , who immediately offered his help and the Gest@@ apo along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before , we have only shor@@ tens the ex@@ propri@@ ated score only once , with j@@ aus@@ al and drink . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we will drive them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; it was a matter of course , &quot; thus Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire defense .
&quot; this was very happy with us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the fired rail passengers were on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE in a regional train direction Pass@@ au to move it after the short notice of pro@@ clamation that the railway traffic was stopped in Germany , but still trying to cross the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was completed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high on the course .
&quot; the brid@@ ging association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday , a two @-@ brid@@ ging run - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án can now be sent to us for more f@@ ati@@ ses , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing holy policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than assisting in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures , our Chancellor continued to be highly officially and publicly handed down the attitude of the Hungarian government in the district of nation@@ alism of National Socialism . &quot;
suffering of this policy are not just those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in the border areas with chaotic conditions .
&quot; the refugees too must find that the &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish land &quot; , &quot; which she is invited and welcomed , nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a major challenge , given the continuing refugee streams and the nearby winter , with us decent conditions for protection seek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and there will be an even bigger one - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; placing of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday , be without great hosts , he pointed and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke of a &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ worthy situation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; altogether , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ rying in the he@@ ur@@ ary year . &quot;
&quot; to fulfil the number , must be found in the next weeks or 3@@ 5,000 accommodations - 20,000 should be provided by the countries , 15@@ ,000 of the covenant . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the floor , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the financial intermedi@@ aries he has already held talks .
they would have assured him even for the coming refugees quot@@ as .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
morning there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born to be glorified in the course of how the church will help .
&quot; great expectations relates to the asylum coordin@@ ator also to the OR@@ F action &quot; Hel@@ ps , like us . &quot;
at the platform individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation .
&quot; additionally one hopes to hotels , which will be empty in the winter . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; very high &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in emergen@@ cies , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers must keep a certain amount of the hand@@ shake or size of the Lie@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period of time &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; apply . &quot;
&quot; as opposed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the accommodation , he reveals Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentl@@ eman , whom one does not without further face the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; finally , Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic as they did . &quot;
your employees want to increase them on three to four .
the own source localization was not yet successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz in the office .
but there is obviously problems with the permit .
Linz for better distribution
the opening of city halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees planning the city of Linz .
&quot; at the moment , this is not necessary because people can practically do this under these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , for the emergency , further sites are to be checked for their fitness . &quot;
cri@@ tique between the authorities and the division of refugees within the Federal Republic .
other areas must make a contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) the governor of Josef P@@ add@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday to present more action in the refugee question .
he has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however there are now the corresponding border controls .
special trains with refugees after Germany will be no longer there any more .
&quot; however , the prot@@ ections would however were brought to Germany with regular journeys to Germany . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ add@@ inger had once more increased solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria takes place controls again at its borders , is a logical consequence only from the procedure adopted by the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; the &quot; &quot; New Wor@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial command is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the exchange @-@ extended IT @-@ group S &amp; T moved , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is supposed to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the clever heads of our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in Start@@ up companies of the New Wor@@ ft and later also acquire what to act .
&quot; from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which lower @-@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.@@ 7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the plant , 3.@@ 3 million euros by the Tech@@ Center , which was one third of the city of Linz , the Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meters resi@@ des in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent share requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ a opened a second shop in the arcade

&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old bearer of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ al arcade , and finally she has gotten up in form of another business district . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which she was sold under different pockets , suitcase , shoes and spices of different manufacturers , now it &apos;s all about construction hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses from 75 Euro . &quot;
bigger bags and accessories costs up to 500 Euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; but I have a long time if I want to open a store , &quot; says broad . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that even the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of its own location , where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the im@@ itation in the large @-@ room of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has got wide from her mother to the cradle .
&quot; I feel good at the moment when something develops , and I can show new trends at reasonable prices . &quot;
&quot; why such a woman can be seen with a nice hand@@ bag in customs clearance , the professional lady can not be un@@ answered with the latest safety . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of each out@@ fit occurs .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the ar@@ ouses ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp ( s ) came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
&quot; this property also man@@ oeu@@ vre to be with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the U.S. president . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for Ex@@ clu@@ ger well .
&quot; whether it is manifested to xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalists or scientists in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the presidential Presidency of the election campaign led to the election campaign . &quot;
and cuts well off .
&quot; this is also registered in the pe@@ ep@@ hal@@ ic sound , where the grandparents of the real estate law came from . &quot;
the New York &apos;s body with a little refresh@@ ingly is a term of wine at the Vin@@ eg@@ dorf .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village is related to -@@ every corner with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the electoral box . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ u@@ um@@ er Simone Wen@@ del turned into a film about Tru@@ mp .
&quot; and what do the vill@@ agers think about its aim , to become the most powerful man of the world ? &quot;
&quot; I think that &apos;s somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed at her K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter region , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native sound surrounded by the village has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , one of which is among Tru@@ mp also the Ket@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ est@@ y comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also on word - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of his hearts .
&quot; though I hold respect for the performance of the family , but also bi@@ ased the opinion that Tru@@ mp is already a little Moor@@ ish , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the locality I &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - too high @-@ German : the licens@@ ors , says it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the en@@ coder . &quot;
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a pub for min@@ ers . &quot;
foundation of the real estate company were first piece of land in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy : your desire to return to the home town , failed by the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record chest mp , because he once had to ch@@ ew without permission , the director of the Institut für pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische History and folk @-@ document , Roland Paul , was proclaimed the film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is contrast to the provided statements of the descendants .
&quot; he had repeatedly paid out over Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border line , to cry out illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; just as the pol@@ em@@ akers , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a removed relative chest , the grand@@ pa was a born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
the winem@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing . &quot; he is always so up@@ setting .
does he believe that Tru@@ mp comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he was never organized around K@@ all@@ stadt .
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ram@@ m men@@ tion@@ ned something like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz ended with a visit something for the church organ what is generally well ank@@ le .
&quot; this can I not imagine of the Donald &quot; , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they say it better if he does not win the choice , for &quot; he has such a radical view , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ wa@@ ator Sarah Ear@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former mass star of M@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recently @-@ wit@@ ted father , who exp@@ elled to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached an impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million . &quot;
critics had asked if Thom@@ son won a hit @-@ show Solo without the rafting Star Rebecca Gib@@ son .
&quot; the outcome of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and hit slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new Quiz show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ K@@ ee@@ fe resulted in an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;

the last three matches : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
un@@ covered ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons rocks , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have possibly unknow@@ ingly manifested who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , in which Sam Wood is finally left in The Bachelor , was wrapped in largest secrecy . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not award if she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows at the day before coming from three two are check@@ ered , you possibly have acci@@ dentally attached a reference to who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips up to the finale on Thursday .
&quot; all three women have ple@@ dged themselves to a ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and thereby know his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be their partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get Woods last rose ? &quot; , &quot; their answers to the game will be destroyed , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki knew both fast , except for itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood . &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and Sam@@ s energies noticed that she felt quite compatible , and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ wel@@ d Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week you made clear that Wood &quot; would be &quot; &quot; one &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is not just a game - I am un@@ condi@@ tionally set to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , whom Wood should choose if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say this , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is completed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 clock , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest following his move to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent to his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise choice .
&quot; some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a h@@ unter , as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League @-@ league for his first p@@ unt solution on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ es the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return , as well as in the ongoing game after an infringement of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show its true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of creating his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged her . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula Konrad Hay@@ ne also published in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ es was also encouraged by special teams @-@ coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who knew him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ es p@@ atz@@ t in a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ge@@ ek@@ y had hoped for his N@@ FL . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field looking for the playing field and later told the Australian Broadcasting duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne gathered the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in at the time in 2007 when a pass was conducted in his own in @-@ Go@@ al section at a T@@ ry for Queensland .

but the record number of refugees now dominates the free sel@@ ector meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic asylum will be super@@ imposed &quot; &quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger demanded up the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria and how it existed during the Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; so it does not go further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers do not want to push the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts , which are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W chef critici@@ zed that several states cannot be consistent : &quot; &quot; we were large uniform standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria rests off , others do not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become action @-@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed off after police &apos;s rub@@ bers on prot@@ esters in Nepal by shooting
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal by the police of rub@@ bers into a crowd , demonstrated against the proposed new Constitution , said a be@@ amer at Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out at the Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ in@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , leading District Apostle said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , with some of you were stones and brands . &quot;
&quot; Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police have inserted tre@@ m@@ eng@@ a and shot into the air before it resor@@ ted to rubber . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were in@@ jured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the use of rubber coatings , of which is known to be put to kill , but that they are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last two weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ als southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces will be formed under the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ itz who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10 . &quot;

the plot with the Em@@ der Youth Centre Alte Post is to be be@@ maintained again .
the city currently prepares for the marketing of 4000 @-@ meter surface areas .
&quot; however , there is a mixture of trade , commerce and residential - concrete offers are not yet available . &quot;
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market its land approximately 4000 square meters large plot in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations are currently running .
&quot; the grounds are planned to use the grounds for a mix of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it is offered by the city . &quot;
&quot; which investor does not ask , is not yet clear . &quot;
no contracts were made closed accordingly .
&quot; the town Em@@ den had a portion of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , just a few months ago and will tear the down town to be dismant@@ led . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are available on the table
the planners for the cottage settlement in the little sea at Em@@ den are taking shape .
the investor first introduced public plans for the project .
several An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the selling of their leisure time

now the plans for a new holiday cottage near the little sea are near to the table .
&quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der @-@ Building &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time at the assembly Committee of the Em@@ der Council on Monday evening . &quot;
the item on the non @-@ public part of the agenda had its agenda .
&quot; under pressure from the project cri@@ tic and the F@@ DP group , the S &amp; D Group led to investors and the administration of secret society , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ates went on all questions an answer , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
&quot; but it is good to be able to deal with all the rum@@ ors , now . &quot;
&quot; for months , the project has been around ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; fierce reactions among sea @-@ land@@ owners , who came into the meeting , called for the pictures and new details of the hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and manager in the member of the Commissioner of An@@ lier , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ented : &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ z , which prot@@ ru@@ des all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also feared as many other project cri@@ tic that the traffic would grow by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; there must come up whole bus@@ inv@@ itations , so that this has to be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly to the well one h@@ ect@@ are of the former host place is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; because this was not yet missing , also the development plans are still variable . &quot;

&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL , O ) announced a bi@@ double donations campaign which aims to help thousands of refugees to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ arch@@ ed the European nations , as they flee from the war and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announc@@ ing the donations to his blog .
&quot; instead of having a manager to make announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; about our trip included many dark rail and bus trips , just as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe grew , many people like my family are des@@ perate after help . &quot;
&quot; donations are going to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance for refugees and migrants . doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global donations collected to a value of 5.5 million were posted to $ 5 million to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

for easy @-@ weigh@@ ti@@ ly diabe@@ tics can be weight loss surgery .
the advantages of weight loss for lightweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
&quot; it is still too early to say , whether slightly overweight people with diabetes following the weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a conduc@@ tion about the new study in J@@ AM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; weight loss @-@ surgery or Adi@@ obesity surgery , use different methods to scale the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
&quot; about the years , obesity take part in the treatment of type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes are proven to be efficient , but most of the studies were being obes@@ e with a body mass @-@ Mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or above . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , some degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
BM@@ I from 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered being obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and ul@@ c@@ ers - to medical treatments for type 2 @-@ diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who are subjected to this operation , dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I was with those who do not received non @-@ surgical treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; under the ones who under@@ goes to a surgical procedure , in case of 36 % the diabetes condition was completely and at 28 % in whole . &quot;
in the medical @-@ treated group there was only one percent compared to diabetes and in some cases by only approximately two percent .
&quot; in addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group &quot; , found the authors out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also saw the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflected the blood sugar over time . &quot;
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent and is writing the researchers .
after surgery the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined from about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved tick @-@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mortality in five years , so the senior researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team is dealt with average results in the two types of the surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight in comparison to the guest tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and experienced a complete end to diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study he@@ avier people in Sweden , that surgery goes to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was under@@ p@@ aced people to die in obesity , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - as opposed to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage to survival in the surgery @-@ patient , Black@@ stone said , it is soothing for people with a BM@@ I amongst 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; that is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this low BM@@ I group , without higher risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors are supposed to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we humans get to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes , which have linked their body with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love history plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that sought to be devoted to fiction : a young woman , too late and un@@ sigh@@ tly , and after years the warm of her youth hits again and this fell in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love of love , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ hi@@ cker readers , for he plays in Lang@@ w@@ eiler and the neighbouring villages . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot record all the refugees , he said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader also called on to end violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the refugee crisis to the beginning of his ten day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is devoted to ethics studies .
he called for the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put into account the interests of individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is indeed admir@@ able , but the situation is not fair . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he said that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like a true peace and real development , mainly through education , for this Muslim countries &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the kill@@ ings in their countries is decreased . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action according to the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the USA attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after 11 September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ fs were good , but he put violence and that has caused un@@ expected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold rise of intake of inf@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; using tox@@ ins centers in the US report about an almost 400 % increase in the number of children below twelve years , which swal@@ low alcoholic beverages , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , using tox@@ control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming more common in these products , and unfortunately one percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children disinf@@ ect@@ ants are inten@@ tionally drinking while some are doing to impress their friends or because of a nuts in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people disinf@@ ect@@ ants only for a cheap experience .
teenagers have said to be mixed with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a tougher drink .
younger children can be explored by attractive no@@ zzles of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones that are par@@ ked .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes and or@@ anges , which are very appealing to children . &quot;
disinfection disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children can already lead a few injection @-@ poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly focused alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison Centre in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , Fox Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so you would not let sip a whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children and if children come on it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sp@@ lash of after straw@@ berry fragran@@ t water disinfection in school , was taken into a p@@ inch of treatment . &quot;
&quot; their blood @-@ alcoholic concentrations was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered by law in the case of an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated it at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ u@@ ded their words and was unable to go than they arrived in an emergency .
&quot; doctors later over@@ saw them overnight in a separate children &apos;s clinic on signs of deer @-@ trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed through the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has advised parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store pot@@ ent@@ san@@ itation outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol det@@ oxi@@ fication out there were several disinf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , after the swal@@ lowing of the disinfection of pot@@ ent@@ sia , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; staff of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol has been contained , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ anol , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January planned three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , to det@@ oxi@@ fy their &quot; &quot; teacher &quot; &quot; using anti@@ bacterial products around the teaching space , &quot; thus , it means a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to pot@@ assi@@ um disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ker them out of their room .
&quot; the police considered the negotiated plan as &quot; &quot; ch@@ it@@ tz &quot; , &quot; and rejected measures to the Prosec@@ ution . &quot;

&quot; the former ranking players and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch fans were lost interest in Celtic , since there is no title @-@ ri@@ vals with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently holding an Ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic Games increasingly and why ? &quot;
&quot; it is , because the Rang@@ ers are not there . &quot;
people here are not just talking about the return of the leader@@ boards .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m Games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland that want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will twi@@ sting things around , vibr@@ ates D@@ eil@@ a . &quot;
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic must fight but the Norwegian boss wa@@ its to turn things off .
&quot; after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by a 10 @-@ man from Aberdeen who now points to the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; Celtic had no bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel that this is - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need , really support provided by Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
&quot; now , together , is so important . &quot;

&quot; the ex @-@ Chief from Br@@ ent@@ ford said , &quot; &quot; The January @-@ Transfer @-@ window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come in summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate themselves what you have seen with our own group of this season .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while remaining in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.5 percent was higher than that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 per cent as the figures of the office for National Statis@@ tics ( ons ) showed .
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate of Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.3 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent . &quot;
the Permanent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has placed the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
&quot; it is almost a year ago , that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom . &quot;

why I become a exec@@ ution of a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is being put to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard Com@@ sip is executed by the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four un@@ official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was already held in January on his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists will see directions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than places available , there is a mak@@ es@@ ere lot@@ tery instead of choosing who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five .
who is selected will be watching it emotion@@ ally .
I cannot do this .
&quot; I am going to sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ony and a two and a half hours . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a notebook and take a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
&quot; a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you will get access . &quot;
I describe myself when you are .
&quot; she adm@@ its that she would have better formulated it , but she is still thinking that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Com@@ sip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
he told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ e@@ aker of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts , which I have made . &quot;
I will not go here again in detail .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ sip is un@@ guilty .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of effect .
&quot; however , I believe that a strong probability exists that he is not guilty of murder . &quot;
&quot; I believe , that there is no enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot;
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
&quot; I cannot claim , really obj@@ ectively . &quot;
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters to turn to .
&quot; what you will get from me is , what it means to die a man an unnecessary death . &quot;

the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was established on Tuesday for a household da@@ p@@ ulation in pel@@ vic .
&quot; then they discovered the susp@@ ects , I tried to escape to them in the direction C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he was in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming , come , and get inspired , &quot; he said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited about his unique formal tactics , therefore he turned into a depend@@ able tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Master @-@ the soccer player Ben Cous@@ in offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in the year 2006 , Cous@@ in his car drove in the dit@@ ch to un@@ lock a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cous@@ in @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards was trying to tone him out and threat@@ ens the racing sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy maintains that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his stables and then initi@@ ates the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and integrity department of Racing Victoria and suggested that they launched a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a cre@@ ed treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself found in difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ fer@@ sing at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the pi@@ on@@ age re@@ pro@@ aches and did not want it , that it &quot; &quot; see how to highly hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had before , nothing to say about it , and I have been eating long afterwards , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything at one time comes out , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
you know that it is extended .
&quot; sometimes one respon@@ ds , and one has to live with the consequences , and I must live with that which I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go about the main thing , and I want my owners to think I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they begin thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers . &quot;
then I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had temp@@ ted the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ coon , that the integrity department had tried to pi@@ ate his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart finished in a room with a man - which I &apos;m asked - and offered him an employment in my stables , to provide information about what I do within my stables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
&quot; apparently , it seems that I am a che@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they have the attempt to grasp . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , acting president of R@@ V@@ L , and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ o , were aware of this time and are still alive today . &quot;
&quot; should this be my view , that it is personally ? &quot;
&quot; has the R@@ V@@ L beha@@ ved as sol@@ em@@ n behavior , and are maybe people outside coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they must take me my license and bre@@ aches me , and I have no doubt that what I say , they can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where I didn &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I got the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the frustration of the coach has built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation into Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could throw &quot; his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ ra@@ yed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , designated the cre@@ eds &quot; &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; &quot; after having had taken a pack of mud or sound on the horse &apos;s deb@@ ated form , which ble@@ ak against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has carried out mist@@ aken mud upon the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been so , that all day could have been so . &quot;
but it had it that way on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy might be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack of the race day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who put these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go far , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
men asked for driving cur@@ sed
in the weekend the police have arrested a man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent c@@ urs@@ ed cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was supplied with the helicopter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries after it was hit by a car on the Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway .
&quot; the police said , the car drove further , without stopping , to help the in@@ jured driver . &quot;
on Monday a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia belongs to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged due to ap@@ sed cur@@ sed and mal@@ le@@ aking assistance and because of other traffic faults .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y strikes against ri@@ vals for ri@@ vals to Ring@@ fight
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y has criticism of the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League Favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
&quot; Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson , told that the refer@@ ee won the Storm player &quot; Ring@@ .@@ e &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in Sydney on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely covered note to the Storm team , after his team scored the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; example &quot; &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two consists of Queensland not too good &quot; in the w@@ ran@@ gle . &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ mer of his crew and said that they are concentr@@ ating only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team makes him confident , as it was eager to worry about getting be@@ aten off the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that emerges again and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson over Ring@@ d@@ defend , when she took us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that nothing has changed in our defensive system or the techniques all over the year . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics , a real main focus , and that has performed for us the trend . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore likely not to get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it is com@@ ical as this always appears at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett idea from &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he finished his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their play was , &quot; &quot; says Bell@@ am@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team who can play and watch this exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; that is the ball game , which you want to play when you have this kind of players . &quot;
&quot; he did this statement in 2010 , but now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play as they play . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago she didn &apos;t think about us when it was around the Big Games .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters gained a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the Play of bronze was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and do not make any points of a cl@@ amping ? &quot;
for me it is the schedules .
&quot; when they mention , it means that we are still going to meet them in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team released this weekend as they won the right , either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks at the next Saturday evening in the final round at A@@ AMI Park . tickets start from the next Tuesday morning . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ deposit for drug candidates
&quot; a man who could possibly pose a life @-@ long punishment due to his trial , into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine who were mu@@ cked to Queensland , was released to a security of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the C@@ police took 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he arrived in the sports harbour in the marina in the course of the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially deadly penalty for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the total quantity and that in the café made of an inno@@ cu@@ ous cause . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter f@@ agan , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; he explained the Court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the criminal , he changed the police about his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had offered a security of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the famili@@ arly statements of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dges F@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice to hold him away , not to appear , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on security , under the conditions that he stops his Australian and Serbian passport , det@@ ained by the police on a daily basis and stick to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g &apos;s phone of girls to temp@@ ting pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a wheel @-@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
&quot; Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g , took the phone of the girl , when this slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping farm .
&quot; she saw it by , found the confusing message and al@@ armed immediately its mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care about it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; web research , &quot; the terms for search of in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g maintained it to the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le in the Internet &quot; &quot; and he then presented to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ aring them . &quot;
&quot; prosec@@ ut@@ tin E@@ ili@@ dh Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction that it is addic@@ tive to sc@@ aring people . &quot;
&quot; he gave to the fact that the search was conducted on the computer from him , but said it had to be done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ op@@ hil@@ es pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
he was asked for his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the images and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head , when he may drink , and he said , he wants to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ m@@ bling and on crying . &quot;
so she also saw the decent pictures on the phone and made the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computers and Play@@ station used to talk to girls who saw a lot younger than he .
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , ple@@ aded guilty to the conditions of indictment un@@ decent pictures of children on June 14 , this year , and not to have appeared before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ender @-@ attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ g@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; there is no &quot; &quot; sexual element &quot; &quot; in its failure . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael wi@@ pe away from judgment to October to obtain background reports about social work .
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g was granted security deposit in this case , but was held in pre @-@ trial detention due to hosting hear@@ ings . &quot;
he was still recorded before the date of judgment in the directory of the sexual offen@@ ders .
tu@@ g@@ user devi@@ ate from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up away at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ gs were made up of fear of discovery and detention the people multiply in smaller borders
&quot; on the Austrian side , there was a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal Valley . &quot;
they were walking on bridges and c@@ isions to the German side .
there they will be taken from the police officer and passed on to the registration .
&quot; at the Munich central station , according to Federal Police of Germany , and in comparison to the beginning of the weekend , a lot more refugees arrived again on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; only up to 8 p.m. , some 700 people were arrived in the state capital city , said a spokes@@ person in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , the town had reached the town on Tuesday 17@@ 59 . &quot;
Stuttgart : sti@@ ff of tro@@ pen@@ storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
meteor@@ ites warn against stub@@ bor@@ ns in the southwest of Mit@@ tw@@ o@@ chn@@ ach@@ ia .
&quot; because of a low pressure area above Western Europe rivers , warm marine air currently divided into the country , divided into German weather services ( D@@ W@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful suff@@ erer is the prec@@ urs@@ or of the tropical reef , &quot; Henry &quot; who had gone over the Atlantic in the last days of the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
fierce storms and str@@ or@@ m are expected especially in Baden .
according to D@@ W@@ D still on Thursday morning also in the Black Forest on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Bo@@ seek@@ er @-@ circle with Bö@@ n from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun can be looked again into the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers present their novel@@ ties at the IA@@ A .
2015 is especially worth mentioning the compact car that is currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are particularly appreciated : approximately 28@@ ,@@ 1 per cent of the new registrations exp@@ ires according to the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August this segment . &quot;
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( publication days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept autom@@ obil@@ es and new luxury cars , many new compact models are introduced this year above all . &quot;
Rüssel@@ sheim / Germany . one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German auto industry is Opel Astra which will be at the deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn with the dealers .
&quot; the Astra model is an extremely important model for us , &quot; says Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; thus the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra model should not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is entering the largest cont@@ enders for the VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 Euro . &quot;
the current Astra costs from € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra model with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hor@@ se@@ power .
&quot; furthermore , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 HP , to which for the first time also three @-@ cylinder engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important ri@@ vals , VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra model only as five @-@ fifth . &quot;
&quot; as a second version I will follow in the spring of Kom@@ bi , who is already at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be presented next to the Astra model at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault also sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the trade fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as one @-@ fifth in a conventional and unique sport GT release .
&quot; in trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance wants to find its position in the highly growing segment in its new model .
&quot; thereby , the compact infin@@ ity fits with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get an gas@@ oline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but it also includes a diesel car with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model with pet@@ rol engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ lit@@ re tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturers in 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the sale launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the comp@@ ac@@ t@@ kl@@ assembled DS 4 that is visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ S@@ leg@@ er placed above all hand at the front part : here the cooler grill has been drawn , and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and integrated with Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; at the IA@@ A in the compact class , a number of over@@ worked and new versions such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 3@@ 08 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are man @-@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has been used to an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison quarters of the prison quarters , who was lod@@ ged a monthly cell in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their dignity , in@@ mates are basically entitled to financial compensation when they are stored in small cells . &quot;
that has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in an on Wednesday .
the suff@@ erer can even hope to make money if they were locked for a few days in the cr@@ amped conditions ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; so that an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional order was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in the judicial resort Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 , in a single cell with approximately five square meters floor space ; the toilet was not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who was moved to his lawyer by now on free foot in a larger cell . &quot;
his ministers were cancelled due to the un@@ worthy arrest conditions against the State of Berlin .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court began the decision of the Chamber of Appe@@ al in Berlin and in the case of renewed testing there . &quot;
they see the man of man hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if legal reasons have been made relevant to compensation for legal reasons , only a few days for compensation shall be decisive for compensation , it meant . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a st@@ amping of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot;
the chamber court must now clear the amount of money det@@ on@@ ation .
the constitutional inverters have often reinforced the rights of prisoners in the past .
they said only in April a prisoner of compensation because he was standing in a cell .
human dignity is a choice from 2011 as well as the multiple @-@ orientation of a cell without a separate toilet .
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday also the Berlin Constitutional Court , the one prisoner in November 2009 , confirmed an un@@ decent accommodation in a parallel in November 2009 . &quot;
the then Kl@@ äger was run every day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell and in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pr@@ isons were come to the head@@ lines over the last few weeks too .
&quot; prisoners are therefore repeatedly included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ vity rise , even to bat , it should have come on because of the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; after information on the judicial process , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of pro@@ pping @-@ lack , 19 should be cancelled . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create it
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany with forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in this year , according to the opinion of vice @-@ chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany is able to take Germany to a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated this issue in view of an unusual challenge : &quot; I tell you again and again , we can do it , and we create it . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , what gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; they are used for different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the federal Ministry of Commerce ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments each year - and the next five years . &quot;
&quot; that is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 flats ) . &quot;
&quot; the lack of housing housing is dramatically due to affordable housing objects : 60@@ 000 until 80@@ ,000 social housing from rent daily , and in order to apply these especially favorable homes to refugees . &quot;
&quot; this is why Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , of currently more than 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing had to happen , and therefore the federal government would have to invest in height of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and federal construction also agree that there must be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction .
&quot; according to the estimates of the Institute for Employment Research ( Employment Research ) , 55 percent of the refugees were to be employed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany would be asked no more systematically after their qualifications in order to help them get started by Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is crucial if they work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation of the union society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migrant researchers Dietrich Thr@@ es@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ issu@@ r , Germany has given a political transition : from the employment of refugees to the recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a job offered for asylum seekers of up to five years , this November 2014 was reduced to three months , just as the residences required , the asylum seekers have limited to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in the society also because of the lack of qualified labour , the view is widely recognised that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot;
a big hur@@ dle to access the labour market are lack of German knowledge .
&quot; until now , there is still no adequate offer of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the setup of networks is therefore to the point of view of the Königs@@ alle@@ gi@@ hardt of the Royal Road for work integration .
&quot; the Berlin school administration established that only a few adults their children to dwell in the nur@@ series , estimated at ten to 15 percent , &quot; &quot; said Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ i , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration offers hand@@ cu@@ le in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increased enormously thanks to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - by increasing more technical colleges . &quot;
in the countries pupils are prepared without German knowledge in welcome classes .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , even by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; in them there is no shortage , &quot; &quot; says Be@@ ate St@@ ara from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk appreci@@ ates that roughly 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany are expected to study .
&quot; basically , no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or commem@@ oration of the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , Interior Minister Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) , but has abandoned its position . &quot;
a study of study refugees could be facilitated and easy access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or debt , no performances take place after the Asyl@@ um Act , if they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; basically , there is not a BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they are not under the circle of the citizens of the b@@ af@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to be lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to shortened this gap to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this mort@@ g@@ gap does not need to be closed , call St@@ eff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ ne &apos;s Permanent Secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should receive BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many people , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succes@@ sively promote the same rights into Islam , and the existing state churches will develop right to a new state of religion . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important for the formation of a Muslim ch@@ izer , who cares for new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
the rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and are willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him certain possibilities of control . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be passed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; who wanted to leave such conflicts in Germany immediately , have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; said he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law at Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in future .
&quot; in this way , the majority of the majority of society have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more pressing . &quot;
Germany - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discri@@ min@@ atory system and a general gender equality law since a half decade .
&quot; but it is very slow , how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie shown itself to be systematically ignored in the police and authorities . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and stakeholders &apos; interest have been calling for long and why international treaties such as the Anti @-@ racial Convention in Germany must become a reality , where the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their ways - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally , Germany is able to supply the anticipated refugees of medi@@ cally , writes doctor President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ kind Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; said the Tages@@ spiegel &quot;
&quot; however , additional money was needed to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , demand Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , to all the starter immediately at registration health cards . &quot;
provided services could later be applied with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long run it would be highly question@@ able , so many people with the restricted performance catalogue , which regard the asylum @-@ law law . &quot;
otherwise make the doctors first in order to create language barriers .
&quot; so far , the Berlin Health Sciences The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse than other patients worse than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practice must be taken over costs , she demands . &quot;
it would also be helped by many refugees but also for more general medical procedures in emergency services .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; amongst the refugee @-@ children about give it much more un@@ ob@@ se@@ ful disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other medical pictures , German doctors came from their training but clear , believes Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize . and what affects the gri@@ pping angel , whether for the refugees possibly even allevi@@ ate in sight . &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have been a highly developed education system ; many refugees would even be doctors .
&quot; to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and ur@@ rec@@ laim again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees in Germany are also psych@@ ologically sick according to the predic@@ tion of bund@@ ology symptoms ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) . most suffer from an post@@ injury loading disorder or under depression .
&quot; very vulnerable be refugee camp , declared Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study conducted by the Technical University in Munich is that every fifth Syrian refugee stream is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is of a post@@ injury @-@ stress @-@ disorder , suffers from others by means of so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with breathing difficulty , Sch@@ win@@ ches , heart @-@ ras@@ en and death @-@ kan@@ gar@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are sleep and concentrations of concentration , strong sc@@ aff@@ ability and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that symptoms are chron@@ ically , be early treatment necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of psych@@ ically sick people receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; while psych@@ ically sick of asylum seekers can form an application for psych@@ otherapy in the welfare facilities , however the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices mostly party workers or doctors working for psych@@ ic diseases would not be trained if a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this is often mis@@ lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dreams
&quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the Circus &quot; &quot; falls back on the traditions of Circus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to pull each age group in the spell of amazing ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus invites you to dive in the riding arena on clay bricks .
&quot; our passion is the circ@@ us . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine to live without my Circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie , live , Ti@@ erle@@ e and Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current man@@ e@@ of @-@ staged .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circ@@ us has been in the hands of the family . &quot;
the gift to delight is the family therefore in the blood .
&quot; for us it is important to get away people away from their everyday life and carry them with them for two hours in a completely different world , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year of June . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ res with cosm@@ opolitan city flair , &quot; thus , Director Reinhard Pre@@ provide his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometers long tour can now experience this lifestyle .
the programme of Circus convinced by talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international circ@@ us festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ low@@ n Family draws the audience with wi@@ t and charm in their spell . &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers understand their handic@@ ra@@ fts .
the heroes of Sil@@ ent@@ movies wants to start the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and mot@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
your hum@@ orous art on the mast is to conquer women &apos;s her@@ on in storm .
apart from numerous bo@@ oting the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus also produces with finger@@ sp@@ it@@ ary sense and joint .
balancing the wheel of a ball ?
for He Yuan no problem .
sn@@ ake is fascinated and frigh@@ tening at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephen &apos;s mother , Brig@@ itte . &quot;
dis@@ connections in the attitude of circ@@ uses are just too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie , also is taking a stand : &quot; &quot; we are not well in our animals , it is also not good at all . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
&quot; the four @-@ legged creatures , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read by the sight of any desire of the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
does not feel the animal at ease and doesn &apos;t want to take it into the arena .
the highest commandment is therefore : good for the animals care .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land@@ pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ stu@@ te , the family is proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing is happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; tells Brig@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the flaw , but this is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus itself . &quot;
so for each visitor it is likely to be something .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie , &quot; No matter whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with full heart . &quot;
Circus charges took place from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the idea at 5 p.m. , prices are discounted . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the wel@@ der daily from 10 am to 6 pm on daily basis . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ ys@@ itting Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a false speech in the parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , the el@@ dest leader of Africa &apos;s el@@ dest leader , was going down from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall rapidly spread over social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also frau@@ ght with alleg@@ ations of MEPs from the opposition , that anonymous death threats , and they were warned of joining the address by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; last month she had rest him , and interrupted him in his speech at the position of the nation in parliament - this is the talk he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their mobil@@ es they warned Mr. Mu@@ ff &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she told the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ ff &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the EP Members Parliament , that the immunity in the Parliament will end , and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective . &quot;
&quot; he said the boss , the &quot; &quot; Morgan T@@ sv@@ angi@@ ra@@ i run &quot; &quot; was concerned about the dangers for the politicians . &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up 25,000 to 30.000 jobs as part of the restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP is later to split companies this year into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job improvement leads to a load of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter . HP said in a statement .
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more highly competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive , who shall lead the unity after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a wide and thorough portfolio of shops that support firms when transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 annual revenue and &quot; has been focusing on Un@@ market@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it was a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave P@@ ard , which is called electric facilities and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is &quot; &quot; the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley &quot; . &quot; &quot;
HP has made a massive transformation process to cope with the removal of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech company , is the newest in this area , based on the belief that collabor@@ ated companies provide better performance . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ senal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta , says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the over @-@ last Jack Wil@@ hel@@ ere &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed that it was just September , and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he could not play before Christmas again . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario is already that Wil@@ hel@@ ers are sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its involvement in the next summer is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the great shame at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had stopped the last season following a separate kno@@ ck@@ y breaking , and then returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healed .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
there was no contact with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries that he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical view , but as sal@@ ger also recognized , there is the per@@ severe danger of further injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it is also developing an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd presents 23 different diseases from Wil@@ low since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 lig@@ as@@ ons in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that they were in six of eight hours times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League &apos;s clubs , who have reported most vulner@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from injury , you have a sus@@ cep@@ tible period , a time in which you have to gain your body and win mar@@ tial force . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will undergo a career by the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ senal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night vs. Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself a rotation within the team . &quot;
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia and mean that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with C@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of rep@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to give a small bal@@ lot , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although ar@@ senal clear favour@@ ites are , by Group F further , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ be@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; Un@@ defeated &quot; campaign was started in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the Stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , being measured on the judge scale 3.@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that ar@@ senal has drawn the teaching out of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and continues to be driven away from the far @-@ away hope , with his management the association to guide its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; that drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked with ar@@ senal .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves now even more des@@ perate than ever before has proved to be su@@ icide under young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important hur@@ dle in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it stays more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , announced the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ase ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ edi@@ ty life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the goal of asking the men to seek help if they need it . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a current study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms put certain that when the suff@@ erer had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not depres@@ sive , hal@@ ved a circle of spiritual and healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends in order so that a friendship may work .
&quot; in the age of social media , communication with a focus on style about substance is often more important than an in@@ significant contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need , strong , survival and successfully to appear , even when in reality the insulation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists st extra trin@@ sic values , ; money , image , social status , everything at costs in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game , and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that focuss@@ ing on the head was put .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , that gli@@ des through the interaction as friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent hu@@ gs , moments in the football fan and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they are often with@@ holding their feelings completely . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the call care process I explained : ... &quot; &quot; my feeder play for people who feel depres@@ sed and su@@ icide , I really clearly showed how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men that contact us are often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems . &quot;
&quot; Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind , if I try to offer long @-@ term safety assemblies . &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so very my objective out@@ si@@ ders status over the phone may help the people in eye @-@ sight of despair , too , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed backdrop , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks somebody alone sitting around , give it a smile and say hello . &quot;
one never knows what difference your friendship might make .
friends is sent on Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all of the 2@@ 36 episodes - for the # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; meeting Maria to help PS@@ G to help , Malmö . &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates on Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani by his visit to Malmö .
&quot; di Maria , at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to attract PS@@ G to Malmö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course in Paris Saint @-@ Germain in his Champions League season , with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prince &apos;s Is@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League de@@ bug as PS@@ G players who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead , as Cav@@ ani scored in the 6@@ 1st minute a head . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A , Paris takes a strong start for the Swedish master , as it did not only strive for the qualification rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ whales in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no pl@@ ain@@ game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with young in I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s missed chances of the gate . he later began in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with which he began his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . hence , it &apos;s a good start to gain 2 : 0 to provo@@ ke our opponents problems and look back better , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; said Mont Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to gain and we won , even though I do not regret that we had not scored one or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to Paris in one of three shifts in Paris , which could hold on the weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on their own place at Bordeaux in the First League , but he was replaced by Di Maria at the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing was called the man who can take the PS@@ G towards the next stage in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he ran in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malmö defense , before going to Joh@@ an Wil@@ derness passed nicely into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G was a great victory , it was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , made the Celtic in a Play @-@ off to reach this level , came near with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the cent@@ er@@ field rou@@ gh@@ ed a serious opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , which went far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , it offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself gave themselves sometimes to , with some mis@@ ch@@ illing and bad finishes , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was abandoned with no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the start . &quot;
&quot; however , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria transformed into a kno@@ cks which was over by wild and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ sten . &quot;
&quot; the second gate was finally struck shortly after the hours @-@ brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay who had its sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had left a left side of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malmö can return to the game and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ ders from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could keep low before sub@@ gam@@ er Ez@@ ek@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been thrown at the end of the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ p , gave later to that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league that has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification games do not reach out . &quot;
hut from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on made the af@@ ru@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said , she will not take him behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a episode of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when this stressed the need for alternative perspectives , stres@@ sing in regards to a black prot@@ ag@@ onists in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the movie and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted , sho@@ cked with bel@@ ated un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! Wo@@ w . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ o@@ cle@@ ans themselves . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown opened the production of Ben Aff@@ ir@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to call on people to think about it - who will continue to be the director - as she treat the figure of Harmony , she said at first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , which is be@@ aten by her white list@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the reg@@ ie rights to the film . Dam@@ on ref@@ uted that their Reg@@ ie &quot; &quot; could give us something , what we do not want . &quot;
once the discussion has been broadcast and the social media used to dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; Twitter @-@ users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his rage on the clip expressing it by &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s so gr@@ asp@@ ed that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4.000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on comments arrive at a time when the exact rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter declared national action and suppl@@ anted leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities , discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colored charges . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince began a campaign on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album still small , ( albums still have their meaning ) . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , also albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation and in response to the issue of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth ha@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; it was recently announced that Dam@@ on found himself on a list of entertainment , producers and media interest , invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ning first champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ bers and operator assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athl@@ ete which won the American Ninja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million with home .
&quot; the contest , which just closed its 7th season , had never experienced a contest participant , who finished all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , up to the final . &quot;
the climb to the last task belonged to the rock climbing at a 75 foot long wire rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; B@@ ritten completed the task within the time , with which he was the first athl@@ ete which completed the gru@@ eling phase 4 by American Ninja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended up these challenging three seconds faster , what made it the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or the life , &quot; said Isaac E ! through his bunch of money . &quot;
suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood re@@ por@@ ters to discuss the Final and why B@@ ritten , although he was first granted the course at all , not any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
don &apos;t think he will have a groove like it .
he has just been so happy to have done what he has done .
masses of awards received him from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; she said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by somebody , then I am glad there is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Isaac should have felt just the same , if they were sw@@ apping the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Ninja Warri@@ or was renewed for a rel@@ ay season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over in Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they had one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
the tigers are reduced to their roles as a spo@@ ilers that they played this part perfect in the Tuesday evening against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the tw@@ ins lead a chance to rise in a season of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game card .
&quot; for Detroit , albeit for an evening , it was a return to the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to hold over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter what it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Pa@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon focused his early offensive support , when Detroit had scored three times in the first two minds , then once in the sixth place and then once in the ninth . &quot;
&quot; Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times at the 1 / 3 Internal memory , and made three of us . &quot;
it was just his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strong , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in the bull@@ seye each game , and therefore I want to concentrate completely on the game . &quot;
the design@@ ate Tiger of Hit@@ tes Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three matches and was in two R@@ us his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
&quot; it was the first tri@@ er hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits to the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has received the pl@@ ywood well , &quot; said Ex@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( percussion training ) , saw clearly better from the bull@@ seye and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three of us in the rear of the seventh month , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game . &quot;
the Center fiel@@ ded by the By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning by a double in the left mouse line .
&quot; Right Port of Aaron H@@ icks reached a fenced , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy passed wall , the only man who was confronted with whom he was confronted with @-@ design@@ ate ro@@ ok@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano , who was a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the finish @-@ run during the second put Ver@@ hagen to the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
&quot; this was the major event in the major league for the second time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a Double Play was hit . &quot;
&quot; after Detroit arranged a Insurance Run at the end of the ne@@ bottom , creating an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and reached the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
however the right @-@ handed put forward S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth stay .
Detroit benef@@ itted to the start of the game from an even not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three rel@@ ay in the first two inside against the right @-@ wing veter@@ an who had been removed from the game from the vulner@@ ability , after spending more than a month because of a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wished , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt comfor@@ ting when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches for the third inning . &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter in the first of the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes made a single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z launched Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who created a single &quot; up the &quot; &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed to record his 0 @-@ 21 track record with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right , created another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game than he tried to get to the third that the threat was made . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers placed on the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Field of Anthony G@@ ose of the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ ter . &quot;
he did not work very well but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was located in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count does not cost any points in the third inning before it was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
in Hu@@ gh@@ es there came three of us at six hits and a walk with four cor@@ ke@@ e@@ outs .
notes : tiger R@@ HP Anim@@ als San@@ che@@ z ex@@ pi@@ red because of a violation of the wor@@ m@@ ors .
&quot; he is being examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since the middle of August on the viol@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ duty , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel is removed from the viol@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins . &quot;

he has been missing since August 20 because of a dis@@ ruption in the right hip joint .

hundreds of refugees shall be taught in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the one of the most sought @-@ by people will then be accommod@@ ated in the accommodation in Wiesbaden , just as the city of Wiesbaden lived on the evening . &quot;
it calculated with 450 to 750 in future refugees .
several gy@@ ms of the h@@ edi@@ an State Capital had been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily come down there .
they shall then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the last ten days alone , according to details of the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister of G@@ ießen , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse . &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up the great number of migrants &quot; accommodations in gy@@ ms because of the great number of refugees .
Isch@@ d : German military intervention in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich &apos;s security conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ d , holds military action with German participation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the f@@ arewell thinking about military action , may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he rejected the European states &apos; collective &apos; .
four years ago I was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of a military participation in Germany had been passing .
&quot; now the conflict cuts on our door@@ step , &quot; he said at Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for massive up@@ scale international aid to refugees .
Austria controls the southern and eastern borders
&quot; to Germany , Austria has also introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner told the Tuesday evening at the Austrian TV station OR@@ F , to Hungary also no one will be returned . &quot;
also Germany have returned no refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; ask a deal after an agreement , which Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , a relevant conversation between the Direc@@ torate for Public Safety and representatives from Germany . &quot;
concrete figures called them not and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days thousands of refugees have come across the so @-@ called Bal@@ es route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is usually Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit in cooperation with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common action in the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers will want to take a new resume on the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees at a special meeting , on September 22 . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries with the first @-@ set @-@ up and the distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will take this together with the countries , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after nearly four hours of deliber@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Regi@@ strar in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel sets under Merkel , those people , who want to protect them . &quot;
&quot; but who did not have a bird &apos;s eye , could not remain in Germany too . &quot;
this idea was dealt into by hand in the lap .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now take a &quot; huge force of force &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of des@@ perate refugees are now stuck at the Baltic Sea route . &quot;
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania will go back with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary plans to prevent the tu@@ gs of foreigners over Romania , Hungary said &apos; Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to to the planned new border . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan promptly .
there were first arres@@ ts of people who scored the fence .
in Turkey there were such a witness as thousands of migrants were declar@@ ing the road to the Greek border .

&quot; when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
the shell color alone says nothing about how mature the fruit is - so you can taste green man@@ goes really delicious .
&quot; they should be stored at room temperature , and consumed in a few days . &quot;

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther @-@ Platz
&quot; just 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the Saint Ign@@ a@@ zio San , an unprecedented place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German reform@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the old Rome right next to the Colos@@ seum .
the naming was requested by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled the Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the City of the Pop@@ es could only be lived in secret about centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; with the square will become visible in symbolic terms , that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was regarded as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the annual revolution 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city at that time as a rever@@ ber@@ ty ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions could be strengthened according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
Lu@@ ther had then introduced his th@@ eses against the cr@@ ashed in the spl@@ itting of the finished church .
hammer artist direct three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( cur@@ ated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main ones who painted Ot@@ mar Old for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and Bible texts updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which is now appearing with magnificent pictures now . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Old has formulated according to his own personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics can be customized , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; around three years Ot@@ mar Old worked on his Bible Project , for whom he met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of &quot; &quot; Book of all Books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are developed cycles , which devote themselves to topics like crosses , pl@@ ag@@ ues , commandments or pat@@ rons . &quot;
in this way he was spontane@@ ously fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther publishing company with its the@@ ological orientation as well as the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books .
and it is especially the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ mail who has focused on the basis of painting with the respective scriptures .
&quot; he interpreted the &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Old selected Bible &quot; , &quot; and is now translated into current relationships . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ert painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible study of Martin Lu@@ ther and a proposition of the artist who formulated this very personal thought in the particular situation here .
the jewel @-@ band has Golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old age allowed twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately born at all at all for the Bible Project ; Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant heritage . &quot;
&quot; and the education already occurred at the rod , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work out this , to be able to carry me back to the Lord again . &quot;
&quot; its second concern is to help the art in faster time again to more significance : &quot; the perception of image worlds is of advertising today , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have another desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old wants that the viewer will let down the pictures , let them work , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is dedicated to his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post stri@@ des on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert art to be : &quot; I like how he understood life with his own pictures .
&quot; I have not mind to grasp the Bible completely , but that is chosen for him very important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler , the Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deepen life and to find freedom . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler , both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility . &quot;
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas Prin@@ ted - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15th in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation .
building for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn near
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned , company commissioned for a circuit excursion : one year later almost everything was done - but just before the official opening of the BM@@ X train has been finished again . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions , both in politics and administration , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the course . &quot;
&quot; thus , hills de@@ ported , new place were looking for - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will enter in October , the first council of the Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now share in the children &apos;s children and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen yet , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it was then without a &quot; &quot; pause &quot; &quot; of work with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees to 2019 ; the Bundes@@ liga sets out a clear sign on the weekend .
the Football re@@ acts to the changes in Germany and ensures the policy of helping us to cope with the problem .
&quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can no man say in principle , it doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must interest each and every one of us to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B manager Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or and catch the coup in Ms. O@@ zo@@ j@@ u@@ z , and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; because the topic will certainly play a key role &quot; , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and wants to heal .
but the decisive s@@ laugh@@ ing must put the policy .
the German Football Association therefore adopted his refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome to four years .
&quot; regarding the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some Bundes@@ liga support this program .
&quot; already at this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ er set a clear sign when they are on the left @-@ wing extrem@@ ist instead of the usual sponsorship logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; &quot; We help - # failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; said Lever@@ kus@@ ens &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as a &quot; course . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama works every one , nobody must see . &quot;
&quot; we cannot use soccer world , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director , Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
the European Championship of EM against Hungary at this Friday invites the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach called for the support of refugees as a &quot; large communal work in German football . &quot;
that all 36 licenses would have started their own projects in their places would be great .
equally great is that small and smallest associations are there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome we spent , will be lived in football . &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this year and next year , the association will be providing 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees in conjunction with the DF@@ B selection and the German Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also called for 2015 too , &quot; told Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Cur@@ a@@ ef loses an eye
&quot; the head @-@ head of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost sight of several reports , due to the fall of July the left eye . &quot;
&quot; in the accident at the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA he had fallen after midnight on a water glass , which he put in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; Economic Week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost hem@@ med , it was power@@ less , then just tow@@ ed out on the road - that has he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; Wi@@ i &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder H@@ asso Princess . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could prove his job .
&quot; early October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said flat @-@ makers . &quot;
&quot; the 54 year old manager is involved in the meetings and &quot; &quot; fully functioning &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to drive the software group . &quot;
&quot; I am fully equipped for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and whose chairman H@@ ass@@ esses &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Jacques Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since summer it was no longer in the German headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; let him be important to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen such a thing . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up , once you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except ge@@ fi@@ ish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ter@@ ated an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the injury while being over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes in Singapore at the weekend in Singapore as little as a reserve driver for the two pedi@@ gree Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button to ask how a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : past@@ ure f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes to a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us in the first board@@ game of the Europe League will finally cr@@ ush .
the National Championship is also missing the leader of the football Bundes@@ liga as a Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar at Thursday ( 7.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on Him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Lever@@ k@@ usen again , let the BV@@ B @-@ coach is open : &quot; we expect to return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el will change his tribe at the position of the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ eper position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of Chief ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher of the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , Tu@@ den@@ f@@ eller comes to be used in all Europe league games , but made Tu@@ ch@@ el open . &quot;
with a high degree of probability he will also share the second game .
the for@@ bi@@ ous statement of fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the final call for the BV@@ B in the Europe League has to be the goal of construc@@ ting mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for veri@@ fi@@ able : &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong .
&quot; I think , that we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants the lead in Germany
Germany is supposed to be leading the state of the German government in the course of changing the cars .
the Federal Constitutional Court decided on Wednesday a strategy report from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) among other things investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; at the end of Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ br@@ ene went to Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the IA@@ A from a &quot; new mobility Age . &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and make for less st@@ oning , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which also come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A . &quot;
the Concept Paper of the Traffic range empha@@ sizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band support and a high level of digital sound .
the testing of new technology currently produces a test track on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order to prevent the driver &quot; no additional liability of liability &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to examine the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to employ around internationally for ensuring that the permitted maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 m kilometers is disc@@ oura@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government is also intended to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far sees man as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving takes over the car the guide , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which capture the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to one of the submitted study , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , un@@ solic@@ ited vehicles should be expected on public roads &quot; only far to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; added @-@ value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital inter@@ linking of the cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ traffic situation of Swe@@ ar Bart@@ ol . &quot;
but the question of liability in the case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the Germans are still scep@@ tical - but much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a survey on the AA series held on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute for the evaluation of the For@@ sa Institute for the evaluation of the Centers DE@@ K@@ RA is coming to the result , that only eight percent of the Germans believe that the autonomous cars will count in the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey conducted by digital and Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to complete control during the whole trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , this could be more than 15 percent in flowing traffic , at the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will wish to present only in individual positions on the title of 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision should be handed down on September 22 .
&quot; this is huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo from the title , &quot; said Con@@ duc@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ler during the EM @-@ Chair in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term co @-@ term sponsor@@ ing in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; stated single @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the press list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but rec@@ alled by the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo was also missing , and we are Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; this should be oriented to us , &quot; &quot; declared the world @-@ tran@@ ch@@ ist in fifth . &quot;
the English football @-@ national player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has had a serious injury on the right leg .
at the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven the def@@ ender was taken in the Tac@@ kl@@ ing from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno and changed after a long treatment .
the first diagnosis is pointed out at the 20 year old fellow @-@ players from Bas@@ tian S@@ no@@ vice on a ship .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a f@@ f@@ ant .
&quot; it is a mix of very big mo@@ vi@@ dal show and a qu@@ ake figures : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich . &quot;
&quot; highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which can be scary , thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer - among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and with it that he put men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of hau@@ te cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; before it was too easy , meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion jewellery has changed its beginning to a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been against it , for : &quot; for me a exhibition was a bit after death &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ whose . &quot;
&quot; there is a tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the very hard work of the man , who has written fashion history without ever having a traine@@ e . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not structured but it is an excellent choreo@@ graphic work @-@ work , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ ise the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material made the makers according to indications of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October legend was still a special sn@@ out there : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen Out@@ fit with basket .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are more beautiful than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ump @-@ old t@@ ed@@ dy is seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , cal@@ li@@ ly mod@@ est@@ o@@ dic instrument @-@ try of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , she said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a d@@ oll , his parents could not have allowed him . &quot;
he will have taken care of fashion later on .
&quot; he sto@@ ols fashion magazines and saw himself the dra@@ fts of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought this but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to reserve the gear .
jewelry instead of gest@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Point as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; used earlier , it went to the long nitrogen machines in and to make gau@@ ge about meters . &quot;
&quot; the fabrics and tips developed in large quantities for customers , which they have prepared for example on blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone is no longer working , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ ang@@ rier . &quot;
instead the fashion is important .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s head , fashion played a bigger role , then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional brands . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which rests itself to past events , an increasing share . &quot;
who is not operating in the textile branch in Germany is no longer served on the market .
&quot; with us , they already have half of all orders . &quot;
Light@@ speed Rec@@ ei@@ ving is together with nine further companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they must bear the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of its sales were dis@@ continued . &quot;
private specialty shops and also retail outlets are no longer available .
our products reach the customer on this path .
the bulk goods are generally produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is driven almost exclusively by chains .
&quot; it is also weak@@ ening of the export , currently to Russia and the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association also attempts to score on environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer was explained by the nitrogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; from this year we conduct a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially balanced . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma assistant U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger State University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to with@@ stand the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and plants , who need to think especially economically . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago un@@ loved textile design Kat@@ i Re@@ uter becomes the historic snow@@ l@@ ace .
attach the machine to several places small kitchen .
&quot; the pl@@ ain@@ ted gold bul@@ let in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach stra@@ ined was inspired by it : &quot; previously I could not start anything with traditional pl@@ ain@@ ted tip . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the g@@ tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process they character@@ izes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies the USA , Australia and Finland - especially customers who have lived in po@@ ets and surroundings , and who wish to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
therefore I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .

&quot; but according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; however , it is not about new ver@@ aming , but a kind of continuation that the 20 years after the first film plays with the magical children &apos;s wheel . &quot;
it is about the experience of the D@@ anny with the Robinson family in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI urges them to open the economy more broadly to the world
&quot; the economy has to be wider broader to the outside world to promote growth , President of Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should push for campa@@ ign@@ ing to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech during the sixteenth meeting of the central management group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; start @-@ ups and promote reforms , will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; Xi &apos;an . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity list to regulate the market access , relaxation of the border controls policy , promoting the border controls policy , support for government companies ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and modernization of the population &apos;s population system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list will be created , sectors and companies identified for investment not . &quot;
the system will be gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of significance , as it indicates the market a larger role in the allocation of resources , a legal operating environment ensured and the market was more open , the statement said . &quot;
&quot; the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the company , and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot;
statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border business co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; within the framework of an offer , controlled controlled sectors , additional areas for private investments are opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will safeguard the justi@@ fications of foreign financial interests and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; while the request has been optimized and the application process is facilitated . &quot;
&quot; ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ The right of lawyers to guarantee , exercised their activity , and professional judge and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;

EU wants to double the mer@@ cury @-@ limits in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and to give consumers a much higher dose of nerve end@@ ra@@ ster .
&quot; the F@@ ood@@ watch , which is pre @-@ supporting a pre @-@ supporting part of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects inf@@ alli@@ ble indu@@ str@@ y- and environmental policies passed on with full weight to pregnant and small children , &quot; &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt bor@@ ates the threshold values for large fish at the end of the food chain such as sh@@ arks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of Mer@@ cury per kilo@@ gram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large rob@@ ber@@ y @-@ fish are already so highly loaded with mer@@ cury that on the basis of the still valid threshold values about 50 per cent of the length are not sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ ven@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in return for this sl@@ ling , the EU lou@@ dly wants to shar@@ pen the threshold values on other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ gram of Mer@@ cury per kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch regards this but as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller peac@@ ek@@ fish , such as car@@ p are usually so low stra@@ ined , that they already respect the planned maximum @-@ values already today . &quot;
&quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ ically is therefore an per@@ fi@@ fi@@ di@@ version of distr@@ actions that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; says Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ cury is a human @-@ poison@@ ous for man , that is strongly frequented by the food chain in particular in pre@@ dat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the federal government is giving us a warning that &quot; &quot; small quantities are particularly related to the inf@@ uses of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable national values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
Mer@@ cury gets mainly due to carbon @-@ burning in the environment .
&quot; the German coal @-@ fired power plants come up according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Commerce to the Green federal Parliament , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock in excess of six tonnes of silver in the year , two thirds of the total amount consumed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish is approximately in the Elbe , the Rhine and the Danube is &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; in March from the paper . &quot;
in the past year Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings of mer@@ cury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
