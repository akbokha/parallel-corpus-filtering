anti @-@ R@@ h blood @-@ group sera every speci@@ fic@@ ity can belong to one of two types which distinguish themselves through the conditions under which a ag@@ glut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ er blood is achieved .
with others who are called &quot; in@@ completely &quot; can only be referred to in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or using other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ize on object dreams also homogen@@ ous red blood cells , which are w@@ asted in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may possibly change if the international standard prepar@@ es are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or several people , which are immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells , which contain the an@@ tigen , but not included with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood , which contain the an@@ tigen , but not included with human red blood cells , which do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
therefore , this ser@@ a are therefore specifically developed for the C @-@ an@@ tigen , when the tested blood cells are w@@ asted in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
the tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e blood cells .

&quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) should have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contained in any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ c and the speci@@ fic@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ e can be obtained directly from the blood immun@@ ised persons or can be manufactured by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time at the same time .
if a serum is intended for use on property sheets according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time should show the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time in all kinds of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not less than with the ant@@ ech@@ less antibodies .
