the effectiveness of the ser@@ um may not be less than 64 international units per ml .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Blood serum is also an easily recogni@@ z@@ able ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) .
if an anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on a slide board with the same amount of 5- and A2 blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within the double time , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ A blood group body or with a standard pre@@ par@@ at equal activity .

some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ize on object dreams also homogen@@ ous red blood cells , which are w@@ asted in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may possibly change if the international standard prepar@@ es are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or several people , which are immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells , which contain the an@@ tigen , but not included with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood , which contain the an@@ tigen , but not included with human red blood cells , which do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
therefore , this ser@@ a are therefore specifically developed for the C @-@ an@@ tigen , when the tested blood cells are w@@ asted in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
the tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e blood cells .

&quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) should have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contained in any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ c and the speci@@ fic@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ e can be obtained directly from the blood immun@@ ised persons or can be manufactured by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time at the same time .
if a serum is intended for use on property sheets according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time should show the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time in all kinds of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not less than with the ant@@ ech@@ less antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immune to blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
