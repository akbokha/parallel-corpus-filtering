A@@ bil@@ isi is used for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes and prevention episodes of patients who have spoken in the past to the medicine .
injection solution is used for fast control of distur@@ b@@ ance or behavi@@ our@@ al problems when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
in both cases , the solution for adjusting or hot plates in patients can be applied to those of tablets .
in patients who receive other medicines that use the same as A@@ bil@@ ical , the dose should be adjusted from A@@ bil@@ isi .
this imp@@ airs signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ itter , &quot; i.e. , chemical substances which enable the communication of nerve cells among themselves .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably affects the recept@@ ors for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ ine ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ itter , in order to activate the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine is an important role in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in addition to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or lack of symptoms and you will be repe@@ ating .
efficacy of A@@ bil@@ isi to prevent symptoms occur in three trials up to one year .
the efficacy of injection solution was compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar ill@@ nesses that compared to a placebo over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bil@@ isi reported about twelve weeks of 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ ical and placebo which had already been stabil@@ ized on 160 patients who had already been stabil@@ ized with aspects .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ isi inj@@ ector solution was compared to a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another Anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment .
in addition , the company also led studies to examine how the body &apos;s melting tablets and solution to influence is absorbed ( takes up ) .
in both studies with the injection solution showed patients that received A@@ bil@@ isi in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms resulting un@@ rest than those who received a placebo .
in use for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bil@@ isi was more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ bi@@ polar symptoms .
A@@ bil@@ isi prevented for up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo which was previously treated with previously treated patients and when in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bil@@ isi inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms marked un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of A@@ bil@@ i ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , breach , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , breach , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , sor@@ ption ( nau@@ sea ) , sor@@ ption ( nau@@ sea ) , s@@ wis@@ s ( sleep distur@@ bed ) , in@@ som@@ uch ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxi@@ ety .
at the conclusion that the advantages of ap@@ olog@@ op@@ hren@@ ia ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of chor@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and the prevention of a new man@@ ian episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ age@@ ous episodes on the treatment with arias , compared to the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ical episodes if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued the European Commission to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . an approval for placing changes in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is the treatment of constant up to severe episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new religious episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ age@@ ous episodes and their lack of episodes on the treatment with arias ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
a increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although single patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mono@@ therap@@ ies or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with the response to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ icides behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ecting disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of ep@@ idemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased risk risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole gave a comparison to other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease , cer@@ vical suff@@ iciency ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , Hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ ed and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ o@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occas@@ ional items about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or reduce the treatment .
if a patient concerns signs and symptoms developed to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ er in the An@@ am@@ nese or at state @-@ of @-@ associations that are used with cl@@ amp@@ er in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years old with arias in patients with psych@@ osis who have been associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with arias with arias , an elevated risk of death compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study involving fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted de@@ fi@@ v@@ ascular events in patients with arias treated patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases is extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ des or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents of patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , and weakness . patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the gl@@ ucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole the central nerv@@ ous system is necessary , if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alized pharmaceutical products such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid block@@ ers , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective in@@ hibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose @-@ reductions .
for CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result in higher plasma concentration of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ as compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 compatible Met@@ abol@@ ism .
if you consider the common administration of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should weigh potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV protein inhibit@@ ors , would have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose @-@ reductions .
after depos@@ ed the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
di@@ lem@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , with a constant increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of arias per day showed no significant effect on Met@@ abol@@ ism of the substr@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 method@@ ology ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ ki ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform her doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the in@@ adequate data of security in humans and due to the re@@ productive studies at the animal , this drug may not be applied in the pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is definitely the potential risk for the F@@ öt@@ us .
however , in other non @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , the patients should be warned against service , including power vehicles , including power vehicles , to use until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below are defined in accordance with the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ ak@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ering , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients who were treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was under placebo in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with arias and 15,@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ical episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % was reported in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under a lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters found , no medi@@ cally meaning@@ ful differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mptom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ as treated patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to adverse events that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , don@@ key disease and cr@@ amp@@ ra@@ ids , un@@ wanted shred@@ ded v@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ do@@ si@@ fications with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and observed without death .
although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is un@@ likely that hem@@ at@@ yl@@ ac@@ tics has a high plasma integration in the treatment of an over@@ dose .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of arias in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ore and to the Hist@@ amin @-@ H1@@ receptor .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a half @-@ phase controlled study , 52 of the proportion of patients who held a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ yl@@ 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values of measured data were defined as secondary study data , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ h scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an os@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with more flexible dosage over 3 weeks of patients with a man@@ ical or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed a placebo over placebo over placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage of patients with a man@@ ical or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I failure to placebo had no superior efficacy .
in two placebo and actively controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ical or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a higher effect compared to placebo which was comparable with lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed 12 comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic remission of the Man@@ y on such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .

at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there is no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as at a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic examination sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics revealed no evidence on clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of the rob@@ otic to the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ arias was similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with different common liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to draw shots on their met@@ abolic capacity .

Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occas@@ ional items about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing awareness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , swe@@ ating and di@@ arr@@ hyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , and weakness . patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the gl@@ ucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , and could lead to serious complications .

in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and behavi@@ our@@ al problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant increase in symptoms with regard to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ ity reference arm .
the average settlement observed from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ itement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 to placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for arias .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar efficacy in relation to the overall population was observed , but statistical significance could be noted due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .

the effectiveness of the Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were used to obtain anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all some gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in relation to the efficacy of the disease and survival between the medicines .
in contrast to patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane is more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing pharmac@@ euticals .
in addition , it may not be used to treat patients , or have low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic numbers in the blood before the beginning of the treatment .
the Medic@@ inal Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) noted that the first treatment does not beat any more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing pharmac@@ euticals and that in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el they do not have to contain other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission announced the Security Council Bi@@ os@@ c@@ ience Limited for the placing of the placing by Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not shown for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( Neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ ev , &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or heavier neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y degree 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until a improvement is reached on degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is currently no suff@@ iciently data to the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ exist@@ ent data for un@@ certainty and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ sis form of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el who could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sy@@ mptom@@ atic treatment is treated , and the patient must not be treated again with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no need to be re@@ launched , until the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ev has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ at number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with heavy liver function ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a uni@@ qu@@ ent with Abra@@ x@@ ane was not detected in connection of car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents are not unusual , especially in patients with former anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ emet@@ ic and constant means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used with pregnant or women in fried age , not to be used , except the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is ir@@ reversible .
women in the heated age should be used during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable verification method of use .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is enriched , during and up to six months after the treatment no child bear witness .
male patients should be advised before the treatment via a sperm contra@@ ction , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause adverse events such as fatigue ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) , which can act on traffic noise and ability to serve machines .
following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of adverse events which resulted in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly dependent reversible ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of the treated patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in table 1 , adverse events are listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mono@@ therap@@ ist in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , elevated blood sugar , elevated blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :

pain in the chest of the mus@@ cul@@ ature , weakness of mus@@ cular pain , pain pain , mus@@ cular pain , pain in the sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , dis@@ comfort in the muscles , muscle weak@@ nesses Very frequently :
ru@@ hel@@ o@@ fluid 1 The frequency of over@@ sensitivity actions is calculated based on a defined case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
since these events have been reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no problem related to these events .
P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a Anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli drug which contributes to the interaction of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli and stabil@@ izes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ isation .
this stabil@@ ization leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ al inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ m@@ osis medi@@ ates in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies was demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in transports the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ th@@ eli@@ or@@ tic transport caused by g@@ p @-@ 60 Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ ws and due to the en @-@ binding protein SP@@ ARC ( under@@ ted egg aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el Ac@@ cum@@ ulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ blind studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy of 175 mg / m2 in form of solvent containing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute infusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ acted general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ esters .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response time and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ line treatment are placed below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity over P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by a degree of patients receiving a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y degree 3 .
peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of the aggregate P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in the 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usi@@ ons of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the efficiency exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 In patients with metastatic breast cancer in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration increased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant distribution and / or gra@@ ding connection of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced sound tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of up@@ x@@ ane compared with a 3 @-@ hour inj@@ ections of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the cle@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ gift ( 43 % ) and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ biology and tissue coating , P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el has been met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed in the first line to 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of carbohydr@@ ate in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urea was less than 1 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ am@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ aring .
more than patients at the age of 75 , however , only few dates are available , as only 3 patients participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was measured at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ proof for 8 hours before light .

• School brochure • Sum@@ mary of the Charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of the drugs ( technical information ) , labelling and packing density . • With unique representation of the correct application of the product for transportation through the patient .
this means that Ab@@ ove is similar to an organic medic@@ inal product that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference rates &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal ble@@ eding values , in which a blood loss of blood may occur if a blood loss is not possible and a loss of blood from 900 to 1 800 ml are expected .
treatment with ab@@ outs must be led under the supervision of a physician , who owns the experience in the treatment of patients with illness for which the medicine is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a V@@ ene .
injection can also be done by the patient or of his coun@@ sel@@ or , if they receive an appropriate guide .
patients with chronic kidney failure or patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are subjected to the treatment to ensure that no iron defic@@ iency should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in@@ defic@@ iency , or thereby that the body is not enough for the body &apos;s own Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in is also applied to operations in order to increase the number of red blood cells , thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced to the formation of ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ ly was reported in administration as inj@@ ector in a major study involving 479 patients who caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems . compared to reference problems .
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before they have been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before they were either charged or E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s between the beginning of the study and the duration period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
furthermore , the company also submitted the results of a study where the effects of under the skin spra@@ yed from E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s of patients were observed in the same size as in those patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase of blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to sympt@@ om of a En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ating mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ awe@@ ed must not be applied in patients which may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or one of the other components .
secre@@ tion under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems because further studies are required to ensure that this is triggered by no allergic reactions .
the Medic@@ inal Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the drug has been certified according to the regulations of the European Union of evidence that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
angi@@ pur@@ ities and tor@@ tured changes can be different depending on age , gender and total disease of disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and diseases are required by the doctor .
a rise of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) should be avoided over a period of four weeks .
due to the variation of the vari@@ ability between patients can occasionally be observed with individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values over or below the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bi@@ vari@@ ability should be tried to reach hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s exceeds over 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin coefficient is over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored and monitored in order to ensure that Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is required in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and mi@@ a@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher detection rate than patients where the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher detection rate than patients where the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .

infection symptoms and other diseases can be different depending on age , gender and total disease of disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and diseases are required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bi@@ vari@@ ability should be tried to reach hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be monitored and monitored in order to ensure that Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is required in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of the mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ders increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the ret@@ ik@@ o@@ zy@@ ten@@ ess increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl to the initial value , the dose should be retained per week or 450 mg / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the ret@@ ina amount of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl increased compared with the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 ct@@ l / kg three times a week .

patients with light an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre@@ heated storage of ≥ 4 blood @-@ con@@ es is required , should be given a dose of 600 mg / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to operative procedure .
with the iron subst@@ itution should begin as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ ologist ble@@ eding program - that , before the onset of the sw@@ ing@@ le @-@ therapy and large iron reserves are available .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 mg / kg ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , which once a week passed over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operative procedure and the date of surgery ( day 0 ) .
the ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 i.e. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of intervention as well as 4 days immediately after the surgery .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after the exchange years as well as men .
it is applied in patients with a high risk of risk ( bone b@@ lows ) , including patients who suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ s such as the hat@@ ch ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease which changed the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hat@@ ch@@ ase should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) , or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , in the three days after the infusion of symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ ometric , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was attracted by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis was involved , and it was examined the number of verteb@@ rates and hip fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis more than 50 years , who had recently suffered a stro@@ kes ; it was investigated by the number of fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in addition , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies at a total of 357 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the content of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme , the bone sub@@ stan@@ z is de@@ centr@@ alised ) in the blood , or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without any oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ e@@ era ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ e@@ era ) , those under placebo was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a questionn@@ aire ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequent with repeated inf@@ usi@@ ons .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients that may be sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the infusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a represents re@@ conn@@ aissance material ready to use the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients where the medicine &apos;s side effects should be explained and pointed out when they should consult the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission distributed to the companies Nov@@ art@@ is Europ@@ harm Limited for placing the placing of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis • at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • In men with increased risk for fra@@ c@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic rec@@ ti@@ fication .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis and oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in men is recommended an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic rec@@ ti@@ fication , the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after operating power supply ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long R@@ emis@@ si@@ vity was observed in patients who have been addressed to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advis@@ able , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , correspon@@ d@@ ingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent un@@ disp@@ uted low @-@ trau@@ matic rec@@ ti@@ fication , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. recommended or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced by the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as a limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary since the bio availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients similar to younger is .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data are missing and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for these patient population are only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ cal@@ z@@ emia is treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a therapy before the onset of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to rapid insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure can develop a temporary , mit@@ igation of sy@@ mptom@@ atic hypo@@ cal@@ am@@ emia which usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advis@@ able , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , correspon@@ d@@ ingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be treated with adequate dental treatment in front of an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
for patients who need dental surgery , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduced the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the pine zone .
the clinical evaluation by the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced by the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the pre@@ valence of serious adverse events reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) in comparison to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 852 ) .
in oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ ine fra@@ cture trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was the total hardness of pre@@ ferences between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occas@@ ional ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ desirable medicines are listed in Table 1 .
kidney failure of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which expressed as a decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ ine ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure , in connection .
the change of cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were similar to oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in a clinical study between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ ine within 10 days of the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary calcium @-@ values which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , at 2.3 % of treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated patients .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in the study on avoi@@ ding clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a stroke and in the mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a recent attack , the vitamin D mirror not measured rout@@ in@@ ely , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported by local reactions at the infusion , such as valve , sw@@ elling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the field of terrain , especially in cancer patients , over oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the field of pine ) reported that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had evidence of local infections including oste@@ op@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients after Zah@@ nex@@ tra@@ ctions or other dental surgery .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in an area with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and a placebo treated with placebo .
in case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clinical hypo@@ cal@@ an@@ emia can be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous infusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( PFT ) - The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or a moderate @-@ existing verteb@@ rates , or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of existing sp@@ ells .
effects on morph@@ ometric cycl@@ ine A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a significantly reduced significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk for cycl@@ or@@ tions compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip hop A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a constant effect over three years , that resulted in a 41 % CI ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip fra@@ c@@ tures .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the l@@ um@@ bar ic acid , hi@@ ps and the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo @-@ treatment significantly ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 % of the bone density of the l@@ um@@ bar sp@@ ine by 6.7 % , the total stro@@ kes of 6.0 % , the body weight by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were obtained after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vic sponge .
a micro @-@ computer@@ ized tom@@ y ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the bone architecture .
bone tumor markers ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of type @-@ I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) serum samples were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the period of time period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced the B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were measured not rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before the infusion .
the total mort@@ al was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment with the BM@@ D on the total hardness and string quartet to all times .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment carried out more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the total hardness and 4.3 % on the body weight .
clinical efficacy in males In the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study , 508 were randomised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; incidence of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures was 7.5 % near A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in a different study in males ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was related to the percentage percentage of the percentage of l@@ um@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was investigated in patients and patients with radi@@ ological Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum @-@ mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold of age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison with intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months , was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease of pain strength and pain was observed after 6 months in comparison with the output value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ sibility at the end of the six @-@ month study ( on the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients , the therapeutic address could be treated at 141 of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 of patients with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients , with a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ one and multiple 5 and 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usi@@ ons of 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical data that were recognised as dos@@ is@@ an independently .
after that , the plasma weight decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
R@@ asch@@ al bi@@ phase dis@@ appearance of the large cycle with half times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a terminal elim@@ ination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the re@@ tention of the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the accumulated dose is found in the ur@@ ine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the whole body cle@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentrations by 30 % at the end of the infusion , but had no effect on the surface under the turn ( plasma concentration on time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzy@@ mes met@@ alli@@ zed substances is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed because it is not a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , nitrogen @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) demonstrated the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance , and at the 64 examined patients in the mean age of 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
it yields that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function up to a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance down to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
as for severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data are not possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ tu@@ ous intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies in dogs , single doses ranging from 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C 6@@ times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without ren@@ al contamination .
sub@@ sid@@ y and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered by a dose of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute infusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered at intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human therapeutic exposure to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , corresponds to ) .

according to the CH@@ MP guideline for human @-@ risk management systems , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( PS@@ UR ) . &quot;
a re@@ working R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could influence current statements on safety , pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ize risk provisions . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone was achieved ( for pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) . • On request the EMEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic is a representative of a sub@@ class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
decl@@ ining blood mirror of sex hormon@@ es , especially est@@ rogen , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gen@@ eic acid , plays an role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
when the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure to quickly , and new bone material is un@@ arranged , which makes the bone material weak@@ ened than normal .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a appears to norm@@ alize the bone structure again , thereby a normal bone formation ensure that the bones gives strength again strength .
if you are in dental surgery or dental surgery , please inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or n@@ urs@@ ing staff , if you use other drugs / apply or used , even if it is not pres@@ cription drugs .
for your doctor it is especially important to know if you are using medicines that they are re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed for the kidneys .
using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a together with food supplies and drink , you worry about that you should take enough liquid before and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is given to you by your doctor or n@@ urs@@ ing staff as infusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have broken the hip , it is recommended to submit the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operating power of the hip .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public . this document is a summary of the European Public Service Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the studies carried out on Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) carried out the study carried out in order to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It is not shown in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a diabet@@ ic medication ) can not be applied . • It can be used together with other diabet@@ ic medicine .
in addition to Met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , the met@@ form@@ in is not satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose alone .
in combination with a sulph@@ ate resin or insulin can be maintained the previous dose of sulph@@ ide @-@ fuels or insulin @-@ insulin . in case of patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sulph@@ ide resin or insulin is to be reduced .
this means that the physical insulin can be used better and the blood sugar level drops , thus making type 2 diabetes better .
for more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ ide resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ ca@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how good blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which means that the blood sugar levels were lowered with the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ bal therapy trial , the effect of an additional administration of acet@@ one for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ur resin in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients , patients who had an additional insulin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events in the context of Ac@@ tos were vision@@ aries , infections of the upper respir@@ atory ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients either against Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or diabet@@ ic acid ( high blood mirror - acidity level ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , using Met@@ form@@ in in patients .
in October 2000 , the European Commission announced the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing an account for the placing of cars in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to wh@@ it@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate , and in which met@@ form@@ ations is in@@ adequate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age are not available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who end@@ anger@@ ed at least one risk factor ( e.g. from previous heart attack or sy@@ mptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain or furn@@ aces , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserves .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain and furn@@ aces are observed when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in combination with insulin is applied .
a cardi@@ ac study Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing un@@ itary disease was carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports about con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range ) or with other signs of a liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are increased , the liver values are as soon as possible .
if a patient developed symptoms that refer to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ ch problems , ti@@ red@@ ness , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are to check the liver data .
the decision on whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the submission of the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , dos@@ ed weight gain has been detected , which can stir in fat @-@ deposits , and is associated with a fluid re@@ tention in some cases .
as a result of a hem@@ oph@@ l@@ ution , under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the average reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin &apos;s disease by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin @-@ sensitivity , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is treated as an oral branch or triple combination therapy with a sulph@@ ide @-@ resin or as a dual combination therapy with insulin @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
following the market launch , under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , over a occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a diabet@@ ic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction of visual acuity was reported .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ on if patients should report on inter@@ ruption in visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ic information should be considered .
in a summary analysis of Mess@@ ages from randomised controlled trials , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients that were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
the calculated questionn@@ aire was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures for 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative media .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years on the study of cardiovascular disease , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative media .
patients should be aware of a pregnancy or if a patient wishes a pregnancy or enter the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies in interaction of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phenol and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. oral contrast agents , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhibit@@ or are not expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around the 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 54 % .
this is due to the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ vis@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin @-@ resistant viruses and thus reduces the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the red@@ dish growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tower and refra@@ ctive index of lens as they can also be observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic active ingredients .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ st@@ ents represented over three times the upper limit of the standard area often just as under Placebo , but more rarely than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fi@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ material .
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of a severe con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
since the market launch , rarely more than cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency has been reported , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in combination with insulin @-@ suff@@ iciency was applied in the An@@ am@@ nese in combination with insulin @-@ suff@@ iciency .
it was an summar@@ izing analysis of un@@ wanted events concerning bone mar@@ ches from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with comparative groups .
in the over a period of 3.5 years , fra@@ c@@ tures stood at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative media .
taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms appeared .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to work on an activation of specific kernel receptor ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin @-@ sensitive skin of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ etal cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces gl@@ ucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral Glu@@ cos@@ ity in case of insulin @-@ resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as Mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be evaluated by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were random@@ ly adjusted using insulin @-@ sensitive optim@@ isation , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who still only received insulin @-@ treatment in the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one group .
in clinical trials over one year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , there was a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ ine quota in comparison to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mono@@ therap@@ ies with 45 mg versus Pl@@ az@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 @-@ diabet@@ ics .
in most clinical trials , placebo had a reduction of total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and a slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to Pl@@ az@@ ebo , there was no statistically significant increase of LD@@ L cholesterol while under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d reduced values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one did not only increase tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de level , but also improved tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de level , this is also an effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the Pro@@ active study , a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ous Out@@ come study , 52 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized in groups that were randomised to either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
according to oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one becomes fast res@@ or@@ able , whereby the peak concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma is usually 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal pronounced .
in Inter@@ action studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phenol and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one on humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the scale ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elim@@ ination life of un@@ changeable Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in healthy volunteers with reduced kidney function , but the rates of oral cle@@ ance of the matern@@ ity is similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys conform to repeated administration plasma enlargement with hem@@ oph@@ l@@ ution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac t@@ rophy .
this is due to the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one who reduces hyper@@ anc@@ ill@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin @-@ resistant viruses and thus reduces the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the red@@ dish growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induced by hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of ur@@ inary bladder epi@@ thel@@ ium .
in a animal model of family om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ ons led to an increased frequency of colonies .

the calculated questionn@@ aire was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures for 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative media .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years on the study of cardiovascular disease , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative media .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , there was a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ ine quota in comparison to the output values .
in a study over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was not only the so@@ ber tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de level , but also improved tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de level , this is an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .

the study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ ca@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how good blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els that indicate that the blood gl@@ ucose levels have been reduced similar to another human @-@ insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients that might be sensitive ( allergic ) on human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
Moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane must be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to be found ) .
the Committee on Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was overweight in the treatment of diabetes compared with the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission announced Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for placing the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane into the entire European Union .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients that may be sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may also be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can express itself on the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission announced Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for placing the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are shu@@ ff@@ led , first the amount of the insulin must be pulled up , then the amount of long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in patients a dose adap@@ tion is necessary , this may be necessary during the first dose or months after the conversion .
prior to travel , which should go over several time zones , the patient should bring to the advice of his doctor , as such journeys can be used , or taken insulin and meals at other times or taken .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mol / l ) with 204 diabet@@ ic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabet@@ ic patients showed that an intraven@@ ous acet@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mol / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabet@@ ic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and youth ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already received call@@ ings of cryst@@ all@@ ings , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in joints ) or gyp@@ sies ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger Ur@@ at@@ ine deposits , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary acid lies two to four weeks more than 6 mg per dec@@ ah@@ ites , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment months , there are still tox@@ icity cases ; therefore , the patient is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic must take further medicines for prevention of tox@@ icity cases .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , participated in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three @-@ Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( one of other medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary bladder had in the blood with the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients who Aden@@ ur@@ ic had a dose of 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once a day consume 120 mg , in the last three measurements , in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac disease , an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the conclusion of human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood of ur@@ inary acid in the blood , as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels could be prevented .

the lowering of the serum acid to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the physician attendance during the week 2 and permanently keep the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ purple in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um@@ incre@@ at@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the under@@ group of patients with kidney limitation The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney limitations ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary interest rate was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage of the process of serum acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with heavy kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the under@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of about 40 % of patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years showed that the permanent lowering of the serum levels showed up to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mol / l ) , that fewer than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 resulted in an treatment against a ple@@ a ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a ple@@ a ) .
this was associated with a reduction of gyp@@ sum size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of gyp@@ sum no@@ des up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .

for doses between 120 mg and 300 m@@ g. a rise of AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
according to the intake of simple or multiple doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in the serum levels of serum acid concentrations observed , if this was examined ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in the treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where a risk for low vitamin D mirrors .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before meal , drink or use of other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , Calcium , and Vit@@ amin@@ ases ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the meal , the patient may not apply until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 is already separated from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in relation to the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D spi@@ ke .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirrors were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than those who are exclusively at Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data to present that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain reduction , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( intest@@ inal disorders ) , const@@ ants ( Ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ es ( stro@@ kes ) , trimm@@ ed abdom@@ en ( puff@@ ed abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ fier .
in patients with horizontal sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it may not be applied at diseases of the meal , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium @-@ level ) or in patients who can not stand up at least 30 minutes .

the following references are accurate to decrease the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be caught on the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient should not cut the tablet or the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patient should not take place before the first dietary intake of the day that should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects seems to be increased in patients that use the medicine and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms which refer to a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing assign@@ ments should be transferred to the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .

clinical evaluation by the treated doctor is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the patients should be referred to by taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet should be taken in the next morning after they notice their se@@ clu@@ sion .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D defic@@ iency and h@@ yp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ als can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients have to wait at least 30 minutes after intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at least before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients receiving a kidney or liver tran@@ spl@@ ant to prevent the transplan@@ ted organ through the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been deployed in the EU , the company submitted the results from previously carried out by pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study was submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
principal Indi@@ c@@ ator of efficacy was the number of patients where the transplan@@ tation was gra@@ ded after a treatment duration of a year ( considering such a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a revival of di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) .
in addition , recent studies in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant were performed and examined , as in the case of pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .
Tre@@ mor ( cit@@ rus ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ lip@@ tic ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) as well as ins@@ om@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with horizontal sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , mac@@ ro@@ id antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or one of the other components may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful if others ( especially some vegetable ) drugs can be taken at the same time with C@@ agra@@ f , since the Adv@@ ant@@ aneous dose or the dose of the same time can be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with the immune @-@ intensive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ ts patients should make this medication or make changes in the immune @-@ intensive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ aging .
patients should always be kept the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out in the tran@@ spl@@ ant control of a medical transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a result of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will remain .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based on clinical assessment of output and toler@@ ability in individual cases and blood levels ( see below &quot; recommendations )
after change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after change@@ over .
on Day 4 the system@@ ic exposition was measured as a valley mirror , with both formulation and kidney transplan@@ ts .
careful and repeated inspec@@ tions of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate reverse phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low cle@@ aring , can take a change of the Adv@@ oc@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in case of the patients in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow medication treatment intraven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an infusion solution ) , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be re@@ directed with a dose of ca .
duration of the application for suppression of transplan@@ tation must be reduced to immun@@ o ; it can therefore not be specified as a maximum duration of the oral therapy .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation of gra@@ ft reactions The or@@ al Adv@@ oc@@ cip@@ ation Therap@@ y should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift on the morning .
further dose adjustments can be necessary later , since the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ ization of patients after tran@@ spl@@ ant .
dose recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft reactions The or@@ al Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day than once daily gift on the morning .
Dos@@ age Recommended - Change from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted to a daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice daily taking a daily dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , in relation to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant After a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ res@@ s@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ f once daily , treatment with the recommended initial initi@@ ation dose for the proph@@ yl@@ ation of transplan@@ tation can begin .
for adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , a oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.15 mg / kg / kg daily can be taken once a day in the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant patients although there are no clinical experience with lung cancer , pan@@ cre@@ mat@@ ory and dar@@ mes in a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , at pan@@ cre@@ atic initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intest@@ inal transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dos@@ is@@ adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood levels in the as@@ pi@@ red area can be necessary in patients with heavy liver function dysfunction .
patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it may be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum @-@ incre@@ at@@ ine mirror , recommended for calculation of the cre@@ at@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) .
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f At the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ - based on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the bottom level in the blood level The dose should be based primarily on clinical evaluation of ab@@ normal@@ ization and toler@@ ability in single @-@ line fr@@ o @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks controls .
it is recommended to frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during the maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ ks from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change according to migration from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dos@@ is@@ adaptation , changes to the immune @-@ intensive therapy or for the use of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentrations ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with low cle@@ aring , the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State entered .
according to clinical studies , we conclu@@ de that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the Tal@@ ks should not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lie in full blood in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml , and with warm transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent development of liver , kidney disease and cardi@@ ac disease , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used .
this has resulted in serious events , including gra@@ ft reactions or other side effects , which can occur in a row of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposition .
patients should always be kept the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out in the tran@@ spl@@ ant control of a medical transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft reactions , which proved to be proven compared to other immun@@ os@@ res@@ s@@ va as therapy , there are currently no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft reactions to adult heart transplan@@ tation and Tran@@ splan@@ tation in childhood are currently no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to potential inter@@ actions which can lead to a down@@ gra@@ ding of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of vegetable ingredients ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) contain , or other plant remedy during treatment with advanced notification ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood mirror can be subjected to such circumstances on such circumstances .
in rare cases , aqu@@ eous humor or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ t@@ rophy was observed in rare cases , which is therefore possible to occur even under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors which increase the risk of such clinical dis@@ ruption , are already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid over@@ load and oil .
as with other immun@@ os@@ res@@ s@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection by means of a high protection factor .
when patients receiving Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us symptoms , symptoms of p@@ res such as head@@ aches , changing awareness of consciousness , forces and im@@ aging , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ina , l@@ act@@ ose included , is patient with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ act@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase defic@@ iency , l@@ act@@ ase defic@@ iency , or gl@@ ucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special attention .
the simultaneous use of medicines or plant agents that are known as a inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reducing blood values from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore advis@@ able to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood level when changing substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to exc@@ essive concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction was made with An@@ tim@@ ot@@ ica such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ id anti@@ bi@@ otic Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics studies that the increase of blood mirror mainly derived from the increased or@@ it@@ iner@@ ary of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by inhibit@@ ing the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal re@@ plac@@ eable changes .
high @-@ quality pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute remedy reactions , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with pharmac@@ euticals , which are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is affected .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us put down the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid @-@ contra@@ dic@@ tiv@@ a and thus increase the hormone exposition , is especially careful to act with decisions .
the results of animal try have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us would decrease the cle@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extending their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of investigations to tran@@ spl@@ ant patients deliver no evidence that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ res@@ s@@ va an increased risk for un@@ wanted events in terms of course and result of pregnancy .

chronic gra@@ ft reactions , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis fl@@ iter@@ acy syndrome , was often observed in the first year after the transplan@@ tation less frequently ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and 83 % in Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

us is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( one due to the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital ble@@ eding ) .
the dosage and frequency of the use should be addressed afterwards if Adv@@ ant@@ ate is used for the treatment of ble@@ eding or prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedure .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII defic@@ iency , which causes ble@@ eding problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA &quot; technology :
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced in the gene for the formation of the human being in the human being .
Adv@@ ant@@ ate is another registered product of the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , unlike , but it is produced differently , so the drugs do not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , among them one study with 53 children under six years , the application of medication was investigated for prevention of ble@@ eding as well as in surgical techniques .
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ance at the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood inc@@ in@@ kers with &quot; excellent &quot; or with &quot; good &quot; rated .
the most common adverse events of advanced ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Schwin@@ n , head@@ ache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ant@@ ate may not be applied to patients which may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against the human being factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission distributed to the Company B@@ ax@@ ter AG , approval for placing on the market in the entire European Union .
dosage : dosage and duration of the substr@@ ate therapy is based on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ defic@@ iency , after the place and the extent of ble@@ eding and the clinical condition of the patient .
at the following h@@ olog@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma bricks ( in % of the standard or i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , corresponding to the corresponding period ) .
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) repeat , until the danger is over by the patient .
during treatment course , a reasonable dose and frequency of inj@@ ections indicate an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma bricks .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ ids are not achieved or if the blood is not covered with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if necessary for a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures will need to be used .
the administration speed should be addressed according to the patient , whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing anti @-@ antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always protected against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine that are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is on the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ position @-@ positioning and an@@ am@@ ous @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product was observed , the recur@@ ren@@ ation of ( lowest tit@@ ors ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare adv@@ ancing of hem@@ oph@@ ilia A in women there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients showed inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have had a higher risk for formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) calculated . b ) The unexpected waste of the concentration factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els joined one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E @-@ In@@ fusion .
the blood circulation was discontinued during the whole time and the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values at the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic moderate to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da base ) .
in addition , no one of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and Diagnostics ( ≥ 50 % ) was determined by prior exposure to a factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients of a ongoing clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with a factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of cont@@ amin@@ ating proteins was analyzed by the investigation of the antibody tit@@ res against this proteins , laboratory and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a lasting peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell liver , otherwise no evidence or symptoms appeared on an allergic reaction or an over@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , Haut@@ r@@ ash , and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ oph@@ ile Gran@@ ul@@ o@@ zy@@ tes during several repet@@ itive product positions in the study was reported .

the p@@ 53 protein , which is made of non @-@ def@@ ectives in the human body is normally made from damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not correct but the cancer cells can grow forward and split .
the company submitted data from a study involving a patient at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ mining , in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP , after the company had examined the questions on which submitted questions , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on the testing of initially submitted documents , CH@@ MP is created on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
after the CH@@ MP view of the CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ ec@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors has been benefits for the patient .
the Committee also concerns concerns relating to the processing of medicines in the body , the type of administration and safety of medication .
Moreover , the company had not suff@@ iciently proven that Adv@@ ec@@ in can be made in reliable ways , and that it is neither for the environment even for people who are in contact with the patient .
the company put the CH@@ MP not aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ec@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed effects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are thus assembled that one of the most effective components is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze becomes the treatment of symptoms of the seas@@ onally allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay car@@ p ) , caused by an allerg@@ y against poll@@ en @-@ sigh@@ ed inflamm@@ ation of the nose ( ur@@ ged nose ) in patients .
in adults and adolescents ages 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and finished , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( viol@@ ated nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be found on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main basic deviations were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the Heu@@ schn@@ u@@ pf@@ r@@ aments symptoms that were reported in the treatment before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients showed their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale such as serious symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all loc@@ ari@@ ous symptoms , the patient reported the disease reported , the Aer@@ in@@ aze grew , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.9 % in patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es were considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common adverse events of aer@@ os@@ cope ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ ometer , sw@@ ing@@ ness , di@@ chlor@@ g@@ itis ( appet@@ ite ) , const@@ ip@@ ation , fatigue , in@@ som@@ uch ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , Som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be sensitive to patients who may possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ore agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied .
Aer@@ in@@ aze cannot be used in patients who suffer from hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ) or already a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) or had a risk for a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission announced the SP Europe approval approval for the placing on the market of aer@@ ospace in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is possible to swal@@ low up or cut it in the whole .
Aer@@ in@@ ert should not be used for children under the age of 12 due to the lack of data to in@@ compreh@@ en@@ ness and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time for 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin may take time .
after reducing the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory due to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mono@@ therap@@ ist .
da Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , the medicine is also indicated for patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy .
this is based on the alph@@ am@@ im@@ et@@ ical activity in combination with other v@@ aso@@ con@@ stri@@ cken as Bro@@ mo@@ cyclo@@ pit@@ in , Per@@ go@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other decades of dec@@ on@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ op@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ases , ep@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rin , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ ard , etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient &apos;s anatom@@ ical and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
security and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function not tested and the data is not sufficient to arrange corresponding recommendations for the dosage .
the patients must be informed that the treatment with the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ ometer , cardi@@ ac disease , nau@@ sea or et@@ w@@ ai@@ gen in other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients under D@@ IG@@ IT@@ AL@@ IS • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ nese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder instruction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the An@@ am@@ nese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is able to depos@@ ed at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ inated , otherwise positive reactions to prevent skin reaction or decrease in their extent .
in the framework of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ dens@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ edel@@ ic testing , no significant differences were detected between the patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and treated with placebo independent of them whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzyme was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs can not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a substr@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ compatibility of the application of aerob@@ atics during pregnancy is not secured , experience gained from a large number of pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increasing the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the incidence of normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the v@@ as@@ con@@ stri@@ v@@ icious properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , the patients should however be clari@@ fied in very rare cases , that can result in very rare cases , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart circulation coll@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS @-@ stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , conv@@ ents ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ies .

a tick @-@ stim@@ ulation is particularly likely to children especially as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il , and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ or@@ ic cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stic cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the inhibit@@ ing of expression of the adhes@@ ion P sel@@ f@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of flight performance including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ j@@ ections or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of beats compared to placebo was determined .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage may show more sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ ometer , or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS exc@@ itement .
it took 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 414 patients aerob@@ ic tablets received .
in both studies , the hist@@ amin@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist effectiveness of aerob@@ ic tablets , determined based on the overall level of symptoms ( except for nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ati@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined based on the nose @-@ mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine on the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic groups .
within a single dose study to pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ aze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was reached on day 10 .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic multi@@ disciplinary study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , was determined that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin po@@ or@@ ly di@@ ver@@ ly di@@ ver@@ tively .
a components inter@@ actions study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin is bio@@ equivalent to the exposure to a Aer@@ in@@ ox tablet .
based on conventional studies on the security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity at repeated administration , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin however don &apos;t recognize any special haz@@ ards for people .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the effects observed stood in general in connection with the content of pseud@@ oph@@ onic rin .
in re@@ productive @-@ physi@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was not weighed in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

for children aged between one and five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day taken in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup bz@@ w .
for children from six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup bz@@ w .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergi@@ en@@ itis and two studies on patients who had also As@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of gu@@ ards , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup and the solution for adjusting and melting tablets in the same way equ@@ ates the tablets and the use of children un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us became an average decline of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to a decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia the decrease of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo patients .
A@@ eri@@ us cannot be applied in patients which may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission announced the SP Europe approval approval for the placing on the market of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to the reduction of symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical studies on the efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for teenagers aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be taken according to the previous illness and can be resum@@ ed after the sound of symptoms .
in persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during the allergi@@ es of a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ yn@@ ological study , intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol has not been strengthened the performance effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , the patients should however be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases , that can result in very rare cases , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to serve machines .
in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us when patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were reported more than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mou@@ th@@ iness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse events was treated with 5.9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were administered , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ or@@ ic cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stic cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the inhibit@@ ing of expression of the adhes@@ ion P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was administered over 14 days a day , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ yn@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals showed itself .
with a single dos@@ sier , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes of flight performance including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ j@@ ectives or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the lens of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and ju@@ ck@@ ering of the nose , it@@ ching in@@ flow and tube of eyes as well as ju@@ ck@@ ering on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ onally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
according to the overall situation of the questionn@@ aire to life quality at Rhin@@ o @-@ economic tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us reduces the pollution caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia was representative for other forms of Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia , as the underlying Path@@ ophysi@@ ology was similar to the e@@ ti@@ ology of different forms , and chronic patients can be pro@@ lon@@ ely pro@@ spective .
since the hist@@ amin@@ ant factor is expected to be a critical factor in all ur@@ ari@@ ous diseases , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also expected to improve the symptoms of Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia in other forms of Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the amount of qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval .
like in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ mat@@ ory of chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics study where patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved .
there are no indications for a clinical relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , the enzyme responsible for Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzyme was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs will not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhibit@@ or in vivo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a substr@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ sier with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg total meals ( fet@@ al , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) not on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the clinical trials carried out by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin carried out by a comparative degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ ic@@ acy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and from Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies on the security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ists , pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ es do not recognize any special haz@@ ards for people .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescribed doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are pre@@ valent that support a treatment of inf@@ ectious rhin@@ itis in A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ al@@ ies should play the An@@ am@@ nese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory and skin investigations .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zes Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and find out a higher subject load ( see section 5.2 ) .
safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of age , restricted to met@@ abolic , is identical to the children that met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zes normal .
this medication contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inher@@ ited problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , gl@@ ucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ absor@@ p@@ tion@@ sh@@ em@@ ary or a suc@@ rose content in@@ suff@@ iciency should not take this product .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were detected in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ yn@@ ological study , intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol does not ampli@@ fied the performance effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total hardness of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were administered , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who came to a anti@@ hist@@ am@@ inated therapy , received a daily dose of dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in the framework of a clinical study involving multiple outlets in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day applied for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ a@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days when adults was applied , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents has no increased frequency of beats compared to placebo .
during a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets conducted in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ edel@@ ic .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was neither the simultaneous intake of alcohol either to a ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced performance defic@@ iency .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets became effective in the lens of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching in@@ flow and tube of eyes as well as ju@@ ck@@ ering on the pal@@ ate .
according to the overall score of the questionn@@ aire to life quality at Rhin@@ o @-@ economic tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively assi@@ mil@@ ated by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the amount of qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restri@@ ct phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable with adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ cas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic parameters were in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was approximately 6 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older men to protect the flu caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine , which could cause a trunk of flu , which could cause a future pan@@ demic .
a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ ic epidemic breaks out when a new trunk of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus can be found slightly from human being , because people still don &apos;t have immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
following administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus as &quot; physical @-@ foreign &quot; and is antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later , in a contact with a flu virus of this family .
then the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ es of the membran@@ es that det@@ ects the human body is ab@@ hor@@ ted ) separated , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
in this way , the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient to comply with the requirements of the EMEA region to comply with the requirements of the EMEA region for pre@@ pan@@ ic vacc@@ ines .

it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years treated with the human immun@@ ode@@ ficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are infected with the acquired immun@@ ode@@ ficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase can be used as a solution , but they cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be classified if the doctor has checked the an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient previously taken , and the probability that the virus is talking to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with 100 mg of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
in children between the ages of four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gen@@ ase reduces HIV @-@ quantity in the blood in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines at low level .
AIDS is not able to heal AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system and so that the development of AIDS linked infections and diseases can also be used .
A@@ gen@@ ase has been investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which previously did not have been treated with proteins .
this drug increased with low @-@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced A@@ gen@@ ase in 206 adults , previously compared with other prot@@ eas@@ ants .
principal Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of vir@@ al load after the treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously taken no proteins after 48 weeks , more patients had one vir@@ al load below 400 copies / ml as under placebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ us@@ last , but with the children that had been treated with prot@@ otyp@@ ic numbers , only very few were addressed to the treatment .
in the study with adults , previously treated with protein numbers were treated with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced A@@ gen@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other prot@@ eas@@ ants :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other proteins of proteins , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger tr@@ ash of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in patients who continued their previous proteins :
the most common adverse events of as@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( blood par@@ aly@@ sis ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash , and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied to patients which may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ j@@ avi@@ or or one of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a plant preparation for treatment of depression ) or medicines that are just like as@@ gen@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other drugs against HIV , A@@ gen@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) or a immune activ@@ iti@@ ate ( symptoms of an infection that caused the rest@@ or@@ tive immune system ) .
at the end , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic amplifiers of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously taken no proteins .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission distributed to G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for placing the placing on the market of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- in@@ classified , proteins and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic boo@@ stered by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ ca@@ r should be used under consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance samples and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio availability of Am@@ b@@ ca@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ b@@ ca@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the increased additive of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses have to be applied to as@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ b@@ ca@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to be exceeded , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins were not investigated in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for the use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data to un@@ certainty and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data , the dose to A@@ gen@@ ase capsules in adult patients with medium @-@ serious liver function was reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver function ( 300 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous application should be performed in patients with light or less liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .

vegetable preparations , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated date ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a healing of the HIV infection , and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infection or other complications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase prevents the risk of transfer from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , have an increased risk for heavy liver impacts with potentially fatal course .

since the fuel exchange of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ er Lov@@ el@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and is not recommended for the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ y including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medic@@ inal drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration concentration .
patients who use this drug may take effect at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be reduced to less effective ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ alli@@ zed inter@@ actions with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal counter@@ act can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the kind of inter@@ actions .
when Meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time , if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ine symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of a tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity , this formulation of tox@@ icity is con@@ forms to children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain patient groups .

in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe Immun@@ ity effect , a anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) could develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory response to as@@ y@@ mptom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections which leads to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial equ@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe Immun@@ e @-@ Mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ condition and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also substr@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so enzy@@ mes 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of a@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly exchanged for CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma bricks with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical verses and lead to a resistance development .
with an attempt to compens@@ ate the lowest plasma cutting through a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently un@@ wanted effects of the liver were observed .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) The serum levels of Am@@ b@@ ca@@ r can be ab@@ ased by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rant herbs ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated date ) .
if a patient has already passed Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the Am@@ b@@ lown mirrors are up and if possible to check the vir@@ al load and add the Johann@@ is@@ cab@@ bage .
a dose adjustment for one of the medic@@ inal product is not required when clo@@ ves is administered together with am@@ b@@ bon vi@@ r ( see also E@@ at er@@ enz below ) .
508 % increase , for C@@ max versus 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ b@@ lown caps ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and im@@ aging of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower if Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained during the combination of Am@@ us@@ o@@ r ( 600 mg of L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of pure u@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of pure avi@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can &apos;t be given , however , there will be a eng@@ ined monitoring , since the efficacy and health of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical study on the use of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the ant@@ a@@ ide component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gen@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore a dose of dose of 100 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is required for a combination of E@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with e@@ ag@@ ir@@ ation in combination with am@@ b@@ lown avi@@ r and string v@@ as@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both proteins would become low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other proteins and existing limited data can be avoided that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin might possibly sunk the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if this drug should be used simultaneously , be careful because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the cut and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma brick .
when this drug is used together , be careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be performed , as a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the simultaneous operation of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ d@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ dens@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fi@@ ut@@ in by 193 % and thereby an increase in adverse reactions .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ d@@ ut@@ in is to say to a reduction of the dosage of Ri@@ d@@ ut@@ in to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is necessary .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not carried out , however , the plasma emissions of both medicines might be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily dose of 700 mg of f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ ol once a day led to an increase of C@@ 69@@ mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ vis ) to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a daily use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below are listed below , including substr@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied to inter@@ actions together with A@@ gen@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored in toxic reactions that are connected to these medicines when they are used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other proteins , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase as it can come to res@@ or@@ tive disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ quities , known as an enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ mat@@ o@@ avi@@ r can lead to an ab@@ brevi@@ ation of the plasma bricks of Am@@ b@@ ca@@ r .
the serum levels of calcium block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ odi@@ pin , c@@ ann@@ ot@@ pin , ni@@ co pin , ni@@ co pin , ni@@ odi@@ ac , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 through Am@@ b@@ lown avi@@ r , reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this product .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ gen@@ ase can increase its plasma concentration considerably and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection @-@ side effects including h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ers , visual dysfunction and prim@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg of fluid defic@@ i@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days were significantly increased , while endo@@ genous e@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ conv@@ ene interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the potential benefit of a treatment that reduces the risk of systematic human cor@@ ti@@ ous effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depends heavily from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to be expected to increase plasma tor@@ ments at the same administration of A@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ a reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opath@@ y , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this product is not recommended .
it is recommended to increase monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as to stabil@@ ize the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used together with oral r@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while for the use of A@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ants indicate a possible increase in plasma tor@@ ques from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to the 3 @-@ 4 tor@@ rent .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with am@@ b@@ bon vi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ine symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ ability , no recommendation can be given , as the Am@@ b@@ lown up dose is given at the same time when Am@@ ad@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on .
for the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of an atten@@ u@@ ation or reinforcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal counter@@ act is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods to conception is recommended .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended for the benefit of A@@ gen@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after a careful removal of the possible user for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fo@@ et@@ us .

the health of A@@ gen@@ ase has been investigated in adults and children 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most of the patients connected with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , rising early and led rarely to treatment .
in many of these events do not clari@@ fy whether they are used in connection with A@@ gen@@ ase or another one at the same time for HIV @-@ treatment , or if they are a consequence of the under@@ age group .
most of these adverse events are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which proteins were not previously treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .

cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune effect , a anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) could develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory response to as@@ y@@ mptom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infection ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase had been observed twice daily ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) , an exception in patients receiving tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K values , who received A@@ gen@@ ase together with low @-@ si@@ sted R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dosage , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary .

the conclusions concerning the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation measurements can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to move the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data on the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .

each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain cross @-@ resistant against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to the din@@ avi@@ r , clo@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is generally kept in general .
there are currently data for the cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ j@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated patients ( one of them demonstrated a resistance against L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) and Tip@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 Isol@@ ate ) .
vice versa , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other proteins @-@ resistant isol@@ ate ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early demol@@ ition of a reconc@@ iled therapy is recommended to keep the accum@@ ulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in the limits that can affect the subsequent treatment .
the cover of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on A@@ men@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ y ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with the lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; b@@ oo@@ st@@ ert , &quot; received .
one hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to as@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis set the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change from the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ us@@ last ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ lower depression of 0.4 log@@ ged 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ affected A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ si@@ zed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of those with PI previously treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with A@@ gen@@ ase filed N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data should be considered as expected to be considered with PI pre@@ treated children who are expected to be considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ affected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ ca@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase , for C@@ max versus 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered together with am@@ b@@ lown avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ ca@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) remained un@@ influenced by the dietary intake , although the con@@ current dietary intake is affected the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows to close a large distribution volume and an imper@@ ative penetration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation in the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of the concentration of the concentration in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ b@@ lown am@@ ni@@ v@@ ae representing the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ affected Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients during the dosing intervals in the Ste@@ ady State Department on the C@@ max , s@@ s up to C@@ min , s@@ s .
it is therefore necessary to display the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induced or in@@ hib@@ its or a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be given to be given to be given at the same time with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ b@@ lown vi@@ r exposure as with an adult dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is made from a solution 14 % less bi@@ al available as of the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase solution and A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams basis .
even the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function would be low due to the elim@@ ination of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ es lead to Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r plasma screens similar to those who can get rid of healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily without a simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for the cans with am@@ ni@@ ons of mice and rats appeared in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ epat@@ ocy@@ cellular Aden@@ ome with doses of exposure to the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8- ( rat ) of exposure to humans , according to twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 @-@ based mechanism for the formation of h@@ epat@@ ocy@@ cellular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of this observed effect for humans is un@@ clear .
from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from therapeutic use , however , however , some notes for the assum@@ ption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ iz@@ tivity tests , the bacterial @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ sc@@ test of rats and chromosomes test in human peripheral ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tes included , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r was neither dirty nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical studies , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients were observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase , nor after the end of treatment .

in the study , mainly the safety of the medicine was examined , but it was also measured its effectiveness in relation to decre@@ asing the G@@ AG concentration in the ur@@ ine and relative to the size of the liver .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me gave the G@@ AG concentration in the ur@@ ine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdom@@ inal pain , arth@@ rop@@ ath@@ y ( joint pain ) , sp@@ inal pain , pain in li@@ mb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions at the infusion point .
very common adverse events in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen saturation ( a measuring type of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and cont@@ actor .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react rapidly ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will update every year all new information that may be known , testing and updating this summary required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards the reactions to infusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission distributed to G@@ enzyme Europe B.V. a approval for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human@@ eness α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ ier cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ pan@@ i , ov@@ aries of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ time enzyme treatment in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ ak@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ d ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase defic@@ iency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inher@@ ited met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries it all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop inf@@ usi@@ ble reactions that are defined as any alter@@ ations associated with the infusion or until the end of the infusion of infusion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored continuously , and the infusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done only in an appropriate clinical environment , where the rest@@ art@@ ing equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase form , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a inf@@ usi@@ oned reaction must be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
because little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , due to the theoretical risk reaction of a surplus @-@ reaction has to be careful after a inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of infusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ inated and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential failure un@@ conditional reactions .
in case of slight or medium @-@ severe infection , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ inated and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be used and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate when the response occurred .
in case of a single , severe infection @-@ related reaction , In@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ inated and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is weak@@ ened .
infusion rate can be resum@@ ed on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the response occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ c@@ ain because a potential risk of inter@@ fer@@ ment with intra@@ cellular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies do not leave to direct or indirect adverse impacts on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data of new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated against the breast milk on breast milk , is recommended to feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were classified as inf@@ usi@@ oned reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
un@@ wanted pharmac@@ ies in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respir@@ atory trac@@ ts and lungs in pre @-@ history , there were heavy reactions , including Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , breathing and visual fields ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ desirable medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who during a phase 2 study involving 20 patients at the age of 5 , are reported in the table with a majority of severe thic@@ ken@@ ess and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients came to a ser@@ op@@ version within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ op@@ o@@ version , with the patients at the age of 5 with a serious ver@@ tex form ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until an early retirement from the study ) were detected by Radio@@ immune response ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay proven antibodies before , among them 3 patients , where it never came to ser@@ op@@ o@@ version .
patients with lack of low @-@ physical levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ ke in Har@@ n , while patients with high antibody tit@@ res to determine an variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal effect to the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ gen@@ ic activity in vitro , which was not imp@@ acted the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of un@@ wanted pharmaceutical transactions , even if the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted pharmaceutical actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for the enzyme therapy is located in one for the Hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ sis of the accumulated substr@@ ate and preventing a further accum@@ ulation of re@@ juven@@ ating agents .
after intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase will be removed quickly from the cycle and of cells into ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ omes , most likely to the most likely about man@@ ag@@ osis @-@ 6 phosphate .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were randomised in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study on 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of patients had been recruited , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and just a patient showed the serious phenom@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had a for@@ c@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in 6 @-@ minute test test .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to placebo @-@ group improvement of lung function and the ability to see in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage of the percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant and absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ ilep@@ tic treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of cre@@ at@@ ine ) was determined that remained constant at the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between patients who summar@@ izes significant changes for five efficacy variable FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute test , it was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
an one @-@ year @-@ old Phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was investigated at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy @-@ cycle form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
in four patients , the dosage due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirrors increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ score for this age group . the younger patients with the mean follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form , whereas in the older patients with serious deteri@@ oration form might be limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into the dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schem@@ es were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can have problems with weekly inf@@ usi@@ ons , representing the difficulties with weekly inf@@ usi@@ ons , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ es is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will receive any new information that will evaluate annually , rate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the drugs features will be updated .

in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in had an average of 12,@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , patients , in which the cancer cell could not attack the plate epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta length@@ wise than with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission announced that Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. provides approval for the placing on the market of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
any flow bottle must be processed with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the flow bottle and can be diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in to the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as infusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ ry - In@@ fusion on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F was administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reaction must be given the day before and the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed @-@ gift as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ id is given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the dosage must be continued during the total treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ ry dose .
patients also need an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third act cycle .
in patients , the P@@ emet@@ re@@ ates received , should be created before each gift a complete blood pattern , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ment .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose of dose must be held in compliance with the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in Tab@@ les 1 , 2 and 3 that are treated for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mono@@ therap@@ ist or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
should patients be developing non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient must pay the value before the treatment .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ re@@ induc@@ tive tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued during the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 of neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies did not note that in patients at the age of 65 years , or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 , an increased by @-@ effective risk @-@ risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age because of non @-@ sufficient data to un@@ certainty and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustments necessary to go out using the recommended dose adjustments for all patients .
data in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ant values of &gt; compared to the 3.0 times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) was not especially studied in studies .
patients need to be monitored in relation to the Kno@@ - @-@ mark@@ er , and P@@ emet@@ re@@ ase may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil count again has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ at level has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil number and maximum hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as it was observed in the previous treatment cycles - the ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was deemed to have taken place when a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients with P@@ emet@@ ry treated patients are required to apply foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 than proph@@ y@@ - l@@ act@@ ate measure ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney suff@@ iciency ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ eic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction in therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , intended for the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , where these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid @-@ type collection , a dra@@ ining of the ergonom@@ ics of the ergonom@@ ics before the P@@ emet@@ ry treatment can be used .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ lics , when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life dim@@ ms ( except yellow fever , these vacc@@ ination is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shepherd - the re@@ productive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be taken in front of treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ ders , advice regarding the sperm count .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti @-@ oxid@@ ant ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ emet@@ re@@ ase @-@ de@@ position with the result of an increase in adverse reactions .
therefore , be careful when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid can be used in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction of therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding the interaction with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ value , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the sound status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires a increased surveillance frequency of the IN@@ R ( International normal@@ ization ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient &apos;s du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but how to be anti@@ met@@ ab@@ uses are expected in the pregnancy heavy birth defects .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , unless necessary and after a careful removal of the user for the mother and the risk for the f@@ öt@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of the re@@ productive capacity caused by P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment course , advice regarding the sperm count @-@ key .

the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ing extends from color@@ less to yellow or green yellow , without that the pros@@ thetic quality is imp@@ aired .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low cal@@ orie , fet@@ al nutrition .
patients who can take all@@ i and take no weight loss after 12 weeks , should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ies .
these enzy@@ mes are in@@ hib@@ ited , they can not build certain fats in food , which makes about a quarter of the food @-@ guided fats that happen to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , 391 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 was compared to placebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 of patients , the all@@ i 60 mg of patients had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .
the most common adverse events of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , Fl@@ atus ( winch ) with chair @-@ speed , chair pressure , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , slo@@ ping secre@@ tion ( wind ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be applied in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing the organ@@ ism with transplan@@ tation ) or with medication such as War@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients who are subjected to a long @-@ term mal@@ absor@@ ber syndrome ( which do not suffer enough nutrients from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( a liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission announced G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for placing the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ thet@@ ical , fet@@ ched diet .
all@@ i cannot be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there are not enough data for the effectiveness and safety .
since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ally , is at elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function not necessary to adapt the dosage .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other components • Excellent treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • temp@@ oral treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of raising gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or ob@@ ese diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes with a improved met@@ abolic control can take patients who consult a drug against diabetes before the onset of therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti @-@ diabet@@ ic has to be adjusted .
patients , all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or higher cholesterol , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ies if the dosage of this product must be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent the oral contra@@ di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on interaction of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a decrease of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma plasma .
during the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values could be affected ( internationally standardized surveys , IN@@ R ) ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene remained in the standard range .
however , the patients should be recommended to take a supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vit@@ amine intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on a limited number of volunteers , A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed in a limited number of volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect adverse impacts on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine , as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporary .
the Frequ@@ encies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data ) .
the pre@@ valence of words known that were determined after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is pl@@ au@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i to convert in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects can result .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight patients without significant clinical findings .
the majority of cases reported after the launch of cases of or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ do@@ ings have either been reported either side effects or similar effects as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on human beings and animal , it can be assumed from a quick re@@ formation of any system@@ ic effects that can be attributed to the li@@ que@@ fied properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect is set in the l@@ umen of stomach and the upper fertilizer by kov@@ al@@ ente Bin@@ der to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical trials was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food of food .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 mg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ or@@ ic , fet@@ ime diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been rated as follows : as a change of body weight in the study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg - 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
with the wa@@ ist circumference , the average modification was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .

overweight has influence on your health and increases the risk for the emergence of various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • premature cancer diseases • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis and talk with your doctor on your risk for these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more movement , the ab@@ norm@@ ality has severe diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to feed permanently healthy .
energy is also measured in kil@@ oj@@ oules , which you may also find the recommended cal@@ orie intake as many calories you should take maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal .
what amount is suitable for you to see the number of calories , which is suitable for you . • D@@ ining the effects of the capsule is decisive in compliance with the recommended amount of fat .
if you take the same amount of fat as so far , this means that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by compliance with the recommended amount of fat , you can reduce weight loss and reduce the probability of nutritional @-@ related companions . • You should try to gradually increase gradually and continuously .
34 But this reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight and continuously around 0,5 kg per week without fru@@ str@@ ations and dis@@ appoint@@ ments .
ever more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Straight physical activity &quot; means that you can burn daily 150 kcal daily , for example by moving daily 150 kcal , i.e. through 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 minutes garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to put realistic cal@@ ory and fat goals and to stop this also . • Use a nutrition diary with information about cal@@ ory and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more to move before you start with all@@ i .
the all@@ i program for supporting weight loss combined the capsules with a food plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to feed cal@@ orie and fet@@ al practices to nour@@ ish and directives , physically active .
in combination with a tail@@ ored program for the support of weight loss you can help you develop a heal@@ th@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is applied in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chemotherapy treatment , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ emet@@ ic ) .
the application of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since the effects in this age group are not enough information .
this means that the substance of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , prevents the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemical therapy , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the severe trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who have been treated with Alo@@ xi were no vom@@ iting ( 153 from 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission distributed to the company of Helsinki , Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , a approval for the placing of al@@ oes in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : on the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting on strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and vom@@ iting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding one before the previously given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
da Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron extend the col@@ o@@ dar@@ ling , we should be monitored by an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ lig@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful for the benefit of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is prolonged or those of such an extension .
in connection with a further chemical therapeu@@ tics @-@ free Alo@@ xi should not be used in the days following the chemotherapy , nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies of hem@@ o@@ os@@ et@@ ron the five investigated chemotherapy @-@ related activity ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady static concentration of the Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one of a population based on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist analysis it was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the cle@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience to use Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women unless it is necessary to be considered as necessary doctor .
clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly with Alo@@ xi were related to head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and observ@@ ations ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity actions and reactions at the appointment place ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar skins showed up to the other dosing groups such as in other dosing groups ; there were no dose of active relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective treatment in a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ or@@ ub@@ ic ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received an intraven@@ ous 1 without D@@ ept eth@@ ason intraven@@ ous .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 667 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who received 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron in patients that were given 1 intraven@@ ous day .
results of the studies with moderate @-@ based chemotherapy and the study combined with strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indications of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after studying clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron owns the ability to block the ability to block and to block the duration of the shareholder and to extend the duration of the action .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers carried out the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ a. in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ dens@@ ations a long elim@@ ination of the body with an average access half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are in general in the entire dose range from 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg when dos@@ ages and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured with 11 test@@ car@@ cin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
out of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic sim@@ ulations emerg@@ es that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached a total value of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ max after the entry was 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated across the kidneys , and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabolism that have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on Met@@ abol@@ ism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , which are involved in a less@@ er degree that are involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mcg / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in Ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous membrane injection , the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function , the terminal elim@@ ination free time and the average system@@ ic exposition with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , only after ex@@ positions were observed , which are considered adequate concerning the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies demonstrate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of is@@ on@@ ary channels , which can be involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ struc@@ tive De@@ er and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose has been given in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , an@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and as Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time use , the relev@@ ance of these results will be low as for men .

in June 2006 , the Committee on Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of approval for the placing of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C using Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ector solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon is an organic medicine called Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same conditions that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference variety &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hepatitis C ( one of vir@@ al inf@@ ection infection ) .
in case of a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue damage has been increased , and the values of the liver enzy@@ mes Al@@ an@@ in@@ - amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which the gene is associated with a gene ( DNA ) which stim@@ ulates this to the formation of the active .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon set up data that demonstrate the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of pharmac@@ euticals , effects , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared to 455 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 from a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus raised in the blood ) .

in addition , the concerns were expressed immediately , that data on the stability of the active components and the drug may not be mark@@ eted .
the number of patients with hepatitis C that spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A treatment was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon inflamm@@ ated the disease in more patients than in the reference point ; there was also Alph@@ eon had side effects .
apart from this , the study included in the study exam@@ ines the question to what extent that the medicine forms a immune response ( i.e. the body is antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) not suff@@ iciently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Imp@@ et@@ igo ( one with cruci@@ fix formation ) and small in@@ classified Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or or ker@@ ato@@ ) , se@@ di@@ ced and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections , det@@ ectable or presumably by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant forkli@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , because Alar@@ go may not work against this kind of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients with the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age may not be treated to treat skin surface more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment two to three days , the doctor should pro@@ ving the patient and draw alternative treatments in exc@@ essive treatments .
it works by block@@ ers of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
principal Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was withdrawn by the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 patients ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients were treated under placebo .
during the treatment of infected bon@@ ding eyes , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in were similar rates : if the results were taken together with both studies at skin wounds , about 90 % of both patients were treated to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of departure ( f@@ eit@@ ed cav@@ ity in the body tissue ) or of infections which have been proven or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a matur@@ ation at the order .
the conclusion of human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go during short @-@ time treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin inf@@ ectious amounts to the risks : • Imp@@ et@@ igo , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , se@@ di@@ ets or wires .
in May 2007 , the European Commission announced G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . an approval for placing on the market of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
the patients , which shows no improvement within two to three days , should not be examined once again and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a trans@@ si@@ zing or severe local Ir@@ rit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is broken carefully and an appropriate alternative solution of the infection began .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for the treatment of infections where M@@ RSA is known as a path@@ ogen or assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies of secondary infected wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections which caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in resist@@ ive forkli@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) was in@@ sufficient .
an alternative solution should be considered as a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to its low plasma concentration , which were achieved according to human application in human application , a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ing is not expected in vivo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral gift of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be placed on a poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure of patients , dose adjustments not required for patients when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin will not be applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown Re@@ productive hem@@ icity after oral intake and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the f@@ öt@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is to prevent the gift of a system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ otic .
in decision of whether the breast@@ feeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go is to be completed , is between the benefit of the breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections which Al@@ tar@@ go had applied , the most frequently reported side effects of Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the appointment place , which was about 1 % of the patients .
effects of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the effect mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction of a certain con@@ federation of the 50s under@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the bonds of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al of anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding agency ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L3 is involved in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the Pep@@ tide transferred centre .
by connecting to this binding , P@@ and@@ rom@@ util@@ ine block the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler units .
if the use of the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appear at least some inf@@ ectious forms , a coun@@ sel@@ ing should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insulation is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ respon@@ sive to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ enz@@ factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults was applied 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion and placed on scre@@ ened skin for up to 7 days .
from 516 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected wounds , single plasma tor@@ tures were won .
the sample was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of the Medi@@ ation and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording on humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % oint@@ ment on 200 cm2 cut skin ( 0 @-@ 24 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .

in studies of oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .

Am@@ bi@@ rix becomes the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between the ages of 15 and 15 , which are not yet immune to these two diseases .
Am@@ bi@@ rix is used in the framework of one of two doses of existing vacc@@ ines , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Am@@ bi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation consists of a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccine is due to be led out of two doses .
if a re@@ charging dose against hepatitis A or B is preferred , Am@@ bi@@ rix may be given or any other hepatitis C or -@@ B vaccine .
vacc@@ ines works by causing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can be against a disease .
after a child received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Am@@ bi@@ rix contains the same components such as the Twin@@ rix adults , approved since 1996 , and has been a approved vaccine for children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered during one of three doses of existing vacc@@ ines .
because Am@@ bi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a cover for the application of Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of a protected anti@@ physical concentration .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine is compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Am@@ bi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Am@@ bi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common adverse events of Am@@ bi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are binding , appet@@ ite , pain on injection , tube , ti@@ ghtness ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Am@@ bi@@ rix may not react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) to do not be applied .
in August 2002 , the European Commission announced G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ y@@ s.@@ a. a approval for the placing on the market of Am@@ bi@@ rix in the entire
the standard dim@@ mer plan for the Grun@@ dim@@ bi@@ isation with Am@@ bi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if the vacc@@ ination is required for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination of combination .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) antibodies are observed in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully secured whether immune competent individuals who need to have an Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , as they may also be protected by the immune memory by the immune memory .
3 As for all inj@@ ections of any an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine , corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring is always available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is necessary , the standard dim@@ pl@@ ema is recommended that the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface contains .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the immune system , any anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibody being achieved , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be required .
since a intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration may lead to an optimal im@@ pot@@ ence , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood disorders , Am@@ bi@@ rix cannot inj@@ ected as an exception in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration .
if Am@@ bi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ ic , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus c@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined m@@ um@@ - m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients under immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ defects must be assumed that possibly a sufficient immune response will be achieved .
in a clinical study containing 3 vaccine doses of this formulation , the frequency of pain , tubes , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ory , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever comparable with the incidence that was observed in former Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vaccine doses Am@@ bi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 imports from 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 , the toler@@ ability of Am@@ bi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination .
only exceptions , the higher Frequ@@ encies of pain and matches on a calculation basis per vaccine dose is Am@@ bi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Am@@ bi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses .
according to the complete vacc@@ ines reported 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects , the am@@ bi@@ rix had given , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % , were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ component material .
however , the incidence of mat@@ ory was comparable high ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects , the am@@ bi@@ rix was compared with 3@@ 6.2 % , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects , which received the 3 @-@ doses .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat was low and comparable , which was observed after administration of the combination with the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination .
in a comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old imports , the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actions and general contrac@@ tors were comparable with the 3 @-@ doses of combination with a 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant@@ ine hepatitis B surface .
however , in the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Am@@ bi@@ rix was a frequency of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the proportion of imports that reported over heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with am@@ bi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with a 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant@@ ine hepatitis B@@ - Surface an@@ tigen reported , was not statistically different .
in clinical trials that were conducted at imports of 1 @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the anti @-@ hardness rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS amounted to 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study , which was carried out in 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Am@@ bi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination of three doses .
in the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was imp@@ ec@@ tory , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with Am@@ bi@@ rix per month 2 and 6 .
immune response , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the im@@ fl@@ are received either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ inated with Am@@ bi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were at the time of Grun@@ dim@@ mun@@ eration between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies were detected over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Am@@ bi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination .
the immun@@ ode@@ ficiency reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant@@ ine hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transferred by vir@@ us@@ o@@ ing food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as through Baden through waste water pollution .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , a bl@@ ending face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that possibly need stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Am@@ bi@@ rix cannot protect Am@@ bi@@ rix with hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ines was completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vaccine doses Am@@ bi@@ rix already infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus ( although you do not feel free or ill / your child may not feel in@@ correctly or ill ) .
a protection against other infections which cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If you have an allergic reaction to Am@@ bi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by vibr@@ ating skin envelop@@ es , respir@@ ators or sw@@ elling of face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you have a severe infection with fever .
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the planned administration of the second vaccine dose ) .
with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will give you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Am@@ bi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine by a reduced content of an in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vacc@@ ination with reduced content of effective components is usually administered each month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination prior to the vacc@@ ination of vacc@@ ination .
sometimes Am@@ bi@@ rix is inj@@ ected , that suffer from heavy blood disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a condition or a treatment in your own &apos;s own def@@ ences , or if you submit your child to a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Am@@ bi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can &apos;t be enough , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the response to the vaccine is .
21 S@@ ing your doctor if you shall receive other medicines for other drugs ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without dis@@ sent@@ ing ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated with or if you have given / your child have been given or Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) , or that is planned in the near future .
but it may be that the immune response is not adequate for the vaccine is not enough and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Am@@ bi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as possible different li@@ mb@@ s .
if Am@@ bi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ inen , it is likely that the response to the vaccine is nevertheless sufficient .
normally , Am@@ bi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women is not administered , except it is ur@@ gently needed to treat both hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important Information about certain other components of Am@@ bi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you already have an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) once in your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk with your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

Am@@ bi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has become known since issu@@ ance of the first authorization for the placing on the market , CH@@ MP joined the value that the benefit of the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Am@@ bi@@ rix remains positive .
since Am@@ bi@@ rix was only put into circulation in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this product is limited due to its small patient exposition .
Ammon@@ ite may also be used in patients at the age of over one month with full @-@ full @-@ def@@ ective enzyme ( brain damage due to high am@@ mon@@ ary con@@ dens@@ ities ) in pre @-@ history .
Ammon@@ ite is divided - split by several single doses to meals - cooked , under the food , or via a gast@@ ro@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ ite ( through the stomach , leading the stomach ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( through the nose into the stomach @-@ leading tube ) .
it was no comparable study because Ammon@@ aps could not be compared with other treatment or placebo ( an inhibit@@ ing agent , i.e. without the active ingredient ) .
Ammon@@ ite may also result in App@@ et@@ ite loss , an abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ation , fluid problems or flav@@ our@@ ing , abdom@@ inal pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , un@@ acceptable body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that am@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle leads to high ammonia values .
am@@ mon@@ ks was approved in &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because of the rarity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this product .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients , with which a complete enzyme already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manip@@ ulated form ( in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ive enzyme , which is manifest after the first life of life ) , there is an indicator for use when the An@@ am@@ nese is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y .
for babies , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ u@@ ck@@ dysfunction is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is calculated individually in consideration of protein tolerance and the development of necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and with her@@ on growing and adults .
in patients suffering from an early emergency defic@@ iency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ s bam@@ yl@@ ase , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ y@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is necessary in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ syn@@ ase defic@@ iency need to receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with s@@ u@@ ck@@ dysfunction because a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets are not immediately available in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) of sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
in addition , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with cont@@ am@@ inated cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency with severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ formed and eco @-@ formation of clinical states only with caution .
da Met@@ abol@@ ism and de@@ position of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate of young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural pro@@ liferation and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there were also a delayed matur@@ ation of frag@@ ile syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve cells in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is di@@ vor@@ ced in mother &apos;s milk , and this is the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the n@@ urs@@ ing time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least an un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ wanted events , they were assumed that they were not with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ vic patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y , severe hypo@@ cal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old small child with a ver@@ itable single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate , which resulted in an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ sier of neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ian acet@@ ate is a met@@ ically active connection that can be con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine through the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is comparable phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both coupl@@ ings contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the de@@ position of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle may be assumed to be produced for each gram recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0,12 and 0,15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early release and the treatment is immediately begun to improve the survival and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early manip@@ ulating form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ar@@ ist , and the disease led in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their st@@ ick@@ ness free anal@@ ysts within the first lifetime of life .
due to Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of alternative means of nitrogen dioxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ) , protein reduced K@@ ost and possibly subst@@ itution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born diseases to 80 % within the first lifetime of life .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients , it was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logic defic@@ ien@@ cies .
in patients with a late @-@ manip@@ ulated form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ in@@ tran@@ s bam@@ yl@@ ase defic@@ iency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ oph@@ ilia and a protein reduced diet was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ ien@@ cies are almost ir@@ reversible and in some cases , a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical states may occur .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phenol , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mes , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine have been determined after a dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its Met@@ abol@@ ite was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
according to a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tra@@ ys form , 15 minutes were determined after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ cy@@ tom@@ y or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ id patients ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , the next morning were det@@ ectable , non @-@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate in plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , these were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral agent in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma cutting on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
de@@ position The medication is di@@ vor@@ ced within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine about the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests had sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses of rats no cl@@ ast@@ ical effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is used either for oral ( infants and children , who can &apos;t swal@@ low up any tablets , or patients with swal@@ u@@ als ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ ite or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and with her@@ on growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular , bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ protein should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early emergency defic@@ iency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ s bam@@ yl@@ ase , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ y@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is necessary in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active met@@ ro@@ omy of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , there came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of the Hir@@ n@@ r@@ inde .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ vic patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y , severe hypo@@ cal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is comparable phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both coupl@@ ings contain 2 nit@@ ric di@@ atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the de@@ position of over@@ lap
on the basis of research on the de@@ position of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle may be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0,12 and 0,15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ ien@@ cies are hardly reversible , and in some cases , a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical states may occur .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were determined 15 minutes after intake meas@@ ur@@ ions of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
for this purpose the small measuring spoon of 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient needs to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzy@@ mes , so that they can not ex@@ ag@@ ated the st@@ ick@@ ness of waste products that cannot be ex@@ ag@@ ated after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory studies , you will need to tell the doctor that you can affect AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ies if you have other medicines taken or recently taken , even if it is not pres@@ cription drugs .
during the n@@ urs@@ ing time , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug may go over to the breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , flav@@ ours , taste of body , disin@@ teg@@ ration , memory disorders , and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical states were observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , you immediately sit with your doctor or with the emergency relief of your hospital for the introduction of a corresponding treatment in connection .

An@@ gi@@ ox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood circulation to the heart ) , for example when un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in breast basket with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart rate ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous value for electro@@ cardi@@ ology or EC@@ G ) .
An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go one PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain the blood flow and the effectiveness of one PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , where the effect of angi@@ ox in all some gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) compared to conventional combination treatment with H@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI was compared .
while the PCI was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a sh@@ utter ) , and they received additional medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - for the prevention of new events ( deaths , cardiovascular cases , or revol@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year , as well as the conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ go a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as H@@ ep@@ arin , except for severe ble@@ eding , in which it was significantly more effective than H@@ ep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied in patients which may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other brain or one of the other components .
it should not be used in patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as people with strong hyper@@ tension or heavy kidney problems or a heart attack .
at the end , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for H@@ ep@@ arin , during one PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission distributed to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval of the placing of an@@ gi@@ ox throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ant@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ do ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) for an emergency turn handle or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ al of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if one PCI is carried out a PCI , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI clinical requirements , the inf@@ usi@@ ons dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a dosage of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial im@@ pover@@ ishment of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us @-@ gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) should be shortened to less than 225 seconds , should take a second stud of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of the chance , the re@@ constituted and diluted medic@@ inal product should be carefully mixed and administered quickly intraven@@ ously before the use .
as soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer necessary , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ al dose is 0.3 mg / kg , and the ACT is again tested for 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ al dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) that were included in the approval , the ACT ratio was 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment on average 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox con@@ forms ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be guided 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ fra@@ c@@ tured H@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular H@@ ep@@ arin .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ tension against active substance or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or increased blood disorders due to failure by hem@@ og@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ thel@@ ial cells . • serious kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are treated carefully during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding , particularly if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
even when using PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ .com , most blood cells occur in arter@@ ial points may occur in patients who perform a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment of principle occur everywhere .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the upper th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered as continuous operation with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to the control of Glu@@ cop@@ es@@ pi@@ g ( sugar ) in the blood or process the insulin delivery .
insulin @-@ insulin distingu@@ ishes itself very slightly from Human@@ ity , and the change means that it works faster and shorter operation time has a short @-@ term human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long@@ time insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and included in a study with 5@@ 72 children between the ages of four and 17 .
in type 2 diabetes , at which the insulin was not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the modification of the substance gly@@ ca@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which shows how good blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was diagnosed with insulin @-@ l@@ is@@ per after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0,@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,@@ 30 % of human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra can not be applied in patients which may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can act on the plat@@ ens tiles .
in September 2004 , the European Commission announced San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Germany GmbH to grant approval for the placing on the market of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdom@@ inal ceiling , apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdom@@ inal pain .
due to the cut Glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reducing insulin delivery , the insulin need to be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change of active strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ f , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or of the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin &apos;s requirement .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or demol@@ ition of a treatment , in particular in patients with ins@@ ulating diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabet@@ ic v@@ eto@@ azi@@ des ; these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of a patient on another insulin type or insulin @-@ insulin should take place under str@@ ingent supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the time of delay of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effect profile of the used insulin and can therefore change over the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that increase the blood sugar increase and increase the incline of hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , Dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ oxid@@ ant in @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ a , nit@@ iz@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ting temp@@ ers , cl@@ on@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reser@@ vo@@ irs the symptoms of ad@@ ore counter@@ parts are sh@@ out or missing .
animal experiments showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin delivery occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is res@@ orted according to oral application .
below are clinical trials known from clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organic classes and are often stated : ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; not known ( frequency on the basis of the available ba@@ - ren data ) .

Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy Will be continuously changing to switch the injection place within the injection area , can occur in the result of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy in the injection point .
heavy hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness can be given by means of in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Gl@@ ucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a doctor or an intraven@@ ous gift of gl@@ ucose .
after a gl@@ ucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ ine cause for severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating peripheral gl@@ ucose ( especially through sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the gl@@ ucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous G@@ a- be of insulin delivery occurs quickly and the duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ actus , insulin @-@ l@@ is@@ in in therapeutic doses range from 0,0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional reduction of glu@@ ed effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of the glu@@ ed effect as human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast active operation as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ ed effect of about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
data from the data was evident that at an application of insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a similar post@@ p@@ am@@ di@@ al glyc@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which will be given 30 minutes before meal .
is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was administered , a better post co@@ ag@@ ale control was given as a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal is required , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control like in human normal insulin , which is given 2 ten@@ ants before meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin @-@ insulin in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - previously ) before the beginning of a meal in comparison with human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) , as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin @-@ insulin in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of meal ( Figure 1C ) .
