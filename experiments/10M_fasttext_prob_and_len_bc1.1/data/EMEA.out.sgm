<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Service Report (EPAR) in which explains how the studies carried out on Human Resources (CHMP) carried out the study carried out in order to make recommendations concerning the application of medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package age (also part of the EPAR) or consult your doctor or pharmacies.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want more information regarding the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for inserting (1 mg / ml) and as injector solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Cres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), Missing and cheerical issues; • bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disorder in which the patient underwent serious episodes (periods of abnormal high mood).</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilisi is used for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes and prevention episodes of patients who have spoken in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for fast control of disturbance or behavioural problems when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution for adjusting or hot plates in patients can be applied to those of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who receive other medicines that use the same as Abilical, the dose should be adjusted from Abilisi.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotranitter," i.e., chemical substances which enable the communication of nerve cells among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably affects the receptors for the receptors for the neurotranitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonine).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole acts as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less than the neurotranitter, in order to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine is an important role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in addition to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or lack of symptoms and you will be repeating.</seg>
<seg id="14">Efficacy of Abilisi to prevent symptoms occur in three trials up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar illnesses that compared to a placebo over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilisi reported about twelve weeks of 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilical and placebo which had already been stabilized on 160 patients who had already been stabilized with aspects.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilisi injector solution was compared to a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder which compared to Lorazepam (another Antipsychotics) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the company also led studies to examine how the body's melting tablets and solution to influence is absorbed (takes up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution showed patients that received Abilisi in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms resulting unrest than those who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In use for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilisi was more effective than placebo in four of the five short-term studies of manbipolar symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilisi prevented for up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo which was previously treated with previously treated patients and when in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilisi injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms marked unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abili (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled), vomiting, nausea (nausea), breach, nausea (nausea), breach, nausea (nausea), nausea (nausea), nausea (nausea), sorption (nausea), sorption (nausea), swiss (sleep disturbed), insomuch (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">At the conclusion that the advantages of apologophrenia (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of chorophrenia and the prevention of a new manian episode in patients who had predominantly manageous episodes on the treatment with arias, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manicophrenia or in patients with manicophrenia or in patients with manicophrenia or in patients with manical episodes if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued the European Commission to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an approval for placing changes in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is the treatment of constant up to severe episodes of the bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new religious episode in patients who had predominantly manageous episodes and their lack of episodes on the treatment with arias (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although single patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapies or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the response to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicides behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affecting disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of antipsychotic therapy, also in treating with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased risk risk with Aripiprazole gave a comparison to other anti-psychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease, cervical sufficiency (dehydration, Hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure reducers) or hypertension (including aczeled and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spodyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional items about during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If using ABILIFY treated patients and symptoms of a late dyskinesia, should be considered to reduce the dose or reduce the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient concerns signs and symptoms developed to a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotica must be removed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used in patients with cramper in the Anamnese or at state-of-associations that are used with clamper in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with arias in patients with psychosis who have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with arias with arias, an elevated risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study involving fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted defivascular events in patients with arias treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases is extremely and associated with Ketoazides or hyperosmolarem coma, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents of patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagie, and weakness. patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in relation to a worsening of the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrens patients and in patients with bipolar Manie due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotica, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole the central nervous system is necessary, if Aripiprazole is in combination with alcohol or other centralized pharmaceutical products such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not relevant as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC from Aripiprazole to 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose-reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">For CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism can result in higher plasma concentration of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Arias compared to CYP2D6 compatible Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common administration of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should weigh potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protein inhibitors, would have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose-reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After deposed the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Dilemazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, with a constant increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of arias per day showed no significant effect on Metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3 methodology), 2C19 (Omepraki) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform her doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data of security in humans and due to the reproductive studies at the animal, this drug may not be applied in the pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is definitely the potential risk for the Fötus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other non-psychotica, the patients should be warned against service, including power vehicles, including power vehicles, to use until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below are defined in accordance with the following criteria: often (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Paraksonism, Akathering, Dystony and Dyskinesia compared to patients who were treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was under placebo in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with patients who were treated with arias and 15,1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>

<seg id="67">In another study about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% was reported in patients under Aripigezole treatment and 17,6% for those under a lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term development phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters found, no medically meaningful differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Arias treated patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To adverse events that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, donkey disease and crampraids, unwanted shredded vascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate overdosifications with Aripiprazole were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and observed without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hematylactic in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hematylactics has a high plasma integration in the treatment of an overdose.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of arias in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole revealed a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to Dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adore and to the Histamin-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripipraylbenzene in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dossier dependent on the bonds of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor co-Ligurine, at Nucleus caudatus and at the Putting.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 schizophrens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-phase controlled study, 52 of the proportion of patients who held a response to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprayl77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measured data were defined as secondary study data, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depresh scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was at 34% in the Aripigezole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an oslanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study at schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared with the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with more flexible dosage over 3 weeks of patients with a manical or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder showed a placebo over placebo over placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage of patients with a manical or mixed episode of bipolar-I failure to placebo had no superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled Monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manical or mixed episode of a bipolar-I interruption, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a higher effect compared to placebo which was comparable with lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also showed 12 comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Many on such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with a manical or mixed episode of a bipolar-I interrupt, with or without psychotic characteristics, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed a superior efficacy in the reduction of reduction in comparison to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase during a stabilization period before Randomisation had reached a remission in front of Randomisation, with regard to the prevention of a bipolar response, mainly when prevention of a bipolar response in the manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the elongation and hydroxyric of Aripiprazole which is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshal period is almost 75 hours for Aripiprazole at an extensive metabolism over CYP2D6 and at almost 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazole there is no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as at a pharmacokinetic examination schizophrens patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation for pharmacokinetics revealed no evidence on clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of the robotic to the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and dehydro-arias was similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different common liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to draw shots on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on the security spharmacology, toxicity at repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and to canoily potential, preclinical data do not recognize any special hazards for people.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they only have limited or no significance for the clinical use.</seg>

<seg id="98">However, in human beings at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the concentrations of sulfate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole were not found more than 6% of the concentrations that were found in the study about 39 weeks in the Galle of Monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after doses, which led to expositions of 3- and 11fold of the middle Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="645">One-one and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8, and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetical data that were recognised as dosisan independently.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma weight decreased rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Raschal biphase disappearance of the large cycle with half times t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) represent the fast resorption in the bones and the retention of the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the accumulated dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zoledronacid concentrations by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the turn (plasma concentration on time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance by Cytochrome P450 enzymes metallized substances is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized because it is not a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, nitrogen-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) demonstrated the renal cleance of Zoledronic acid correlated with the creatine cleance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatine cleance, and at the 64 examined patients in the mean age of 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">It yields that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function up to a creatine cleance down to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe kidney failure (creatine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data are not possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lettuous intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public. this document is a summary of the European Public Service Report (EPAR) in which explains how the studies carried out on Human Resources (CHMP) carried out the study carried out in order to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It is not shown in patients (especially overweight patients) in which Metformin (a diabetic medication) can not be applied. • It can be used together with other diabetic medicine.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to Metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), the metformin is not satisfactory in the highest tolerable dose alone.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphate resin or insulin can be maintained the previous dose of sulphide-fuels or insulin-insulin. in case of patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulphide resin or insulin is to be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the physical insulin can be used better and the blood sugar level drops, thus making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was examined; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphide resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood (glycaylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) which indicates how good blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which means that the blood sugar levels were lowered with the application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tribal therapy trial, the effect of an additional administration of acetone for existing treatment with metformin and a sulphur resin in a decrease of HbA1c values decreased by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients, patients who had an additional insulin showed a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in the context of Actos were visionaries, infections of the upper respiratory (cold), weight gain and hypothesesthesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients either against Pioglitazone or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic acid (high blood mirror - acidity level).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients, using Metformin in patients.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission announced the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing an account for the placing of cars in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the "15" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate, and in which metformations is inadequate due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age are not available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who endangered at least one risk factor (e.g. from previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a congestive heart failure, weight gain or furnaces, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a congestive heart failure, weight gain and furnaces are observed when Pioglitazone in combination with insulin is applied.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiac study Outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing unitary disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports about congestive heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range) or with other signs of a liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are increased, the liver values are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient developed symptoms that refer to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, torch problems, tiredness, appetite and / or darker Harn, are to check the liver data.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision on whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazone should be continued until the submission of the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, dosed weight gain has been detected, which can stir in fat-deposits, and is associated with a fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemophlution, under the therapy with Pioglitazone reduced the average reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies involving pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobin's disease by 3-4% and hematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-sensitivity, the Pioglitazone is treated as an oral branch or triple combination therapy with a sulphide-resin or as a dual combination therapy with insulin-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, under the treatment with thiazolidIndions, including Pioglitazone, over a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity was reported.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edemon if patients should report on interruption in visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmic information should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of Messages from randomised controlled trials, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients that were treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated questionnaire was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years treated with Pioglitazone women and 1.1 fractures for 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the Proactive study, a study about 3.5 years on the study of cardiovascular disease, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of a pregnancy or if a patient wishes a pregnancy or enter the treatment (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies in interaction of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenol and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contrast agents, Cyclosporin, calcium blocker and HMGCoA-reduction inhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with the fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of AUC of Pioglitazone around the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC of Pioglitazone at 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the treatment with pioglitazone reduces hypervisulinemia and increased insulin-resistant viruses and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the tower and refractive index of lens as they can also be observed with other hypoglycaemic active ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT-Anstents represented over three times the upper limit of the standard area often just as under Placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulfiylharnmaterial.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing macrovascular disease, the frequency of a severe congestive heart failure was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely more than cardiac insufficiency has been reported, however, if Pioglitazone in combination with insulin-sufficiency was applied in the Anamnese in combination with insulin-sufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was an summarizing analysis of unwanted events concerning bone marches from randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in patients treated with pioglitazone groups and over 7,400 patients in patients treated with comparative groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work on an activation of specific kernel receptor (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an increased insulin-sensitive skin of liver, fat and skeletal cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral Glucosity in case of insulin-resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as Monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be evaluated by Pioglitazone at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were randomly adjusted using insulin-sensitive optimisation, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared to the patients who still only received insulin-treatment in the Pioglitazone group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year, under Pioglitazon, there was a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / creatine quota in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapies with 45 mg versus Plazebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2-diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, placebo had a reduction of total plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels and a slight, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to Plazebo, there was no statistically significant increase of LDL cholesterol while under metformin and gliclazid reduced values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only increase triglyceride level, but also improved triglyceride level, this is also an effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the Proactive study, a kardiovasculous Outcome study, 52 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized in groups that were randomised to either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, Pioglitazone becomes fast resorable, whereby the peak concentration of Pioglitazone in plasma is usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenol and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive pioglitazone on humans the marker was found mainly in the scale (55%) and to a lower extent in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination life of unchangeable Pioglitazone amounts to people 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentration of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than in healthy volunteers with reduced kidney function, but the rates of oral cleance of the maternity is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys conform to repeated administration plasma enlargement with hemophlution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac trophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the treatment with Pioglitazone who reduces hyperancillinemia and increased insulin-resistant viruses and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of family omatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazolidons led to an increased frequency of colonies.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the "30" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated questionnaire was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years treated with Pioglitazone women and 1.1 fractures for 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Proactive study, a study about 3.5 years on the study of cardiovascular disease, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazone, there was a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / creatine quota in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride level, but also improved triglyceride level, this is an effect on the Tryglyzerid absorption as well as to the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing with regard to its primary endpoint, a combination of the total mortal, non-fatal coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronarer Revascularisation and Revascularisation of leg arteries, lay the results close to the intake of Pioglitazone no cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the "45" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of Messages from randomised controlled trials, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years, with more than 8,100 patients who received Pioglitazone, showed a increased incidence of bone marqueries in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the Proactive study, a study about 3.5 years on the study of cardiovascular disease, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>

<seg id="865">The study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycaylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) which indicates how good blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in HbA1c Spiegels that indicate that the blood glucose levels have been reduced similar to another human-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied in patients that might be sensitive (allergic) on human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">Moreover, the doses of Actraphane must be adjusted, if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar (the full list is to be found).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Human Medicines (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane was overweight in the treatment of diabetes compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission announced Novo Nordisk A / S approval for placing the placing of Actraphane into the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1401">Advagraf is administered adult patients receiving a kidney or liver transplant to prevent the transplanted organ through the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Since Tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft has already been deployed in the EU, the company submitted the results from previously carried out by prograf / prograft as well as data from the published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study was submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, whereby the application of Advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">Principal Indicator of efficacy was the number of patients where the transplantation was graded after a treatment duration of a year (considering such a renewed organ transplantation or a revival of dialysis needed).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, recent studies in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant were performed and examined, as in the case of prograf / prograft from the body.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Tremor (citrus), headache, nausea / vomiting, diarrhoea (hyperglycemia), diabetes, increased potassium content of blood (hyperliptic), hypertension (hypertension) as well as insomnia (Insomnia).</seg>
<seg id="1407">In patients with horizontal sensitivity (allergy) against Tacrolimus, macroid antibiotics (such as Erythromycin) or one of the other components may not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Patients and doctors must be careful if others (especially some vegetable) drugs can be taken at the same time with Cagraf, since the Advantaneous dose or the dose of the same time can be adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with the immune-intensive therapy and treatment of transplants patients should make this medication or make changes in the immune-intensive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft reactions or an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or overaging.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always be kept the same Tacrolimus formulation and maintain the corresponding daily dosage; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out in the transplant control of a medical transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a result of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus will remain.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based on clinical assessment of output and tolerability in individual cases and blood levels (see below "recommendations)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After changeover from Prograf to Advagraf the Tacrolimus Talks should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4 the systemic exposition was measured as a valley mirror, with both formulation and kidney transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspections of the Tacrolimus Talks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation, in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate reverse phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearing, can take a change of the Advocf-Dosisschemas several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">In case of the patients in the first post-operative phase does not allow medication treatment intravenous (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an infusion solution), the Tacrolimus treatment can be redirected with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of the application for suppression of transplantation must be reduced to immuno; it can therefore not be specified as a maximum duration of the oral therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplantation of graft reactions The oral Advoccipation Therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift on the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments can be necessary later, since the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of patients after transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft reactions The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day than once daily gift on the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage Recommended - Change from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted to a daily dosage of prograf capsules twice daily taking a daily dose of 1: 1 (mg: mg), in relation to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant After a changeover from other immunosressva to Advagraf once daily, treatment with the recommended initial initiation dose for the prophylation of transplantation can begin.</seg>
<seg id="1426">For adult patients who are converted to Advagraf, a oral Initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / kg daily can be taken once a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant patients although there are no clinical experience with lung cancer, pancrematory and darmes in a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, at pancreatic initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplants in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosisadjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood levels in the aspired area can be necessary in patients with heavy liver function dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it may be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum-increatine mirror, recommended for calculation of the creatine and a monitoring of the urinary volume).</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraf At the conversion of a Ciclosporin- based on a Tacrolimus-based therapy (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the bottom level in the blood level The dose should be based primarily on clinical evaluation of abnormalization and tolerability in single-line fro-Tacrolimus Talks controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to frequent controls of the Tacrolimus Talks during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during the maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talks from Tacrolimus should also change according to migration from Prograf to Advagraf, dosisadaptation, changes to the immune-intensive therapy or for the use of substances which could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentrations (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with low clearing, the dose may require several days until the Steady State entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">According to clinical studies, we conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the Talks should not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley of Tacrolimus lie in full blood in the first time after liver transplations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml, and with warm transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent development of liver, kidney disease and cardiac disease, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious events, including graft reactions or other side effects, which can occur in a row of Tacrolimus under- or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always be kept the same Tacrolimus formulation and maintain the corresponding daily dosage; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out in the transplant control of a medical transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft reactions, which proved to be proven compared to other immunosressva as therapy, there are currently no clinical data for the retardized formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For the prophylaxis of graft reactions to adult heart transplantation and Transplantation in childhood are currently no clinical data for the retardized formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to potential interactions which can lead to a downgrading of the Tacrolimus mirror in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of vegetable ingredients (hypericum perforation) contain, or other plant remedy during treatment with advanced notification (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations as the Tacrolimus blood mirror can be subjected to such circumstances on such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, aqueous humor or septumhypertrophy was observed in rare cases, which is therefore possible to occur even under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors which increase the risk of such clinical disruption, are already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticoeroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid overload and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosressva, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection by means of a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">When patients receiving Tacrolimus symptoms, symptoms of pres such as headaches, changing awareness of consciousness, forces and imaging, should be a radiological examination (e.g).</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf hard capsules, retina, lactose included, is patient with the rare hereditary gactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, lactase deficiency, or glucose-gactose malabsorption special attention.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or plant agents that are known as a inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can affect the metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus reducing blood values from Tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrolimus blood level when changing substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and to adjust the Tacrolimus dose to excessive concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interaction was made with Antimotica such as Ketoconazol, Fluconazol, Itraconazol and Voriconazol as well as with the Macroid antibiotic Erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies that the increase of blood mirror mainly derived from the increased oritinerary of Tacrolimus, caused by inhibiting the gastrointestinal replaceable changes.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-quality prednisolon or methylprednisolon, as it is used in acute remedy reactions, can increase the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor, therefore, the simultaneous use of Tacrolimus with pharmaceuticals, which are metabolized by CYP3A4, whose metabolism is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus put down the clearing of steroid-contradictiva and thus increase the hormone exposition, is especially careful to act with decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal try have shown that Tacrolimus would decrease the cleance of pentobarbital and phenazon and extending their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of investigations to transplant patients deliver no evidence that under Tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosressva an increased risk for unwanted events in terms of course and result of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborns to any possible harmful effects of Tacrolimus (especially as regards its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-virus-associated Nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multi-focal leukenie (PML) were reported in patients under immune disease therapy, including therapy with Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported over medium or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors in combination with the Tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high confluence to Erythrocytes and plasma rotein can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Effects of action and the codynamic effects on molecular plane leaves the effects of Tacrolimus by its liaison to a cytosolical protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enrichment of the connection in cell inner cells.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the use should be addressed afterwards if Advantate is used for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes bleeding problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method that is known as "recombinant DNA" technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell that has been introduced in the gene for the formation of the human being in the human being.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advantate is another registered product of the European Union called Recombinate, unlike, but it is produced differently, so the drugs do not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them one study with 53 children under six years, the application of medication was investigated for prevention of bleeding as well as in surgical techniques.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of Advance at the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood incinkers with "excellent" or with "good" rated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of advanced (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Schwinn, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advantate may not be applied to patients which may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against the human being factor VIII, mouse or Hamster protein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission distributed to the Company Baxter AG, approval for placing on the market in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage: dosage and duration of the substrate therapy is based on the severity of factor VIII-deficiency, after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">At the following hologorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma bricks (in% of the standard or i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., corresponding to the corresponding period).</seg>

<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours for patients under 6 years) repeat, until the danger is over by the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment course, a reasonable dose and frequency of injections indicate an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma bricks.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-Plasmaids are not achieved or if the blood is not covered with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out if necessary for a inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII-therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures will need to be used.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should be addressed according to the patient, whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising anti-antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always protected against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG Immunglobuline that are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk, inhibitors to develop, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is on the largest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposition-positioning and anamous-known inhibitor development, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII-product was observed, the recurrenation of (lowest titors) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare advancing of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs's largest number of patients showed inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) who have had a higher risk for formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very often (≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the available data cannot be estimated).</seg>

<seg id="1559">The blood circulation was discontinued during the whole time and the factor VIII- mirror in plasma as well as the Clearance Rate showed sufficient values at the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic moderate to moderate hemophilia A (≥ 150 days), only one patient showed a low inhibitor with ADVATE (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda base).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, no one of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and Diagnostics (≥ 50%) was determined by prior exposure to a factor of VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>

<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus, which genetically modified so changed that it can bear a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">With the virus in Cexin, it is a "Adenovirus," which was modified so there was no copies of itself, and that no infections can be redeemed by humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advecin would have injected directly into the Tumors and enable the cancer cells to form a normal p53-protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made of non-defectives in the human body is normally made from damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein is not correct but the cancer cells can grow forward and split.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company submitted data from a study involving a patient at the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of undermining, in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP, after the company had examined the questions on which submitted questions, there were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the testing of initially submitted documents, CHMP is created on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">After the CHMP view of the CHMP, the injection of Advecin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors has been benefits for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also concerns concerns relating to the processing of medicines in the body, the type of administration and safety of medication.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not sufficiently proven that Advecin can be made in reliable ways, and that it is neither for the environment even for people who are in contact with the patient.</seg>

<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharynological study, intake of Aerius and alcohol has not been strengthened the performance effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, the patients should however be clarified that in very rare cases, that can result in very rare cases, which can lead to an impairment of traffic or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical studies in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic uria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius when patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were reported more than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), mouthiness (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse events was treated with 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadine and 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, at which up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-times clinical dose) were administered, no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>

<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis can also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">According to the overall situation of the questionnaire to life quality at Rhino-economic tivitis, Aerius reduces the pollution caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic idiopathic urticaria was representative for other forms of Urtikaria, as the underlying Pathophysiology was similar to the etiology of different forms, and chronic patients can be prolonely prospective.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histaminant factor is expected to be a critical factor in all urarious diseases, desloratadine is also expected to improve the symptoms of Urtikaria in other forms of Urtikaria to an improvement of symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic uria, Aerius was effective in improvement of Pruritus and the amount of quaddling at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Like in other studies with antihistammatory of chronic idiopathic uria, the minority of the patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribed doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data are prevalent that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis in Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies should play the Anamnese, physical investigations and corresponding laboratory and skin investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolizes Desloratadin and find out a higher subject load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">Safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years of age, restricted to metabolic, is identical to the children that metabolizes normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medication contains saccharose and sorbitol; therefore patients with inherited problems of a fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose-absorptionshemary or a sucrose content insufficiency should not take this product.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were detected in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazol was administered additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharynological study, intake of Aerius tablets and alcohol does not amplified the performance effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total hardness of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic uria, were reported at the recommended dose 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, when patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, at which up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-times clinical dose) were administered, no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic uria and the profile of desloratadine are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the framework of a clinical study involving multiple outlets in adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dosage of up to 20 mg. a day applied for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharaological study of adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of clinical dose) was applied for ten days when adults was applied, no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents has no increased frequency of beats compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">During a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets conducted in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no impairment of the psychedelic.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies in adults, it was neither the simultaneous intake of alcohol either to a amplification of alcohol-induced performance deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets became effective in the lens of symptoms such as Niesen, Nasensecretion and itching of the nose, itching inflow and tube of eyes as well as juckering on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">According to the overall score of the questionnaire to life quality at Rhino-economic tivitis, Aerius tablets effectively assimilated by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic uria, Aerius was effective in improvement of Pruritus and the amount of quaddling at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restrict phenotyps was comparable with adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older men to protect the flu caused by the trunk (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine, which could cause a trunk of flu, which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A Grippepic epidemic breaks out when a new trunk of Grippevirus can be found slightly from human being, because people still don't have immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">Following administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the Grippevirus as "physical-foreign" and is antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later, in a contact with a flu virus of this family.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Then the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membranes of the membranes that detects the human body is abhorted) separated, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">In this way, the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient to comply with the requirements of the EMEA region to comply with the requirements of the EMEA region for prepanic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1903">If you want more information regarding the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years treated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), which are infected with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can not swallow the capsules, Agenase can be used as a solution, but they cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should only be classified if the doctor has checked the antiviral medicines of the patient previously taken, and the probability that the virus is talking to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between the ages of four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenase reduces HIV-quantity in the blood in combination with other antiviral medicines at low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not able to heal AIDS, however, the damage of the immune system and so that the development of AIDS linked infections and diseases can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase has been investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, which previously did not have been treated with proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This drug increased with low-sified Ritonavir reinforced Agenase in 206 adults, previously compared with other proteasants.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Principal Indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (Viruslast) or the change of viral load after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously taken no proteins after 48 weeks, more patients had one viral load below 400 copies / ml as under placebo, but Agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the viruslast, but with the children that had been treated with prototypic numbers, only very few were addressed to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, previously treated with protein numbers were treated with Ritonavir reinforced Agenase the Viruslast after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other proteasants:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteins of proteins, it came under Agenase together with Ritonavir to a stronger trash of the Viruslast after four weeks than in patients who continued their previous proteins:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of asgenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (blood paralysis), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash, and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be applied to patients which may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against Amjavior or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase may not be applied in patients, the Johanniskraut (a plant preparation for treatment of depression) or medicines that are just like asgenase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV, Agenase, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteoekrose (extinction of bone tissue) or a immune activitiate (symptoms of an infection that caused the restortive immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">At the end, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of asgenase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifiers of Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of asgenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously taken no proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally licensed under "extraordinary circumstances, as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission distributed to Glaxo Group Limited for placing the placing on the market of Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- inclassified, proteins and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually Agenase capsules are to be administered to pharmacokinetic boostered by Ambavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambcar should be used under consideration of the individual viral resistance samples and pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bio availability of Ambcar as a solution for inserting is 14% less than one capsule; therefore, Agenase capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligrams per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg Ambcar twice a day together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules are applied without the increased additive of Ritonavir (boosted), higher doses have to be applied to asgenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg Ambcar / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to be exceeded, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other proteins were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for the use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data to uncertainty and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose to Agenase capsules in adult patients with medium-serious liver function was reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver function (300 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be performed in patients with light or less liver function, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Iso enzymes 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>

<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests, clinically-phenotypical Cut-offs (cutting points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used for interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Ambavir associated genetic pattern creates a certain cross-resistant against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to the dinavir, clofinavir and Saquinavir is generally kept in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for the cross-resistant between Amjavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>

<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Ambavir retains its activity against some other proteins-resistant isolate; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early demolition of a reconciled therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in the limits that can affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The cover of the efficacy of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on Amenonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidy (standard of care, SOC) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with the lowest Ritonavir "boostert," received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to asgenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis set the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted average change from the output value (AAUCMB) in the Viruslast (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-lower depression of 0.4 logged 10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the effectiveness of unaffected Agenase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low-sized Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of those with PI previously treated patients had at least one (78%) or two (42%) together with Agenase filed NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included in the study included plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambcar is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, for Cmax versus 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered together with amblown avir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambcar with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amonavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained uninfluenced by the dietary intake, although the concurrent dietary intake is affected the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and allows to close a large distribution volume and an imperative penetration of Ambavir from the blood circulation in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the concentration of the concentration in plasma, whereby the amount of unblown amnivae representing the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unaffected Ambavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredients during the dosing intervals in the Steady State Department on the Cmax, ss up to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">It is therefore necessary to display the CYP3A4 induced or inhibits or a substrate of CYP3A4, be given to be given to be given at the same time with Agenase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Amblown vir exposure as with an adult dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is made from a solution 14% less bial available as of the capsules; therefore, Agenase solution and Agenase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrams basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Even the renal cleance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function would be low due to the elimination of Amonavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to Ambavir plasma screens similar to those who can get rid of healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Amonavir twice daily without a simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for the cans with amnions of mice and rats appeared in male animals benigne hepatocycellular Adenome with doses of exposure to the 2.0 times (mice) or 3.8- (rat) of exposure to humans, according to twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21-based mechanism for the formation of hepatocycellular Adenome and carcinoma was not yet clarified and the relevance of this observed effect for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies as well as from therapeutic use, however, however, some notes for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro Genotoxiztivity tests, the bacterial-lymphoma test, microsctest of rats and chromosomes test in human peripheral lymphocytes included, Ambelavir was neither dirty nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of the alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical studies, no significant liver toxicity in patients were observed, neither during the administration of Agenase, nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity at young who were treated from an age of 4 days showed both with the control and with amblown animals treated with a high mortality.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systematic plasma exposition, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage during people, however, a number of slight changes including Thymuselongation and minor skeleton changes were observed that indicate an delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenase capsules are applied without the increased additive of Ritonavir (boosted), higher doses have to be applied to asgenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg Ambcar / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to be exceeded, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be performed in patients with low or light liver function, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the medicine was examined, but it was also measured its effectiveness in relation to decreasing the GAG concentration in the urine and relative to the size of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme gave the GAG concentration in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, arthropathy (joint pain), spinal pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common adverse events in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring type of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and contactor.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not react rapidly (allergic) to Laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction), not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will update every year all new information that may be known, testing and updating this summary required.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observe Aldurazyme as regards the reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission distributed to Genzyme Europe B.V. a approval for the placing of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of humaneness α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammier cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Opani, ovaries of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-time enzyme treatment in patients with secured diagnosis of a Muakysaccharid (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place by a doctor, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries it all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme for adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusible reactions that are defined as any alterations associated with the infusion or until the end of the infusion of infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be monitored continuously, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should be done only in an appropriate clinical environment, where the restarting equipment for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG antibodies against laronidase form, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a infusioned reaction must be treated with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretical risk reaction of a surplus-reaction has to be careful after a interruption of treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2297">In case of slight or medium-severe infection, the treatment with antihistaminated and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be used and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate when the response occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infection-related reaction, Infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline, a treatment with antihistaminated and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen is weakened.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion rate can be resumed on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the response occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and Paracetcosteroids and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the previous response occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procain because a potential risk of interferment with intracellular intake of Laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not leave to direct or indirect adverse impacts on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data of newborns, which were exponated against the breast milk on breast milk, is recommended to feed during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were classified as infusioned reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted pharmacies in connection with Aldurazyme, who were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs in pre-history, there were heavy reactions, including Bronchospasmus, breathing and visual fields (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children undesirable medicines in connection with Aldurazyme, who during a phase 2 study involving 20 patients at the age of 5, are reported in the table with a majority of severe thickeness and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>

<seg id="2309">Most patients came to a seropversion within 3 months after the treatment of a seropoversion, with the patients at the age of 5 with a serious vertex form (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or until an early retirement from the study) were detected by Radioimmune response (RIP) Assay proven antibodies before, among them 3 patients, where it never came to seropoversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low-physical levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG spike in Harn, while patients with high antibody titres to determine an variable reduction of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal effect to the enzymatic largenic activity in vitro, which was not impacted the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted pharmaceutical transactions, even if the occurrence of unwanted pharmaceutical actions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for the enzyme therapy is located in one for the Hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and preventing a further accumulation of rejuvenating agents.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase will be removed quickly from the cycle and of cells into lymphocyomes, most likely to the most likely about managosis-6 phosphate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study on 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients had been recruited, the majority of patients from the middle phenotype and just a patient showed the serious phenomotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forcated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">Primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study where they received for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients compared to placebo-group improvement of lung function and the ability to see in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the percentage of the percentage of FEV is clinically significant and absolute lung volumes increased further proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepileptic treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of the GAG mirror in Harn (µg / mg of creatine) was determined that remained constant at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients who summarizes significant changes for five efficacy variable FEV, distance in 6-minute test, it was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">An one-year-old Phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was investigated at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with the heavy-cycle form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage due to increased GAG- mirrors increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-score for this age group. the younger patients with the mean follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form, whereas in the older patients with serious deterioration form might be limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>

<seg id="2522">During the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values could be affected (internationally standardized surveys, INR) (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta carotene remained in the standard range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patients should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamine intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">Based on a limited number of volunteers, Amiodarone was observed in a limited number of volunteers who received orlistat at the same time, a minor decrease of Amiodaron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect adverse impacts on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and hang together with the pharmacological effect of the medicine, as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The Frequencies are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1.000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the basis of the available data).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The prevalence of words known that were determined after the market launch of orlistat, is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli to convert in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects can result.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight patients without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The majority of cases reported after the launch of cases of orlistat-overdoings have either been reported either side effects or similar effects as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human beings and animal, it can be assumed from a quick reformation of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the liquefied properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is set in the lumen of stomach and the upper fertilizer by kovalente Binder to the active serin-rest of the gastric and pancreatic lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, the absorption of about 25% of the food of food.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 mg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day in combination with a hypocaloric, fetime diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the output value (at the time of Randomisation), has been rated as follows: as a change of body weight in the study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants, which have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their output weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (output value 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (output value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change of LDL cholesterol was 60 mg - 3.5% (output value 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (output value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">With the waist circumference, the average modification was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (output value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentration of non-metabolic orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral treatment of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, the therapeutic doses could not be metabated in plasma only sporadically and in extreme low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0,02 µmol) and without signs of a cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with adious patients, the minimal systemically stressed dose could be administered, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 according to the split of the N-Formyl-Leucine group), they were identified almost 42% of the total plasmacondensation.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied in chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (as Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapy treatment, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since the effects in this age group are not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as Serotonin), prevents the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemical therapy, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the severe triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who have been treated with Aloxi were no vomiting (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission distributed to the company of Helsinki, Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a approval for the placing of aloes in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: on the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting on strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and vomiting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be amplified by adding one before the previously given Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Da Palonosetron extend the colodarling, we should be monitored by anamnesty Obligation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, be careful for the benefit of pallonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT- interval is prolonged or those of such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In connection with a further chemical therapeutics-free Aloxi should not be used in the days following the chemotherapy, nor for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies of hemoosetron the five investigated chemotherapy-related activity (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose Palonosetron and a Steady static concentration of the Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one of a population based on pharmacokinetist analysis it was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, fluoxetine, Ritonavir, Ritonavir, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the cleance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience to use Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied for pregnant women unless it is necessary to be considered as necessary doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least possibly with Aloxi were related to headache (9%) and observations (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of oversensitivity actions and reactions at the appointment place (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar skins showed up to the other dosing groups such as in other dosing groups; there were no dose of active relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, however, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably not effective treatment in a Aloxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 mg / m2 of cyclophosphorubicin and 250 mg / m2 cyclophosphorubicin, ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 cyclophosphorubic (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours) received an intravenous 1 without Dept ethason intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms Palonosetron received patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron in patients that were given 1 intravenous day.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate-based chemotherapy and the study combined with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indications of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After studying clinical investigations, Palonosetron owns the ability to block the ability to block and to block the duration of the shareholder and to extend the duration of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers carried out the assessment of the ECG effects of i.a. in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows an initial decrease in Plasmacondensations a long elimination of the body with an average access half-time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are in general in the entire dose range from 0.3- 90 μ g / kg when dosages and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured with 11 testcarcinoma patients between day 1 and day 5 measured mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Out of pharmacokinetic simulations emerges that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached a total value of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax after the entry was 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated across the kidneys, and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolism that have compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on Metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, which are involved in a lesser degree that are involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in Urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous membrane injection, the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal cleance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function, the terminal elimination free time and the average systemic exposition with Palonosetron increases, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, only after expositions were observed, which are considered adequate concerning the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of pre-clinical studies demonstrate that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of isonary channels, which can be involved in the ventricular destructive Deer and Repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose has been given in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, annierenmark) and skin tumors in rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high doses and as Aloxi is intended for one-time use, the relevance of these results will be low as for men.</seg>

<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon inflammated the disease in more patients than in the reference point; there was also Alpheon had side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the study included in the study examines the question to what extent that the medicine forms a immune response (i.e. the body is antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (one with crucifix formation) and small inclassified Lazerations (Rissor or kerato), sediced and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections, detectable or presumably by methicillinresistant forklihylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo may not work against this kind of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients with the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age may not be treated to treat skin surface more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment two to three days, the doctor should proving the patient and draw alternative treatments in excessive treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blockers of the bacterial Ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Principal Indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was withdrawn by the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 patients (52.1%) of the 71 patients were treated under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">During the treatment of infected bonding eyes, Altargo and Cefalexin were similar rates: if the results were taken together with both studies at skin wounds, about 90% of both patients were treated to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo was found in the treatment of departure (feited cavity in the body tissue) or of infections which have been proven or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a maturation at the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The conclusion of human medicine (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo during short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infectious amounts to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, sediets or wires.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission announced Glaxo Group Ltd. an approval for placing on the market of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, which shows no improvement within two to three days, should not be examined once again and an alternative therapy can be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a transsizing or severe local Irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is broken carefully and an appropriate alternative solution of the infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for the treatment of infections where MRSA is known as a pathogen or assumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies of secondary infected wounds the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections which caused by a methicillin resistive forklihylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative solution should be considered as a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to its low plasma concentration, which were achieved according to human application in human application, a clinically relevant inhibiting is not expected in vivo (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral gift of 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazol increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin salbe placed on a poor skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure of patients, dose adjustments not required for patients when topical Retapamulin will not be applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown Reproductive hemicity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the fötale / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is to prevent the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In decision of whether the breastfeeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo is to be completed, is between the benefit of the breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections which Altargo had applied, the most frequently reported side effects of Irritation at the appointment place, which was about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effects of Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction of a certain confederation of the 50s underunit of the bacterial Ribosom, which differs from the bonds of other ribosomal of antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding agency ribosomal protein L3 is involved in the region of the ribosomal P-binding and the Peptide transferred centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By connecting to this binding, Pandromutiline block the peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomaler units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If the use of the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retapamulin appear at least some infectious forms, a counseling should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retinapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the insulation is sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-responsive to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulenzfactors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study involving healthy adults was applied 1% Retapamulin salbe daily under occlusion and placed on screened skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% Retapamulin salbe received twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary infected wounds, single plasma tortures were won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sample was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of the Mediation and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording on humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 cut skin (0-24 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative Metabolism of human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, among low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test and in the cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-micro-core-test chromosomaler effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither in male nor female rats with oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which reaches up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 cut in the skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxizable study of rats were determined for oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure), development-stoxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed Ottoman toxicity).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix becomes the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children between the ages of 15 and 15, which are not yet immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used in the framework of one of two doses of existing vaccines, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used when immunisation consists of a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccine is due to be led out of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a recharging dose against hepatitis A or B is preferred, Ambirix may be given or any other hepatitis C or -B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines works by causing the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can be against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the Twinrix adults, approved since 1996, and has been a approved vaccine for children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered during one of three doses of existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main Indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection of a protected antiphysical concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine is compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar in a six-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are binding, appetite, pain on injection, tube, tightness (tiredness) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react sensitively (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic) to do not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission announced GlaxoSmithKline Biologys.a. a approval for the placing on the market of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard dimmer plan for the Grundimbiisation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If the vaccination is required for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HbsAg) - and anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HbsAg) antibodies are observed in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully secured whether immune competent individuals who need to have an Hepatitis A- vaccination, as they may also be protected by the immune memory by the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injections of any anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccine, corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring is always available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standard dimplema is recommended that the 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface contains.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hematalysis patients and persons with disruptions of the immune system, any anti-HAV- and anti-HBS-antibody being achieved, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since a intradermal injection or intramuscular administration may lead to an optimal impotence, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Thrombozytopenia or blood disorders, Ambirix cannot injected as an exception in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphic, tetanus- and Haemophilus cenzae type b-vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined mum- mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients under immunosressive therapy or in patients with immundefects must be assumed that possibly a sufficient immune response will be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study containing 3 vaccine doses of this formulation, the frequency of pain, tubes, swelling, matory, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable with the incidence that was observed in former Thiomersal- and preservative vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 vaccine doses Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 imports from 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions, the higher Frequencies of pain and matches on a calculation basis per vaccine dose is Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3-doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccines reported 66.4% of the subjects, the ambirix had given, about pain, compared to 63.8%, were vaccinated with the 3-dose-component material.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the incidence of matory was comparable high (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects, the ambirix was compared with 36.2%, compared with 36.2% of the subjects, which received the 3-doses.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and mat was low and comparable, which was observed after administration of the combination with the 3-cans vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1-11-year-old imports, the occurrence of local reactions and general contractors were comparable with the 3-doses of combination with a 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinantine hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, in the 6- to 11- year old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix was a frequency of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of imports that reported over heavy side effects during the 2-cans vaccination with ambirix or during the 3-cans vaccination with a 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinantine hepatitis B- Surface antigen reported, was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were conducted at imports of 1-HAV 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The anti-hardness rates for anti-HBS amounted to 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study, which was carried out in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was impectory, the seroprotational rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than with Ambirix per month 2 and 6.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Immune response, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds a month after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the imflare received either a 2-cans vaccinated with Ambirix or a 3-cans vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were at the time of Grundimmuneration between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies were detected over at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunodeficiency reaction against both antigens was comparable to vaccination of 3 doses with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg recombinantine hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies are comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccema.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was administered in the second year of life with a combined seal, tetanus-, acellular Pertussi, inactivated Poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus in Röteln vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation of adults was shown for the present formulation of similar seroprotations and seropt rates as for former formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be investigated both before and after resuspenalties on any external partial particles and / or physikalisch visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has become known since issuance of the first authorization for the placing on the market, CHMP joined the value that the benefit of the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only put into circulation in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this product is limited due to its small patient exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonite may also be used in patients at the age of over one month with full-full-defective enzyme (brain damage due to high ammonary condensities) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonite is divided - split by several single doses to meals - cooked, under the food, or via a gastroomieschlite (through the stomach, leading the stomach) or a Nasensonde (through the nose into the stomach-leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was no comparable study because Ammonaps could not be compared with other treatment or placebo (an inhibiting agent, i.e. without the active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonite may also result in Appetite loss, an abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritation, fluid problems or flavouring, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, irritation, unacceptable body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Medicines (CHMP) came to the conclusion that amaps in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle leads to high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonks was approved in "extraordinary circumstances" because of the rarity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this product.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed in all patients, with which a complete enzyme already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>

<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early emergency deficiency of Carbamylphosphatsynase or Ornithintrans bamylase, the substitution of Cityline or arginine is necessary in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynase deficiency need to receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>

<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) of sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">In addition, AMMONAPS should therefore be used with contaminated cardiac insufficiency with severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium reformed and eco-formation of clinical states only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Da Metabolism and deposition of sodium phenylbutyrat over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contra-indicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous injection of phenylacate of young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neural proliferation and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There were also a delayed maturation of fragile synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve cells in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noted whether phenylacate is divorced in mother's milk, and this is the use of AMMONAPS during the nursing time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at 56% of patients at least an unwanted event (AE) and 78% of these unwanted events, they were assumed that they were not with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anovic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy, severe hypocalemia, panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred in a 5-month old small child with a veritable single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacacetate, which resulted in an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dossier of neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacian acetate is a metically active connection that can be conjugated by acetylacetate glutamine by acetylacetate glutamine through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometrically seen is comparable phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both couplings contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the deposition of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruptions of the urinary cycle may be assumed to be produced for each gram recorded sodium phenylbutyrat between 0,12 and 0,15 g Phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early release and the treatment is immediately begun to improve the survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manipulating form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infarist, and the disease led in treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their stickness free analysts within the first lifetime of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to Hemodialysis, the utilisation of alternative means of nitrogen dioxide (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacate), protein reduced Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn diseases to 80% within the first lifetime of life.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients, it was time with many mental disabilities or other neurologic deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manipulated form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygintrans bamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonophilia and a protein reduced diet was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficiencies are almost irreversible and in some cases, a further deterioration of neurological states may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenol, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymes, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine have been determined after a dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its Metabolite was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">According to a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in trays form, 15 minutes were determined after taking measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyccytomy or hemogloid patients (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), the next morning were detectable, non-phenylacate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, these were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral agent in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in plasma cutting on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>

<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests had sodium phenylbutyrat with toxic and non-toxic doses of rats no clastical effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is used either for oral (infants and children, who can't swallow up any tablets, or patients with swaluals) or via a gastroomieschlite or a Nasensonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and with heron growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular, branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serumprotein should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early emergency deficiency of Carbamylphosphatsynase or Ornithintrans bamylase, the substitution of Cityline or arginine is necessary in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacate (active metroomy of phenylbutyrat), there came to lesions in the pyramid of the Hirnrinde.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anovic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy, severe hypocalemia, panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>

<seg id="2858">On the basis of research on the deposition of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disruptions of the urinary cycle may be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phenylbutyrat between 0,12 and 0,15 g Phenylacetylglutamine can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficiencies are hardly reversible, and in some cases, a further deterioration of neurological states may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granulatform were determined 15 minutes after intake measurions of phenylbutyrat.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with "acute Koronarsyndroms" (ACS, reduced blood circulation to the heart), for example when unstable Angina (a form of pain in breast basket with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart rate) without "ST- Hebung" (an anomalous value for electrocardiology or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Angiox is applied to preventing blood clots in patients who undergo one PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with angina or heart failure to maintain the blood flow and the effectiveness of one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, where the effect of angiox in all some gift or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa-inhibitor (GPI) compared to conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was frequently used a stent (a short tube, which remains in the arteries to prevent a shutter), and they received additional medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - for the prevention of new events (deaths, cardiovascular cases, or revolascularisation) after 30 days or a year, as well as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI, Angiox was just as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied in patients which may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other brain or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It should not be used in patients who had recently had a blood pressure, as well as people with strong hypertension or heavy kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">At the end, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin, during one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission distributed to the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. approval of the placing of angiox throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute Koronary syndromes (instantile Angina / non-ST-Hebdo) (IA / NSTEMI)) for an emergency turn handle or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous Bolusal of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If one PCI is carried out a PCI, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI clinical requirements, the infusions dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a dosage of 0.5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial impoverishment of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a single Bolus-gift of Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">This value (ACT after 5 minutes) should be shortened to less than 225 seconds, should take a second stud of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of the chance, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed and administered quickly intravenously before the use.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer necessary, provided the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney disease (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether with bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second Bolusal dose is 0.3 mg / kg, and the ACT is again tested for 5 minutes after the second Bolusal dose.</seg>

<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a longtime insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and included in a study with 572 children between the ages of four and 17.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, at which the insulin was not effective, Apidra was investigated in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main Indicator for the effectiveness was the modification of the substance glycaylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which shows how good blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7,60% to 7.46%) was diagnosed with insulin-lisper after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the HbA1c concentration was 0,46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0,30% of human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra can not be applied in patients which may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisin or one of the other components, or in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be adjusted, if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can act on the platens tiles.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission announced Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH to grant approval for the placing on the market of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal ceiling, apply or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the cut Gluconeogenesis capacity and the reducing insulin delivery, the insulin need to be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of active strength, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinf, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or of the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin's requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or demolition of a treatment, in particular in patients with insulating diabetes, may lead to a hyperglycemia and diabetic vetoazides; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient on another insulin type or insulin-insulin should take place under stringent supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of delay of hypoglycaemia depends on the effect profile of the used insulin and can therefore change over the conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that increase the blood sugar increase and increase the incline of hypoglycemia (ACE) inhibitors, Disopyramide, fioxidant in-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxypha, nitizylate and Sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as Betting tempers, clonidine, Guanethidin and reservoirs the symptoms of adore counterparts are shout or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin delivery occurs in human breast milk, but in general, insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is resorted according to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are clinical trials known from clinical trials, grouped according to system organic classes and are often stated: ≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; not known (frequency on the basis of the available ba- ren data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-welding, cool and bluish skin, tiredness, nervousness or pmor, anxiety, irradiation, excessive Hun- ger, alteration of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will be continuously changing to switch the injection place within the injection area, can occur in the result of a lipodystrophy in the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglycemia with consciousness can be given by means of intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a doctor or an intravenous gift of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine cause for severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting the glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin delivery occurs quickly and the duration is shorter than at hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mactus, insulin-lisin in therapeutic doses range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional reduction of glued effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of the glued effect as human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast active operation as normal human insulin and achieves the full glued effect of about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Data from the data was evident that at an application of insulin-ulisin 2 minutes before meal a similar postpamdial glycemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which will be given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Isinglulisin 2 minutes before the meal was administered, a better post coagale control was given as a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Isinglulisin 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal is required, a comparable glycaemic control like in human normal insulin, which is given 2 tenants before meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin-insulin in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the beginning of a meal in comparison with human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A), as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-insulin in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
