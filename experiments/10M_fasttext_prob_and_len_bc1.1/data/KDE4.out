I d@@ are going to claim when you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you don &apos;t need &amp; digi@@ plug . if you don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ ous , then you don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ ous files to save very fast search and secure archi@@ ving to you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you need to make sure what your system is setup information structure in contrast to data structure . your image files must be stored on your computer . you need to save whether you want to save to your photos or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you need to switch to a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on the same place . if you &apos;re going to organize plenty of photos in one year . if you will have enough photos will then use folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then you will then use a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , working runs , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not be able to organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stack processing simple . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies the backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend you to save the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the installation page of the met@@ ad@@ ata into &amp; digi@@ plug . if you forgot that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written in the file , then you can then add the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database to the files by clicking the corresponding item .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change that ? to them &amp; digi@@ plug . them introduces a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now , the real work , since you should now choose any photo . of course you can select all the images that the same attri@@ bute need and then set the value . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos .
let us now learn with key@@ words , keywords , such as you are frequently called in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you are catal@@ og@@ ed images from another source with built @-@ in texts , then it will add the tree to the right place . the s@@ orting of the Hier@@ archy within the building is no problem and can simply be done by pressing a sub@@ tree to another . the changed pass@@ words are pursued by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while the under@@ trees are persecuted .
the graphics shows like different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very rough representation since each block consists of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are the characteristics of all images .
enough the key@@ words - the next section refers to labels or comments on the third important tool to catal@@ og@@ ise your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want to see most of your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , others photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are safe to interested in your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then catch some details to see people , the square .
and now I say to you this of the landing area of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . Wow ! it starts to dream , associations , the historical period is again present , you may perhaps even hear the silence . the label therefore has changed their perception of this panorama .
for other photos , the title may possibly be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you should show images you should tell a story , the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him to help you understand what you understand .
it is OK if a picture is not perfect if the strength has only work with a labelling for himself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ous , you can also save a lot of text , in an international@@ ised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , then you can tell you for a selection of images . if you want to export your images in Web galleries . you &apos;ll need to tell you the story of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . so you have to tell the story about the opening hours a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a bor@@ ing Planet in front of Google Earth ? good , because with images the train of the spatial presentation now runs with light speed .
the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already inn@@ um@@ bar and will be able to repeat yourself in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your journeys with geographical data . you can also download the photos at the shooting location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . you can also export Google Earth viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of cop@@ y@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also applicable in all changed versions , so also for the work of other .
the following description tells you what information in the setting page of &amp; digi@@ plug was taken ; as information shall be deposited :
author ( Syn@@ onym for Er@@ er and W@@ rit@@ er ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer . if it is not w@@ ished to protect the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . after that this value has been stored , it should not be changed anymore . this field does not support Com@@ mas as a part@@ akers .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( Syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . examples : this field contains the work drawing of the photographer . examples of this field can be as : employee photographer , freel@@ anc@@ er photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the authority of the author , this field has to be completed .
publisher ( Syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the An@@ bi@@ d@@ eter@@ feld to identify the picture . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here . if the image has a storage photo , then the group / Agency will offer the image here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against mis@@ use . everyone who has no protection against mis@@ use , or change it . the solution for this problem is digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug came ; is available in the near future a module for the stack@@ ing processing .
topics : record mistake , plate failure , EC@@ C , transfer errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ per@@ ation , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ ition
of course , we &apos;re not talking about CDs that have lost on the street or fire . these kind of losses are the same that you may also happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data restored company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data loss .
in order to combat the problem in CDs / DVDs , these must have been treated for you longer than a few years . of course you can claim hard CDs and DVDs to archive quality . there are offers of Gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . if you believe it lies in your exc@@ itement space .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can easily be readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good Dis@@ ks and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . it turns out therefore to choose the right .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to protect themselves . therefore they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for the form@@ att@@ ing and the control sum@@ s . despite this massive protective cover they are needed by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there &apos;s a convenient program named I@@ so@@ B@@ uster , it is running under Windows and Linux ; but is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications for damaged disks of damaged disks , hard disks , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to save the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that is spoken to CDs and DVDs was of course also applicable to the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good capture device to high quality media in a non @-@ quality media . if you want to check the media with a description , date &amp; author label and afterwards protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before using the latest hardware and software that can read this media .
floppy manufacturers reserve your statistics for itself . their manufacturer guarantee a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanism of hard drives : dis@@ mis@@ sal
in brief : disc@@ o hold on the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . for lower temperature applications , SM@@ ART can not notice this error . some of SM@@ ART introduced the immediate rec@@ ti@@ fication . these are particularly read@@ iness and re@@ location . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is just around the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also use data loss due to a current output before using the files , but these losses may normally produce without big problems .
while most electric devices does not comprise much , these can take severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ al@@ ies can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ al@@ ies can cause serious damage , hardware and other defects . protect themselves before the in@@ ev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money .
most widespread protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a part of the energy storage is absorbed and the rest er@@ det . however , it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , remember that not each plug @-@ in strip contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it provides the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protect the protection against fl@@ ashes and therefore the right connected devices .
since there is an over@@ voltage on your computer , you should consider that also all periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers represent over@@ voltage support which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for co@@ axial cable of cable modems and television card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for lap@@ tops and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus you are ideal for travelling .
while a over@@ voltage protection your system will protect your system before smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of unbe@@ ar@@ able data . it may be meaning@@ ful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ l@@ ash@@ ings , these devices can automatically deliver up to the power . some models allow you to run up until the electricity runs again . if you have a UPS , you should be sure that they are the same quality standards like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is suspended and compare his security against prevention of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you think it is good . at the end you should always remember any cable to tr@@ enne before going into the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as the backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer that you can store any quantities of data .
in comparison to the hard drives , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you have to send data on the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
solutions are therefore just as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is no general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution online . the professional variant provides you more in full resolution online . for $ 25 a year you will receive unlimited memory , which should be reviewed only in reality .
from sight of data backup the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically included with the TCP protocol automatically and with the large firms are included in the offer a backup and a partial memory . thus they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ful .
the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are an@@ due for transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one says when this occurred to you . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you should have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have no protection for it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data away than that in your computer .
in@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss because they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . these errors remains un@@ noticed .
even if you are not affected by transfers problems , you should look at the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available soon . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ inal file system . it is still in the Alpha status . it is still using the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % at the workplace systems . for not@@ ebooks , the proportion of th@@ iev@@ es is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the most common damage . it is currently limited to a lower damage as e.g. theft or re@@ installations . Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; there was no longer sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible for data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . a very good English articles will be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of pre @-@ examination during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the largest threat for digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes for data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stops of fundamental physical borders . this means that technology is further developed for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apix@@ els sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and a high @-@ quality look , the Optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 megapixel . for higher resolutions , you require a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or greater formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive will be able to use today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not require any data loss for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected in every year of any data loss . thus secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do something like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of records , or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you take your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will have you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget flight accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect an entire room or entire house .
hence Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ ce does not mean any local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighbouring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as above is already a common reason for a data loss despite backup the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without hist@@ ie and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete guarantee . generates a complete mom@@ entary snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the final differentiation .
incre@@ mental backup : one backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . this creates a number of mom@@ entary status to any time . this securing comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next one with the exception that it is only ab@@ get@@ ed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that allows you to easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file tran@@ scripts copied r@@ sync only the difference of files that really been changed . this happens and if you want to increase the security over ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after you stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
this approach makes you plenty of time to discover losses and restore . at the same time you will get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly rate recording for at least one month and a moment of mom@@ entary intake for every month . any further dil@@ ution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , storage , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ ev@@ ing images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visibility , ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable pictures can survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table everything is said to be un@@ predic@@ table during the period . unfortunately , there is no other way to date when the current system are back@@ wards compatible . the fewer variants you have in the past , the more lightweight is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is today available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay at open standards .
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . it is always increasing .
let &apos;s go out that you have plans to enlarge the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this section and put it to a new plate :
check the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t depend on it .
&amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC ( source is / dev / S@@ DC ) ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Size of the plate in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / cor@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create these self . this task is easier by year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format that van@@ ishes slowly from the market . therefore you should not use it anymore .
PNG was to replace as an open source standard , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can save gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ ity data for an improved color information , but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression data . this format we want to save you to store your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as an image format . it can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm . a problem is however , that this format has been adapted to many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licensed @-@ free and open source image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors in Canon and Nikon .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ forms ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is an overview of XML and R@@ DF . the file information will be associated with enlargement &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers draw it before a original recording , mostly in the raw format , as it saves the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file and how to notice the raw format is missing . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata initiative is an open organization that support a large area of application purposes and business models . among the activities of D@@ C@@ MI , work on an architecture and modelling , discussions and collab@@ orative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fying efforts to achieve an extended acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import pictures of the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera system , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your own archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for an enemy processing you can use external programs . if you get the pictures back with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut apart from the other programs .
protect the mach@@ ined images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , add in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section adding a photo to an album you can add a description as you can already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album bench .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , use this with the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it up . another description you will find in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . when the connection is made , a distance indicator will appear at the bottom and the int@@ ru@@ gs of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc on the camera will appear .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information on any entry . with the side panels and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of one entry or its met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer . note that for some digital cameras don &apos;t have all information available .
the rider Met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata like EX@@ IF , manufacturer , manufacturer , GPS etc . this information is the same as the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug . please note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer . download all photos from their camera to one record in &amp; digi@@ plug . when downloading photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to download the pictures from the camera before you want to delete photos from the camera .
if you want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , use the button to download and then selected box . download the selected button as long as you can choose some photos .
if your camera is supported , an option is available to download . these pictures were not available until now . in this case , the new pictures are available with a star in advance window . if you select this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you can download the buttons All Download or selected , a dialog appears to be taken into the photos below . the list of existing albums are sorted as normal folder , displayed in the section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after that you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug . loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete all of the camera by clicking the delete Del@@ ete . if you want to delete Del@@ ete , you must select this first and delete Del@@ ete .
please note that there is no way to restore the photos which you want to delete from the camera . if you want to clear whether the photos will be saved in a &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you want to delete all the photos into a &amp; digi@@ plug , if you want to delete all the camera than the camera , since this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not especially meaning@@ ful , after the photos taken from the camera . this may be meaning@@ ful if you upload photos of various recording types into the same album . therefore , it can be meaning@@ ful , the date and time , to integrate the image to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the picture and for date @-@ based substr@@ ates . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options While the transmission will open three additional options , which will be carried out before the photos stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use another file format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . switch on this option to read the help of the command @-@ time command .
if you are using the option of camera file names , you have the possibility to change the file names in lower@@ case . or in case letters , if you prefer this .
the new record , which &amp; digi@@ plug was used ; for a photo is used below the name , the camera is stored in the preview . its settings are stored and automatically used when you can open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ ous , you can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation during shut@@ ting . not all cameras represent these information . in the section side bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information which has embedded your camera in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and when your camera does not deliver this information , the photo in the original orientation . if you want the automatic turn off , use the kno@@ b and select the Automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
when your camera has been taken on the photo , where the photo was made available , it can be downloaded and digi@@ plug . all images with the same date are loaded automatically under the picture gallery . all the images with the same date will be downloaded in the same site . not all cameras make this information available . in the Section Side Bar Meta Data , you can read that information can be embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off and in this case you store &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to change this option , you will need to switch this option . use the button Extended and select the date based sub@@ tract at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their computer to the camera is button 1 . select the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; you can choose to select the file up@@ loaded . you can also select more than a file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug . you can where the pictures will be loaded up . a file selection dialog for the camera is released . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in length and lat@@ itude . the identification of data can be performed from the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photo photograph@@ ers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise ge@@ ographic place . not everyone uses a plane to insert a territory through automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten exactly the photo , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous , users can easily assign to the location of the photos so it &apos;s good to document the position data of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data in the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the data into this fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical mapping ( manual ) and last via the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera , which has a GPS unit . but there is a few that work together with GPS receivers . either as a map module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel . however , they must store these data in the GP@@ X format because this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data of images and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude grade or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the number of characters used to create m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle e.g. by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ous was tried to give you much control of its operations as possible . there are many settings that access the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ plug . set up on these settings , you need to change in eight pages . you can switch between these settings , click on the symbols of the left hand side .
action can select on entry @-@ up preview or start photo editing . set the standard behaviour of &amp; digi@@ plug ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard did@@ ac@@ ity and ur@@ gent data . these data will be selected automatically in the corresponding IP@@ TC data areas , when the option is synchron@@ ized to the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for author of the photographer : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be denom@@ inations such as described photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to indicate the photo . this must not be the author , if this has been registered for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , then the picture should be entered here . if the image has a storage photo , then the group or agency will be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this means that the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the image and not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug . these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ous ; imported without losing .
image read@@ ings as embedded labelling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos and you can also read from other images . attention : in pictures , who already contain gu@@ ill@@ ings , these are over@@ written by &amp; digi@@ plug .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .

you can return the default settings by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the fluorescent of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be opened on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have turned on this page . however , some pictures and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode is not available . if you have one , then you can only get on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch this here . you can switch the tool bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ exposed and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the photo processing this picture can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , the images in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance can be coded as in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the immediate explanation .
with the adjustment PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation reduces image quality , since PNG uses a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . meaning 1 : a low and 9 compression mode .
with the option TIFF files you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TIFF images . this decreases the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is free .
with the setting loss free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss free . even if you have written the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported but was in the planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ous , image processing is only a picture viewer for photos . currently , the image processing has been developed very quickly to a tool for manip@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of image processing .
the default increase is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option if you use this option to solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the picture a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ ing pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white button is used to use the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white @-@ off is not set . standard is a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors have the effect that exposed images in four steps more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is igno@@ red .
the standard is the top light , so the parts of your images are to catch the top white in the settings . using the attitude of your camera , it produces some unusual results since it shows the top lights in various ro@@ at@@ ches . last@@ ly , you can try to re@@ constru@@ ct some parts of the missing information from the s@@ lan@@ tern .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ constru@@ ct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each picture .
put the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . however , this may also be made later in the Image options of &amp; digi@@ ous ; this can be too small in order to keep the time for Dem@@ os@@ a@@ Val@@ ve , you should be able to proceed con@@ serv@@ atively .
a demo algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that provides many cameras and is known for a matrix @-@ coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ w ; and D@@ cra@@ w represent three alternatives to offer : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was used for me and that used by me . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was also interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as it is performed during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions such as these are given back . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; digi@@ plug . information like the colour information from a colour space in the other are as accurate as possible .
keyboard Beh@@ avi@@ or if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
colour profile folder S@@ insert here the folders such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ Color / ICC , where you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug . examined this folder then during the start .
settings of the ICC profiles , you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard supply ; to be paid for your profile . everything can be changed when opening the shell file later .
the colour management view is an alternative opposite X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ uments . here only your pictures are not managed by the entire screen .
the input profiles should adapt to the camera manufacturer and model that you can use . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have a color chart or Gam@@ ma@@ correction . this means that you don &apos;t need to carry the color mapping .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ pro@@ of @-@ profile , with which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer can be re@@ adily available , as your printer comes with a smaller color range as your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . this might be manually correct instead of leaving your printer .
for most of the cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , a table of cameras and profiles should be fit together here . this response is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion allows the style to recognize : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Neut@@ ral , P for portraits and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; picture lights and image processing is supported ; many modules support which have been written to support with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use and these are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ ous ; these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some in the context menu of the front .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ in .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ ed@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjustment the time between the imag@@ inations , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check@@ boxes switch the met@@ ad@@ ata or the screen ends at the bottom end of the images during the display .
the camera characteristics show on the left side a list of all the cameras supported . if you want to use a camera that is connected to the computer , switched on and in the image display mode , you have to make sure that the port settings are wired , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire Mass memory .
at the lower end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / bit , specify on which you hang on your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera to your computer and turn it into the display mode .
try out if &amp; digi@@ ous came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set Cam@@ am@@ od@@ ell and Port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu Cam@@ eras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the dialog dialog for the move of &gt; Pictures in tr@@ ash@@ s@@ ander , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ plug . in del@@ eting a photos in an album . in the sections of a photos and delete a album you will find further details .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down by &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you use the option to use in the right side bar without feedback . otherwise , you must use the changes with the button changes .
you can also use the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ plug . starting at start , this will accelerate the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ plug under circumstances .
the setting at the start of new photos are searching for new photos and search for the basis of new or deleted albums / photos . if something from the base folder was deleted , ask &amp; digi@@ ous , you know if it is to delete it from the database .
different colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous , to fit the main window to your taste . this settings can select below settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be recorded below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug , you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correction and improvement . the image processing can be started with a click with the left mouse button on a preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of details .
the photo processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug . there are therefore no part of your distribution . further information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section editing section .
a status line at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current record number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size shows .
a menu bar at the upper edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the processing functions of the photo editing change your photos . however , the original photo will change before you have used the original photo , before you can store the original photo not more , once you have saved the image .
you should therefore make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file saving as well .
as long as you don &apos;t have the photo , you can re @-@ produce the original image from the menu file re@@ produce , or the button The button re@@ produce in the tool@@ bar . you lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last Save .
almost any promotion of image processing can be re@@ produced or re@@ produced . the last action can be re@@ mod@@ eled by using processing , re@@ produced or restore processing from the menu .
if you often use this frequently , you should see the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to the reverse and to restore C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you choose the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the tool bar or restore button in the tool bar you can press a moment longer , you get a context menu . if you choose one of the menu entries , all the actions are made between also reverse or re@@ produced .
once you started the photo processing , you can move between photos in the same album or same key@@ word by using the navigation device in the tool@@ bar , picture height , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can walk in the photo and zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the check @-@ out menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen Saver displays the photo in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c button . if you don &apos;t want this , you can change this in the setup dialog of &amp; digi@@ plug . if you do not want this , you can call this from &amp; digi@@ plug . view the window to setup the image processing .
if you want to print the current image you can print in the menu file image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo here .
from the main menu allows you to print individual images or whole sentences . you must select only the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer . if you follow the assistant , you just need to make your choice .
the digi@@ plug came ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which is available for important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation plate , also available in image processing . it will be displayed if one of the five riders is cli@@ cked on :
multiple Click on the same rider , the side@@ bar leaves disappear and disappear again in the edge .
in the labelling view you can enter or insert the note down . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated and special characters are converted into other applications . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should notice these restrictions .
after you commented it , you can either use the button user or switch to the next picture that will then be saved .
in addition to the user button there is a button . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , this will always be done if you select a met@@ ad@@ ata setting that is always written into the pictures .
the section evalu@@ ates a valuation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sor@@ ter . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard ab@@ brevi@@ ation C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to rate several images simultaneously , select this and use the context menu .
the assessment will be written in the IP@@ TC field , which follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for fil@@ tering the key@@ words , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the previously shown in this &amp; digi@@ plug . session attached files .
the key@@ word tree is adapted to the entered search word . you can restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many key@@ words .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief during the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have different key@@ words , these are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords will be saved in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
when several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section .
the side@@ bar Key@@ word filters will be used to change the selection of the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - data , key@@ word and search options . if in addition one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the cut quantity of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and drain . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag them out of the right side bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears whether you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is reduced to no matter what the amount is reduced to three images . they were drawn up with C@@ tr@@ l + a and then put a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree to the selection and put it down there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word is to be set .
this search for changes takes place with any start of the program . it can also be switched on settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or to be , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control range .
( 1 ) : the entry , according to the database is sought . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can set a wide search of all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options are as follows :

this article / tutorial has been written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve got it mainly on &amp; digi@@ plug ; s specific implementation .
the reason why one is using a color@@ less workflow , you can reach the colors of your camera or sc@@ anned colours . using a colour@@ less workflow , you can reach the colors on your monitor using your camera or sc@@ anners , and select the colors that you will print or in the web from your digital dar@@ k@@ chamber .
if the theme comes on color management , then everyone wants to express what buttons must be available for the results . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you sufficient background information about color management . additionally , you should make your own inform@@ al decisions to make your own inform@@ al decisions to get the desired results .
if your image work@@ flows meets all six criteria listed below , you must not take care of colour management .
you can work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the RGB color space . ( more information see below )
your single other educational issues are per e @-@ mail or web , where the RGB @-@ fac@@ to standard is standard .
so if this RGB works well and makes life for all so easy , why should one use another colour space and make thoughts on color waste ?
a visual example of lim@@ iting from RGB compared to the colors we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ che region , and the colours in the RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB using some larger farms , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms page and then click on info and then click on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to get my monitor , if I have decided to work only in the RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you work in the RGB color space , or not , you need to work your monitor . if you work as a RGB &apos;s color space , then you need to use either a monitor on the RGB standard , you need to use either a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions to improve the image in most cases . use it as you try to try further manual editing .
the functions Normal@@ izing , same , automation and contrast expand from the menu correct Automatic correction , try to make the best of your colours . you will have to experiment with these effects to see what works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize the method : this method is sc@@ aled using the entire picture , so the dar@@ k@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
this method is adjusted to the lumin@@ ary of the colours of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity than as flat as possible . sometimes , the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes produces it only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles with a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjustable the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by one of the lowest and highest values of all values in between . this is only visible when balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; digi@@ plug was a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white comparison of a photos .
the white @-@ equal correction is slightly restricted to a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you &apos;re working too far from the original picture , if you can perform the white mode in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction are better .
this tool is based on a white algorithm of the copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it over the menu entry colors white in the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side are adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will be adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original box , then it is enough to click on the bottom window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els below this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above , a hist@@ ogram indicated that you will change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in good illuminated images , most pixel very small L@@ umin@@ ants . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , saturation and gamma . the shadow is adjustable , you can improve the shadow details of your photos or down .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the picture preview for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of white wine . on this type , the temperature and green values are automatically set automatically .
additionally , you can set the white comparison with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the surplus @-@ dict@@ ator increases the colours if more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is exposed . this will be shown the combined result in white wine . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and shop make exactly this . any adjustment of the white , you can use this in a text file and re@@ load later .
the button settings sets all the filter values back on their standard values and the corresponding neutral white wine . note that even neutral settings will be displayed as your original . if you want to save it , your original image will be changed .
you can set the coefficients of depth per color channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suitable for high quality images . this coding requires more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and stands only for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG formats .
this tool brings the same dialogue as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . a detailed guide for the use of paint pro@@ filing allows you to drag the chapter of color administration .
another important tool can be found in the menu under colours Ton@@ ight correction . this tool ensures that you can use several color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same error and you always need the same correction . in the manual , you can find further information .
a very powerful possibility of exposure to correct is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug tools ; tools Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ective provides you four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter available .
in times of chemical processing , solar energy , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , and afterwards the development of the image had been inver@@ ted . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted in the second lighting . this tool was a partial neg@@ atively of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar energy . at approx . 50 % intensity the image is chem@@ ically possible . another increase creates a neg@@ ativity that is not to create a negative image that is not possible to create a photo paper .
this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is ( 1 ) and that is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it distingu@@ ishes itself from a saturation that makes it a stronger contrast effect of the colours brilliant and smooth . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . this name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ as offers strong saturated colors for daylight and high contra@@ sts . however , Vel@@ vi@@ as offers strong saturated colors , but also some photo ograph@@ ers , especially those of which hardly under@@ take landscapes .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light to the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the repet@@ itions repet@@ itions the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ light . in large pictures , the filter can over@@ load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s not unusual that you want to correct the color console and the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu of colors . once you are satisfied with the result . once you are satisfied with the result , use the kno@@ k and you are used .
if you get a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the converted problem . also in this case , the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce s@@ saturation instead of it . if Him like the result , you can confirm your changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ starch / contrast / Gamma is the tool for the improvement of exposure to exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you will need to clari@@ fy the requirements of the slide . concrete is the three shooting below the hist@@ o program .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active edge as or the selected area . under the graph there are three sl@@ ur@@ ks to change and which can be moved in to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the control is to move the kno@@ b and consider how the picture changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box can be adjusted , whether the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis is widely used . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single pillar is dominated . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three kno@@ b : the top for the dark sounds , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for medium sounds , commonly called Gam@@ ma@@ ths .
the three color twe@@ ez@@ ers can be used in a preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the sh@@ adows , medium and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the choice of manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ bs that can be used in order to change the output values such as in the input rate . the compression of the output values can be used e.g. in the background while something else can be seen in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button the image values will be set automatically depending on the values of the image .
save and loading : these buttons can be stored in the file system and later re@@ loaded , which is used to use Gim@@ p levels format .
if you use this mode and the three color@@ ings , the input values will automatically be adjusted automatically for all sh@@ adows , medium and sun@@ shades . activate the original image to use the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blu@@ epr@@ ints and lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposed indicators controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , the half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically dependent on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side the following options are available :
modification of the channel : this selection box allows for the channel to be changed by the module :
in addition to this cheese , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will continue .
for example , if you move a cur@@ ator according to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones are correspon@@ dent and the corresponding pixels of the pixels are dar@@ ker .
the preview of the original photos is a red marking . if you want to change this marking on the area you will move , a right line on the curve is displayed , which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save and charging : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve you can generate this file system and later will be charged . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you create this method and the three colour paste buttons automatically create the control points of the curve , medium and sun@@ shades . activate the colour pi@@ p@@ ette you want and click the original picture to set the control points for the rotor , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
this option is controlled by over@@ exposed pixels , to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect on the final result and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below , you can see a black and white photo set in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ler . shadow and sun@@ shades was applied with the colour p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ plug . im@@ aging is a tool to improve the color@@ duc@@ ts or to change the color@@ ings of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colours channel mixer .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left section of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed as a comparison via the own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position these in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : kno@@ b for red , green and construction allow you to keep these channels even if you also activate the corresponding colour components . this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the color mixer for the generation of great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a colour is visible from the same place in color channel and their smo@@ kers can occur in each channel . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion , and then reduce the far@@ es first .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer setting can therefore store and then load . the file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposed indicators controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is re@@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . using the development of digital photography , black / white is a step step , because colour images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filters . this improved landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) or@@ ang@@ filter .
Rot@@ Filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic end effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar conversation towards the day time . similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : this creates warm bright and medium sounds during a little cold . this is very similar to the process of a print and recovery in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ scho@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug . the tool texture may apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting , a pop portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry image texture may be used for this .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter depends on the right increases the depth of the depth and three @-@ dimensional of texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect is applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed underneath ( 2 ) and the parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug , the tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is no easy task . a possibility of keeping its attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ ak eye . under the frame the module can be started under image processing .
type : with this parameter , you will set the desired frame type for your picture . pier@@ ce the picture with a thin line , ni@@ ep@@ ce leaves it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , it is ideal for a nice three @-@ dimensional frame and decor@@ atively add a decorative frame with pattern .
width : is the width of the frame in percent . the value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can add easily a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this will also be available in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set with its features such as you need . you will simply select the character set to the image size . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . it is the picture finished .
each setting you select for your text can be changed , until you hit the button &quot; OK . after the image has been stored once , the text is part of the picture . it can &apos;t be changed anymore .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug . tool templates can use a template on a picture .
the menu image sten@@ cil can be used in image processing to put templates via a picture .
for sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you must add the PNG file format and want to add with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) to illustr@@ ate the file size of template . if you will simply add an e @-@ mail in English to &amp; digi@@ plug . ma@@ iling list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for first time you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you will notice the template files . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root folder is set for sten@@ cils , a building view is displayed , which automatically reflects the folder structure of the template . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
below the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this button increases the below picture . it is cent@@ ered around the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inks : this button resi@@ zed the lower picture . if you want to apply template on the whole image , you need to reduce the picture according to the left mouse button . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template on your picture . the image will then be adjusted automatic .
&amp; digi@@ ous , three different tools are available for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of them has pre@@ ferences in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ cious images .
infin@@ ity mask works on the contrast of the edges to leave a picture sharp@@ ly . actually , it is not a bit , it works rather to remove the atmospheric Dun@@ st , and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by Win@@ ston Chang .
the focus is possibly the best of the three , because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its use and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ised pictures require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the resolution should be turned into a common color . the same phenomenon can be seen if colour points are printed on paper . SLR cameras require more toler@@ ated sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for the private user .
in JPEG pictures a camera &apos;s internal shar@@ pen@@ ing has been applied . in contrast , images in raw format must always be tigh@@ tened during processing .
some Scanner require a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already during the reading of the image . if you enable this de@@ activ@@ ating , you get the control of your picture .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing @-@ value . that allows you to correct calls with the menu entry .
you should now be careful because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . generally , you can correct your focus on the menu entry . in the focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution , the picture shows a bit soft , is much easier than it . use the tool to correct turn@@ out and experim@@ enting with the menu entry . the preview window on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp is a very good tool to remove sand@@ ing from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original picture and preview can help you process . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values generate very good results and should make first be tried . an increase in the radius or amount should increase the effect . if you create the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask will create room and create the impression of grass in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius produces as many pixels on each side of an edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow major radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen the best images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image one of the original is added , thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a break@@ age from the maximum RGB @-@ value and to apply differential amount . this means that a minimum difference is to be applied for an edge of the filters . in this way areas with a soft change between the killing of the shar@@ pen@@ ing , and therefore beauty treatments are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the resulting image has been applied ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ing was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous solution ; tools re@@ focused on a picture by improving the edge . it used the copyright protected outdoor filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool has tried an image about &amp; quot ; re@@ focused approach as merely try to try the photo . it is using a technique named F@@ IR Vienna fil@@ tering . re@@ focus is usually achieved better results than un@@ sharp . you can start making it from the menu by clicking colors re@@ focus in image processing .
in practice , the circular saw is much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the G@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse has a very long tail , which is far from the original pixel format , which is far influenced by the F@@ IR in most cases , even very strongly affected by the remote pixels . these causes un@@ desirable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most of the images the default value is 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp then however on Heiligen@@ stadt .
correlation : a correlation of correlation can help reduce art@@ e@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase of the room filter can help you reduce art@@ e@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still pollution .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . do not use this parameter if you do not use any un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ess filter . in most cases you should use this value to 0 , to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you need a value equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value specifies the size of transformation matrix . however , the size of the transformation size may be good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular edge or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . please note that the module is very slow if you choose a value for these parameters . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any editing parameters will be stored for later and then it can be loaded .
try all trimm@@ ing , colour and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before you use the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before changing the picture elsewhere . the reason for this is that much operations changes not immediately visible , but left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
when you read pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red produces better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ing a bigger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it needs to create un@@ sharp . even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ess . practically it is the result of the F@@ IR Vien@@ nese Fil@@ ters always at least as well as the sharp@@ ens mask . the F@@ IR Vien@@ nese filter is often better when processing small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different fil@@ tering , on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp colour screen has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ness in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regulator gl@@ are sets the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ess of the part of the dark , to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ ker allows a adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you like blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non @-@ selected arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as strong points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider and advanced settings .
detailed values &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . if greater values are mainly homogen@@ ous regions of smooth and more sharp . a value of 0.9 should be done so that no sharp@@ ness is necessary . please note that details should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated to in@@ depen@@ dency .
direction @-@ depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ ther evenly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie gra@@ ins or CCD @-@ noise , a high value of w@@ af@@ ers will produce a high value of w@@ ager . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts are best eliminated at a value nearby 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum torque factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . set this value to the degree of noise in your picture .
rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher value is set , the more will be sm@@ ooth@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : returns as often the algorithm is running . normally , 1 or 2 are enough .
&#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be small . make sure that small angle will generate a long runtime . thus , you should select this value as greatest possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel gl@@ and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more of quality you can get through the choice of this option is low . however , it doubles the runtime . we therefore recommend him out .
the buttons Save as and charging exactly this . any adjustment of image error correction can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast when working . however , it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below , you can see how picture error has been corrected with little art@@ e@@ facts . the module will be applied to a photo that is created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see it is an independent black Ar@@ te@@ facts in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad film storage during the travel . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; smoking production is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange . it uses a protected protected algorithm by Peter Stern .
this tool is available to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , can be removed too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ v ; effects of inj@@ ected images from books or magazines are to be removed .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this tutorial on English in this tutorial .
the screen photo above shows a typical scene that was done with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain noise that can be removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , only the sub@@ window details and the flush @-@ advanced settings can remain in the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time indicated by the filter per pixel and can be sm@@ ooth@@ ed on the picture and the color in it is sm@@ ooth@@ ed and thus smaller flaws were adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : checks the sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch to adjust the filter to the front . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image can &apos;t get rid of this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter picture details can &apos;t get more and noise or dirt again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can &apos;t be the entire noise , or cra@@ ck peaks . set it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controlled the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ ther process controlled by the details settings .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ ther process controlled by the details settings .
gamma : controlled the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically are stronger , however also cont@@ am@@ inated the shadow areas .
shock absorption : controlled the alignment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear to occur . if it is on its minimum , the noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove j@@ aws and is the recommended method for it .
save under and load : these buttons are exactly used . all parameters on the noise reduction which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how smo@@ ked your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes it is a picture to cris@@ p for your purpose . it is much easier than one image to shar@@ pen . use tool to correct turn@@ out and experim@@ enting with the menu entry . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ plug came ; photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photographs of photography .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts , film gra@@ ins , scrat@@ ches , scrat@@ ches , scrat@@ ches and local errors occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ ised images into image con@@ tours , making it the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ turing . the algorithm for restoration is developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ um and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a deser@@ ted compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; ar@@ e@@ facts ; - small standards that correct the un@@ compressed image . this setting should be correct to correct problems .
the buttons Save as and charging exactly this . any adjustment of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast when working . but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore stop the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
below , you can be restored as a photo with equ@@ il@@ ateral noise . the module is used on a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can recognize the not@@ orious film gra@@ ins on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures can be applied to an old color photograph , which have been used with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts and the photo gallery below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous tools ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel of photos which have been used with a CCD camera . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially with high quality raw mode photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression has a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ quot ; and . there is no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can discover the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the correct image . a automatic processing of the dark pixels will find the bad pixel . note that the assistant re@@ members the last dark image and re@@ load this automatically at the next session .
the picture area and the preview can help you correct the result . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all pre@@ text areas .
in order to see a def@@ ective pixels on a preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filter :
Dur@@ ation : it &apos;s an average of the neighboring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ectives pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block , to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ectives in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are moved to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ectives in block .
below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a def@@ ective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug . the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. , exposed corners , a picture to correct .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , you can often reduce the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( shaded ) they reduce the edges and edges of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor . tel@@ e@@ objective demonstrate this behaviour under circumstances .
but also dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle lens should also use with Center Filter , an aperture of f / 16 or less , otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen effects appear through movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ ming and shades sc@@ anners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of an Cent@@ er@@ filter by an equi@@ val@@ ents , the transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ filter is being applied to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping error correction , and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light damp@@ ing at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density amounts to 2.0 , or random a luminous intensity of 2 , ent@@ sp@@ ic@@ .@@ Increase the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ starch , contrast and gamma Settings : the editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the kno@@ b provide you only positive values , as you have to increase the settings .
if you want a more fine tuning of the exposure of the target image , then let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug . image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vis@@ itation in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a con@@ stri@@ de and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool .
the digi@@ plug came ; Lin@@ ear distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses to be correct . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool is working with geomet@@ ric distortion . colour distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second gradient is treated with the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can be correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third gra@@ b has a similar visual effect , but on the edges . this correction is not applied to the tool .
the coefficient of steps corrected the remote corners to the second gradient . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
in general , this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the second degree . with negative values , tonn@@ age can be corrected and positive values c@@ is@@ sen@@ ed distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion . this value will be stronger than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ ent@@ ils the &apos; corners parameter has the inver@@ ted signs of the parameter of General .
zoom : this value scal@@ ates the image size and performs a correction first gradient . negative values increase while positive on the picture .
brigh@@ ter : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image into the corners while positive values improve it .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the correction correction . the values are stored for your image , stored in the next start as standard values .
the tonn@@ age or magnitude @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . best perform this correction as all the first . if you have a picture re @-@ cut and thereafter a cord @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the wrong folder .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it into a important place , such as the marine edge or building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this site . in the connection , you can correct the tons of sal@@ ads with the help of the lines .
if you correct a k@@ is@@ sens@@ ed distortion is the resulting image of the black corners . you can remove this with the cutting tool in the menu . cut out of the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialogue .
for most of the pictures are the tons shaped correction . the next logical step for some designs , e.g. recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct the all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the fol@@ lic@@ ular correction to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infr@@ a @-@ infrared film the G@@ ather@@ gur@@ u website . filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left hand side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters for film screening and film sensitivity . if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ ft texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator has changed the amount of film gra@@ ins and the domin@@ ance of the colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filters of color channels to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color information are missing .
this is an example of infrared fil@@ let applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture below ( 2 ) and the image of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter movie isolation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ins on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the movies to increase the manufacturer great silver gra@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the movie isolation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get a tim@@ eless atmosphere from everyday life . if you like this special , Gallery @-@ such , street photographic , gra@@ ined sight specially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you have to use this filter .
with the kno@@ b , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grain . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , in ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ effects described on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected outdoor algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug . filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like a oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs around this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the pin size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better suited for big pictures . smoo@@ thing controls the glass or , from the other hand , the hin@@ ge .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and inten@@ s@@ gra@@ dients to generate a carbon@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . therefore , images whose gradient are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ating you . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two kno@@ bs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b cho@@ oses the pin size and the bottom tuning the contrast ( gluten ) .
this is an example of the charcoal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved further by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug . filter engraving shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a protected protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug . filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color does not use the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ a landscape .
the depth allows to set the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork with distortion effects . it uses the protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the picture in cells and can look like it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can stop this effects at any time with the kno@@ b button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work using un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects . it uses the protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ se : wi@@ ping the image along the circular lines going out by a central point . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ ale un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : do the image through rotation of the pixels around a center . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ess of a turning camera .
ran@@ ge@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ping the image to produce the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
movement un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : wi@@ ping the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera .
soft @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ping the image soft in the dark and strongly in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or add a warm and sub@@ tle inc@@ and@@ escent light .
cont@@ ing@@ ed the image by random shi@@ fting of pixels and sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ile camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ess : find the colour pool in the image and wi@@ pe them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the picture in rectangular cells and then created it by the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops onto your picture . this gives it a natural look of a clear appearance . it uses a be@@ ech se@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ he@@ e legally protected algorith@@ ms .
dri@@ pping size allows to change the size of the dri@@ ps . as the trop@@ ic size is not able to decrease the size for small pictures . number changes and density of drops . fishing changes the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can keep up with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; photo processing a range of free from rain@@ drops . use the tool set to select the range , e.g. a face that will remain free . if you start the filter shelf , the area will remain free of shelves .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the be@@ aded picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ations and trans@@ forming mirrors .
photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo on a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to resi@@ ght is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture ? how can you find a picture ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find a good job here . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a photo set the wrong size you can sc@@ aling it to the desired size with the size of the tool size . select the size of this menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is below .
the tool for the size is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to extract the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to bub@@ bles .
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ines Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug was developed . the underlying algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
you need to change the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and will be recorded below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original size is retained .
rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher value is set , the more will be sm@@ ooth@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as well as loading are used . each entry for photo can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo shooting is very fast when it makes , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
you can see below an example of photo shooting by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication .
the cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , press the mouse button and drag the rectangle , and you will see this rectangle with your mouse .
when you get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . this will get you a good overview of your photo according to the cutting area . you can also create a new rectangle with the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle can be opened by simply using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut @-@ cut button of the button button in the tool bar and the photo is tail@@ ored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save In the menu to save the newly created photo .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by move the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains in the dialog .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high format or landscape format . in the size of the size , the larger value of the height and in the trans@@ verse format is assigned .
the tool after aspect ratio is used . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you use cm , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to choose between horizontal or vertical .
below in the dialog , you can use the Max . relationship button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation , set .
the tool allows you to cut its settings on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as standard values in the orientation tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will be mir@@ ro@@ red and not the original image .
the settings of mer@@ ging aid allow it to help you to put your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ par@@ agus , harmon@@ ical triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ious triangles .
golden centre : the golden centre is a pitch prop@@ ag@@ itate on different natural growth models , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ ilus p@@ el or the ble@@ eding leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things which we feel as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the error number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to build the ancient Egyptians and Greeks . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i eps . 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two . the resulting divider is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden centre . a composition that this rule is considered a visual harmon@@ ic .
the golden centre provides li@@ que@@ fied relief lines if you put together a picture . these functions will be recorded at the bottom below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring your goal good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party par@@ agus , the golden spiral of the eye can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral , creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rectangle . it should be something that the eye is in the center of composition . that can be one line or different objects . this somewhat can be simply there without the eye , it will carry out his task .
the Golden triangles are also from the top @-@ discussed golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles does not include the equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object of dynamic object .
if you use gold triangles to stop your frame , you will create a effect of professional photograph@@ ers dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach differently .
the options Horizont@@ al and Ver@@ tical reflect can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the support lines can be invisible . on this type , you can custom@@ ize the color of your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where the things are turned around an angle . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; photo processing and the tool @-@ free rotation . select trans@@ forming Free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the slide angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the button settings , you can set the slide again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right .
for your help , the module is a horizontal and a vertical line available . move your mouse poin@@ ter to the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you shot an image you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an opportunity to repair it is the function trans@@ forming to use of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function of automation . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing gl@@ aze the picture a bit after the rotation . however , please note the above warning .
all per@@ spectral transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixation point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your picture . the preview will then be updated automatically . on the right side of the dialog box you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
the width of the new image shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective the image will be cont@@ am@@ inated . for individual adjustment , this effect is small but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after that you have changed the perspective , you get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one possibility to transfer this is the image with trans@@ forming cutting from the picture processing .
the tool tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part to the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted . with other words , a rectangle is converted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transformer .
tigh@@ ten your image by pressing the horizontal angles and vertical angles . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effectiveness will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right .
to help your help , a vertical and horizontal line are embedded . move your mouse to an important point such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to attach the lines to adjust your picture .
after that you have carried out the shooting , the picture becomes a bit ver@@ itable . for a single shooting , this effect is usually neg@@ le@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings produced twice as much rel@@ ational and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shooting , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is the picture with transformer cut out of the picture editing .
&amp; digi@@ ous came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore from your system and , in some cases , from the species such as these libraries are comp@@ il@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; shows only files in formats to know . this happens to the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension in the list is listed , &amp; digi@@ plug . you can change this list of file expansion en@@ closures and digi@@ plug . in the section configuration you will find further information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the same format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug supports both formats .
images compression is the application of data compression method to digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also be saved , if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the image format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions . in the section configuration you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; supports the shop of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ plug . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw form@@ ations which are supported by &amp; digi@@ plug .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in Avi@@ - or MPEG format . but if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to use a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use the program to play the program .

if you want to make the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four steps with the module white .
many tools which you need for drawing up are included in &amp; digi@@ ous ; included . their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ marks , cat@@ ching , un@@ sharp , un@@ sharp , etc . . use a uniform dialog box that is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; tex@@ tured quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison version of the pre@@ face area . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected pre@@ face range .
horizont@@ ally divided without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter used below the range below the selected pre@@ face range .
vertical . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the fore@@ seen and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which allows you to switch over and under@@ go exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general installation page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose a preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse inside the picture and want to see the part of the picture you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all setting from the last use of the module will be noticed .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information on the selected image and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Features : shows a summary of the most important parameters on the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive card search tool , based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ bus . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse pop button to draw a square . all pictures within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is of course that your pictures are included in the G@@ eo @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pall@@ ets and to choose and ren@@ aming colors are used .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case you are in your personal file for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , they can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to the color . the color is described under the pallet view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to choose a selection . in order to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse on the left mouse button .
if the check box Be@@ m cur@@ sor is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted either inserted or over@@ write a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode can be set by using the check@@ box over@@ write under the cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and insert .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a Z@@ eil@@ ing sign , if another color follows , can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit .
the colours in the pallet and output of color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a colour somewhere on the screen and then select the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ one ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical surface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ ite ; program program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph . displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ ite ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :

menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphy ; open to a &amp; Kate ;
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to present more than this no@@ des )
other required software : &amp; k@@ graph ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graph@@ s . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate sub@@ window . at the beginning , the main window is empty as in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool@@ bar can only open the symbol file and the ( empty ) list last added files . click on the first icon to view the dialog file .
after choosing one or more &amp; dot ; files have been selected , the main window will look like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , a summary displayed in the corner is displayed if the graph is bigger than the string area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position with the context menu .
use the mouse ( high and r@@ ots without special keys , left and right at the pressing &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
the zoom in both directions is limited by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the just changed in &amp; k@@ graph ; loaded file changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore change . if you want to change your decision . if you want to change your decision later , you can custom@@ ize your decision later , you can use the menu settings ... use , see also .
if you can open a graphic file outside a current &amp; k@@ graph ; file instance , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph ; instance , or want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph in a sub @-@ window of the already current instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change with the setup dialog .
when program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also set how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely elected .
if you use several sites , you can choose whether the parts of graph@@ s that will be placed on one side shall be igno@@ red on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph .

the site Er@@ ne@@ ut store gives you the possibility to set up a file on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore it ) or the program every time .
the site opening is the possibility to open the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph ; when a graph is opened outside of the current session . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( or in a new window ) or determine that every time is asked .
the site seating management gives the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph ; you can define a standard behavior ( the files on the last session or not ) , or determine where to be asked .
the context menu which usually appear in a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; select @-@ lay@@ outs . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graphics . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or historical represent@@ ations of judicial graphics . the algorithm lays down the edges into the same direction ( from top to right or from left to right ) and then tries to produce short edges and few can@@ ten@@ sions as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations in accordance with the diving spring model . thus , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm uses , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates an trampoline spring design layout . it uses the fru@@ str@@ man @-@ clean gold @-@ he@@ aders , and includes a multi @-@ grid , for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm uses the knots of circul@@ ating in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command as a parameter , and the calculated layout of the graphite after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . using such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; algorith@@ ms for special options , or even the graphics with a filter before it is drawn .
determined the type of graph@@ s ( set or prepared ) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ sealed graphics ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module allows you to add GPS coordinates into the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture to process and edit . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF key@@ word of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization tools are available to loc@@ alize images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , length and lat@@ itude .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS gauge as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download the data for you from your GPS device .
figure Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of selected images with a GPS trace .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . in order to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file contains , of course , data from the same time to the same places , as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded a automatic correlation was carried out the coordinates into red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore , the camera is converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set up your camera zone .
setting for the maximum time deviation is a lower deviation for the GPS time and camera time . the deviation below are the data collected . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have a track data from a place for pictures you can add the GP@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have any matching data . if you know that in reality a table difference between camera and GPS , you can set this bound@@ aries here and then press the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ arity .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialogue . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog box will use the coordinates from a call to the next notice , you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map according to and after which you will have . choose the appropriate region and enlarge it again through until you have reached a suff@@ iciently accuracy . the card must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang up the GPS data to the images . here &apos;s a small script that ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to add a stack of images with GPS data .
the picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 , to allow the best possible international@@ ization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to the settings . these albums are not allowed to select according to HTML . the albums are not shown here . with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area , the Al@@ ben@@ chmarks and the text is displayed in the head of the HTML page .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider can be created a gallery in each picture . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in the picture . otherwise the picture will be displayed directly with your standard view , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider &apos;s Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated pictures . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything will be created there .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a dip au .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module is using the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a base image file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ ash@@ au .
all pictures are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the slide . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are packed into MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that you can create the module via ex@@ tras MPEG slide .
the pictures are included in the portfolio below . there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . if you are using different formats , DVD , X@@ cd , SV@@ CD and VCD , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely to choose the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image process is specified below . a lower value is generated very sudden , a very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set as a next . in doubt you should set them black . in doubt the name and the path of the created file you can set up under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the extension mp@@ g at the same time .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after you can start your wishes , you can easily drink the generation of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can enjoy a coffee and enjoy the dam@@ sel if you are back again .
if a hint appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets on the right below .
the printing assist@@ ent allows you to print several pictures on a paper paper along in standard Phot@@ o@@ ons . these combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing g@@ p . this is useful to improve your printing or print the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your files stored in three format files in one of three formats to JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original size of Him is not expected that it is generated by d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results ! .
first , choose the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the R@@ aw &apos;s image Converter window appears then in the mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the white output . the essential parameters such as Gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can process the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrac@@ ting information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains equal and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss of algorithm and produced for the smallest file sizes .
the tagged Image format , TIFF , ret@@ ains all the information of your picture and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you pre @-@ edit your pictures often or later , you should not use the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose to JPEG as memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata are stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion . if you want to break this process , you can stop it off .
the stack@@ ing mode allows you to convert various images on one time . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single picture which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available to how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of one album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the starting number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the time .
this module can be used to change the size of several pictures of an image collection . it uses the transfer program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image or zoom it will be added to four types of image changes :
proportional ( 1 ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will be automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed to this option .
printing : preparing the picture for the photo pressure . the user can set the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the sent pictures before . further pictures can go on to the list of the left pictures and place there .
after you started the module , the pictures window with the selected images will be displayed . you can add additional pictures by clicking on the button . for the last selected image , a preview can be displayed on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and add it to the list of added images .
remove the selected images from the list of the selected images from the list .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message with button OK with the button OK . you need to add only the addresses and the subject . the selected images are added as app@@ endix .
make sure not to send many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of the e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send several mails when you want to send many pictures .
the email window will be used to change the settings for sending images . their configuration is stored and once again used until you change it .
choose your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google mail service , you need to install the GM@@ P Agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in an attached file the comments will be added to the images into a text file and added the mail .
the PNG format under the menu Images File Format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss free formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG to be changed and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend to JPEG format .
if you select to JPEG pictures file format and the original files are added to JPEG format , then the original exit data will be added to the connected images .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically and you can view the status messages looking for errors . their e @-@ mail program is started automatically at the end . with the button closure you can start this window s@@ lie ? EN .
after the starting modul@@ us of the Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window with questions as you want to see your slide show . you can choose between you selected and all the pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ Trans@@ itions option allows you to use very elegant image signals using Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the di@@ ash@@ ore will be very slow .
this option shows that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop means that the presentation is displayed in a final loop . you can then break manually with Es@@ c ; off .
the images are random@@ ly chosen to select the images in a random order . so it &apos;s not used the order of the pictures in the album .
under delay between the images , the temp@@ oral distance between the individual pictures may be set . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should select this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses another effect in any transition between the pictures .
during the Di@@ ash@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left screen area . move your mouse into this corner to switch off .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture to jump and stop the di@@ ash@@ au .
on the left screen , you can see the current file names , the position of the current picture and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested , please contact the ma@@ iling list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g . attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the current selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ men@@ u@@ s , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can see with &amp; delicious album ; by these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , there are now in each group , so in persons , places and in the group sample words .
in the browser window , you will see the categories where you have entered information as you have entered information and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition there are entries to view the folder on your hard drive and see the current preview images . in the following , each is described for itself .
when you push the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changed . see picture .
if you want to select another person only the pictures are displayed on which both persons are visible . by this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of the shown images of a few thousand pictures on a few single pictures .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view with preview images to view the images of your work area .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; delicious album ; however , for each person an own preview picture , this is also true for locations , keywords and other categories that you have defined itself . see also the picture .
to view images next to the names , select the button on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can select the view for each category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and simultaneously a list of key@@ words ( if you have no appropriate images ) .
you need to set itself , which should be displayed in the context menu for each individual person . now you will select the image for the corresponding person . in the check box window , you can custom@@ ize the image factor according to your wishes and thus choose which part of the image will be displayed and cut off .
when you call in the main window the entry will be displayed , the dialog box is displayed very similar to the dialog for making the image properties very similar . this dialog can be viewed on the picture at once .
if you enter a character sequence in the box type or description , the lab@@ s and descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use one section of two dates such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photos album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather than try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; col@@ oring album ; and look at the quick release , the screen photos and the introduc@@ tory videos .
launch &amp; delicious album ; and choose the first dialog for the demo , if you start &amp; delicious album ; for the first time , or choose the menu Help the menu entry ; -@@ Demo . then , some example images loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photos album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; kiss album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; col@@ oring album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this surro@@ gate you see here : . as the name suggests , this surro@@ unds you show your date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the time bar can display several different time units . each strip shows a different unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time bar can be inter@@ acting on the following ways : you can change the displayed message preview view from the database ( if you select a date , it will always show you the first picture of this date displayed in preview mode ) and also displays the current date of the currently shown images if you navigate to preview view .
you can also select a section of the time bar by clicking the mouse button and the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time values are displayed in the preview view only images of this period . you can choose the selection by clicking on a beam of the time bar .
you can create two options available to create HTML web pages with your pictures . one is integrated into your photo album ; integrated and the other than module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user book it is described in &amp; col@@ oring album ; integrated version described above the menu file HTML ...
before HTML pages , you will need to make some settings . these are split into the three areas of content , layout , and finish . in the following , any area will be discussed .
first enter the title of the ski@@ cks and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next you choose whether a &amp; col@@ ou@@ ched album ; export file is created , which is to be seen on the review page . you can find information about export files in .
at least , you can choose which information is displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is visible from a party . note that all pictures have been exported . currently , you can not use them to hide certain images from certain amount .
in this area you can set how the HTML pages should look like . most influ@@ encing possibilities are unique , which is why not yet made for these problems .
below the page you can set various resolutions for the pictures . by this way , those who have their website consider and have a monitor who supports maximum resolution 800x600 , no pictures will download the resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site allows you to change the dis@@ solution at any time . so he can find your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if it is a picture above , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setting range , place the various folders and the URL to where your site is stored .
best select a basic folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for every subsequent sentence .
first you need to select the main folder where all your pictures are stored . this folder is stored and automatically supplemented by the next time . here you can select either a folder or a file of K@@ DE supporting protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check this really all of the viewer . if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created , the URL you should be set here . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not able to copy them into the final destination folder , see , properly , you need to specify the final goal of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the standard setup possibilities have been drawn up all three to basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub @-@ folder created , whose name is set in the output folder .
if you &apos;re on a family party , a conference in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photos album ; you can now want to create your pictures with these images . if you &apos;re already too much time for viewing the pictures , recording location , etc . , you will need to do with &amp; delicious album ; this work doesn &apos;t have to do once again .
with &amp; delicious album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import and imported into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they distinguish themselves whether the pictures are stored in the file or if it is just a lin@@ king to the file , that you can put all pictures together into the file so that you can download all the pictures and this file so independent , however , the file size is .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either from the menu File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the pictures on two times . first , the pictures are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . these are not only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for export images are described , which can be purchased over the menu file ...
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to act with internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . you have the following three selection options available :
with the manual manu@@ ell into the vicinity of .@@ k@@ im @-@ file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
using the Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of .@@ k@@ im @-@ file copying &amp; photos album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . because most images have been compressed using JPEG file and the XML file itself is very small , it &apos;s usually not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , simply select the export file .
the last option of this page is limit maximum image size . if you want to send your friends images because the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you want to import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import@@ ing ... select , &amp; k@@ fully album ; the exported database is described as described in .
the assistant to import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to choose which images you want to import , then in which folders should be copied to import pictures .
it may be that you are called the Category persons on the imported file pers@@ onic ( if you are a d@@ ans ) , while this category is asked for your database . therefore , you will be imported into the third dialog window that are to be imported into the categories of the file to be imported into your database .
in the fourth step you can download the categories of your current database with the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the picture .
it must be simple to browse these images to browse and see : if you see images often , you would like to see images of your Italy vacation holiday and see a picture with your friend you want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown .
in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) to find out the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) searching and see up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ ting possibilities .
K@@ Phot@@ o@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been expanded and today &apos;s your videos . at many places in this hand@@ book it is spoken about pictures , but often , this also includes videos with one .
&amp; delicious album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top file of its pictures . this is an easy XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want to back .
&amp; delicious album ; re@@ members the folder where your pictures are stored and uses this with future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to read a different file in &amp; col@@ oring album ; with the -@@ c option , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
you can access the settings of your photo album ; you can access to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; col@@ oring album ; in the following section of the user book , you will be explained in the different setup possibilities .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can access the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which allows you to call through a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it has been described to you how you can set various features , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
on view the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . you can select a label and a symbol for each existing group .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options you can setup complete membership groups , e.g. all members of a group will be addressed once in a group instead of all groups of a central gli@@ der as explained in .
in case you can select the setup possibilities you can configure and configure the category . with the top selection list , you can select the category . in the left window side you can select a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ fully album ; announces his modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . you can find information on the homepage of K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; col@@ ou@@ ched album ; however , most modules have one help page that you can access via the modules .
since the modules of several applications can be used together , it can test that the modules are always tested with the demo database before you need to call on your own pictures - Demo _ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or about the menu Help . do not say , I wouldn &apos;t warned .
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; speed album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you divide functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; col@@ oring album ; and other applications that are also using K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums . even if &amp; col@@ ou@@ ched album ; this kind of order is not supported , it sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; speed album ;
sim@@ ulates &amp; col@@ ou@@ ched album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures you show you the picture gallery .
in addition to the current album and photos of the album ; the modules are also given a list of albums here . here you go with a photo album ; as follows :
when &amp; delicious album ; s browser shows the content of a category e.g. all the persons , then each entry will be a record for the module .
or it is the category that you have set up in the setup dialog as category for virtual albums , is used for example , if you want to use the category for example , so if you want to selected persons to view and to this module .
since some modules are equipped with &amp; photoelectric sensor ; you can remove this from the list of modules . start with the dialog dialog and select the modules which should be loaded to modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen once you start &amp; delicious album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , look at the top of the menu bar and a tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window where you have no more information about your pictures . in the section we &apos;ll see on this window , now click here to show you an overview with all available pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; col@@ oring album ; is the opportunity to see any picture with notes , where the picture has been added , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain remarks simultaneously . if for example on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all these remarks can be used for searching and browsers as you can read in the section . if you want to see this remarks if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text field by placing persons , places and key@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; col@@ oring album ; since you can always use it , when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is the move of the images within the list : if you are depicted in the example of a family party and shows the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can view that the names used are shifted upward , the individuals will find faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to display an ill@@ iter@@ ated list , click on the icon for s@@ orting to date under the list .
if you have selected comments on each picture , you may need to edit all the selected images and add these pictures with notes . click in this case simply click on the front and back buttons located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have several pictures , for example , with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to select all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries at a time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a group . to indicate that it is a special symbol will be displayed .
in context menu of the atten@@ tive dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry into a existing or new category . in addition , you can also move an entry to a category and place there to make this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you just iter@@ ate your categories alphabet@@ ically .
you can move the individual elements of the atten@@ tive dial@@ ogs by using the strip that make the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by connecting it outside of the window .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame too . if you want to download this window later , use the button options ... and then window will see a / fl@@ ashing . this process is shown in the picture .
if you select the record pictures in the browser , you will receive an overview with preview images of the current selected images , or all pictures if you don &apos;t have a filter . for example , you can configure the size of the look , by simply pulling the mouse using the middle mouse button , configure it just once .
if you leave an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be created as background picture for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the picture below . if you &apos;re not open a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the corresponding pictures from which you want to delete or delete either the remove button or choose from the menu pane . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
you can also have a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; delicious album ; namely images too , you can record the photos somewhere in the database . in the picture you can view the pictures of &amp; col@@ oring album ; if not all the required images from the hard disk can be loaded .
pictures , where the right above left corner is not stored on the hard disk . this is not available on the hard disk . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the preview images are available , so you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can view this pictures with the picture viewer .
as you see this feature you need to copy files from folders and copy it again . if you would like to avoid application of the appropriate CD , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the pictures you want .
in the menu Images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , you would like to see the pictures you want to see on the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also see all the pictures you can see your little sister , and choose everything except for current view .
with this you have set what pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to insert the laptop now your little sister , you simply select the menu entry into the menu . if you want to be locked , click on sperm .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered into a password . to set up this password , simply change password to your menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection could not be easily read or delete all images on the hard drive and to the others you can read or delete the password as an un@@ locked text or delete . this type of password protection can only be added to those who are with &amp; col@@ ou@@ ched album ; not very familiar with the view to private pictures .
the reason why you manage all your pictures with &amp; photos of you ; manage and learn about hours in order to describe it , of course you want to look at some time . from this reason , it features a picture _ and video viewing . you can preview it out of preview , as described in described .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the picture but you can enter the picture above the picture , e.g. who is on the image when and where was made , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can also configure this easily with the mouse and what information can be displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . this context menu can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see , matching entries to this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you are up@@ loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by clicking the buttons picture high and image below . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can be reached from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as Di@@ ash@@ au . once a new image can be loaded after a few seconds . how often a new image can be loaded by clicking the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or Min@@ us by keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer of &amp; delicious album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to change in full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer , you can move in the picture in and out . you can easily shoot a rectangle with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us key , you can zoom back in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be zo@@ om@@ t . with the equ@@ ine mouse sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel image of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with Plus@@ and Min@@ ust@@ aste are .
you can turn the image from the context menu . this does not work with videos . you can &apos;t work with videos . you can make note on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at images you can find a picture with a person whose name you will have forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can open the view and configuration dialog for the image to enter these names . however , it may be to select the picture to select and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on paper to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start with pictures and select it as good or bad , while you can view one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with traits , while you can view it . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letters . in view a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures you have in your browser . you can also see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you &apos;ve always selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you add categories in DR@@ E preview view , then you can add characteristics to the pictures by pressing the letters for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you can paint your photo album ; painting on the picture .
the painted is not stored with the picture but in the database . on the way you can turn your own later later .
you can see a picture on the painted picture . in order to switch the col@@ oring menu from the context menu . to stop the mixing menu from the context menu . simply select the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have to be read and understood .
in the tree tree you can select individual objects . then their properties in the object features are displayed and the object in the wire @-@ mod@@ ell@@ - views are displayed .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of a already selected object , since all accommodation is already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu entry .
if there are multiply possible positions , the subsequent shut@@ down menu will end , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under processing or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can choose selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on users to take these changes . have you inv@@ alid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then , you may report the input error messages and retri@@ eve the changes with you .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter your user documentation in setting dialog , you can call &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 provides the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the own view .
press the original texture view and a small example of the scene is selected with the chosen texture . as default , the whole texture is selected , even if you want to selected a sub@@ ordin@@ ate element ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross a locally .
screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can pull this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will be displayed a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visible level of view . you can specify this value relative to the visual level of the exc@@ essive value or as absolute value . objects will be displayed only if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the level of the visible level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object features are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like to use the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it as desired . you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different orders .
to draw a window over or below a view , then draw the beginner to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
to create a new column , enter the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views on each other , then draw the beginner to another view . you can then switch between the views on the card reader in the views above .
the last possible windows order are floating views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the ank@@ le , drag the beginnings on the desktop or click on the little arrow pointing left in the Anf@@ al Bar .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the Anf@@ al Bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can spot them at any point .
the current window view can store you with view window frames ... save it . it will be displayed a dialog where you can save the window assignment under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click the icon Ren@@ dering icon in the tool bar or select the menu entry .
an R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I files . he determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View Settings ... Select , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that can recognize the features of the mode .
in the card size you can choose the width and height of the desired image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box and enter the image section into the input fields .
in combination field quality , you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering , this is a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the rich characteristics can be found in the User Interface book &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only a beam per pixel , different errors can be created . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , sometimes more details will not appear when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technology called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . in general , pictures are better from this feature .
when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , it connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is still working again and adapted because the rec@@ u@@ sion@@ ing depth depends on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray controls a beam per pixel . if the difference between the values of pixels using super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is :
diff ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the values are divided , the pixels is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which will continue to be tested individually and set on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the records can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ ey@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use lighting refle@@ xion is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this card card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be comp@@ uted by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this .
to import an &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; Sc@@ ene , select the menu entry file import@@ ing ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete command line of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or warning messages , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support code text in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ ed and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can export objects from the tree tree into the editor to import the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source text in the editor . to import objects into the scene , select the source text in the editor and drag him to the object tree .
with copying and insert in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can also insert source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; too .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ dering . usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the help in the own image , click &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set here the path to your document and version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches for external files ( for example at alt@@ itudes ) to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you are not involved in the folders of the scene , you &apos;ll also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is specified in different paths of the library , the first folded file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type characteristics .
you can set the object of points on the grid in the context menu of the wireless model views . you can set the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and screen@@ ings .
larger values indicate a more precise wire model and thus a better sewing unit for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detailed stage for two directions .
if you cross the detailed proj@@ ections for advanced proj@@ ections , all wireless model views are sub@@ divided into the camera . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross it , there will be a bottom below the objects . the floor will be displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you want to activate edge detection , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be set . more details on the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the section window arrangements , you can create and save window arrangements .
the combination field standard window arrangement : shows all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used the chosen window rules at the start of the program .
the ts@@ un@@ ene window arrangements shows all existing window arrangements . you can add a new arrangement with the button adding and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
any window is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below name shows all views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can create and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ks the windows under the existing window , with cardboard box , you will not en@@ an@@ cho@@ red the view inside the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you can create simple scene in this guide , you should very popular among beginners : a ball on a level .
but you should consider the following war@@ nings , before using it compl@@ ain that you can only use a black screen when using a 3D program , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not adjust the camera , no rules can be applied for ren@@ dering , as a result , you will receive a black picture .
if you insert no sources of light , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get a black picture .
if you have all error installed , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation that you can expect an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , therefore , you should remember the menus and symbols , and they also realize their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide , you must first remove all objects from the property tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera is watching the whole scene which you generate . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows the result of the ren@@ dering of the scene .
the object tree contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click here , you will see the contents of the object features , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details .
do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , but note that you can change the camera in view control points , with which you can change the camera in the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag him to the desired place .
if you press the button on the button or the input button , change the wireless model views and the object baum immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could set a qu@@ ader ( insert body Qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a consistent method for the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; actually , a simple way . you can use an infinite level as floor :
a good Council : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button user or the input button . the new name is now displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the plain , if also at the moment only as a limited level . when you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane stretches out to horizon .
if you are looking at the property tree , you &apos;ll notice that you can see the entry for the ground . in this case you will find the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object features .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just making some of these parameters . choose shift and adjust the values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select a little bit out at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select as the object should be added . please select the name in the object tree . you can see the name in the object view ( name = floor @-@ pigment ) , with one click on the button preview , as the pigment now looks .
of course the preview of the pigments only shows a matt black material because you need to check the appearance of materials any time with one click on preview . now , you have the colors for the pigment . also there are many possibilities , but now take the easiest way .
if you do not see a color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is now correct . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course these are not the color@@ s. they are not expected . in the color list you need two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this entry twice ( you can also do this entry twice , but the chess board Far@@ ben@@ List can only be used with two colors ) :
select the colors every time and change the colors in the view of the object features :
this step should already be able to run , since you should have understood the basic work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be just as easy as the floor :
in view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the button in the bottom . otherwise , the ball was put on the ground , as you have shifted the soil to the bottom .
of course , the ren@@ dering results now a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . set in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the sphere , you can now have a material . as already at the bottom , enter the ball a pigment than paint :
choose Earth object and change the name for example in ball pigment . click on ball pigment , then select one color and set the values as follows :
but you can get more interesting effects when you take time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the user or press the input .
the settings of shine @-@ effect and reflection result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal is not selected yet :
you should now have a good impression that offers you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; we hope you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ wheel is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ er , the ren@@ dering of hypo@@ thet@@ ical sp@@ ells ( i.e. from the camera that reflected the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the rich effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects can be eff@@ ected as such as fog . so the scene pixels is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see without any camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously needs any scene that can be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you can open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
have you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . it &apos;s a new file , you need to enter a name and space .
the scene re@@ appeared in the last saved version . all changes since last storage have been rejected .
you can only select this menu only if you don &apos;t have any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last reverse order . this menu entry can only be selected , if you do editing the back@@ grounds .
stores the current window rules and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or order to write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , the keyboard zel and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard ab@@ brevi@@ ation . you can change or add this option for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; change commands or new .
opens a dialog for setting up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove with this option of tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; add commands and remove .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to allow rough surfaces without any hi@@ ves to be individually mod@@ eled , and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is usual to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will then be processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object colour on pixel @-@ base , by application of an image file as a color chart .
&amp; Stri@@ ke show ; is a comfortable video viewing and browser . the application has a file browser that allows you to select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ sk@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return Return .
you can adjust if any image will be displayed in one own window , or whether all images are always to use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the file window in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . when a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file is highlighted by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialogue Settings - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the work of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard zel can be specified for the respective window .
if this image is selected , then the pictures will be open in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with background color , which can be set below . default is not a full screen mode .
is this point enabled , invites &amp; harm ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option , &amp; ku@@ b show ; in the finish the name of the last open folder will be opening and will be opening ; this folder will be opening in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , this is also filled with the selected color here .
you can define &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen . this option is switched on .
note whether the sli@@ deshow can begin with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the change of a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions . if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow will be repeated until it is returned from the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the keyboard zel for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the maps of maps for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for sub @-@ folders and a window for the files ) and a partial view of the file system with folders and files in a window .

in the scope of exposure indicators , you can select the colour that will be displayed when the sub or over@@ exposed indicators should be selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you should display in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure to a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; entertainment photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view this side@@ bar in which you can view on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ ep@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not power more than pictures to scan and p@@ liers .
&amp; sk@@ ep@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan images that do not power more than pictures to scan and storing images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures before storing the files .
you can check the status of your scanner at the s@@ ane project page by default the information on this search side : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projected ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ ating ; with the command sk@@ ating -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can &apos;t be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop &amp; sk@@ ating ; finish .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ ep@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not expos@@ e these options .
in order to create an image , the user can launch a Vor@@ p@@ can and then scan the scanning range for the final scan . the preview can be launched by preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in the window .
when the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
when on the saving a preview can be selected in the settings , then the picture will be displayed in a preview window as shown below , then the picture is stored and lie down ? EN leads to a break and you will get back to the main window .
by button settings the ep@@ onymous dialogue is open before the main window . you can change the main settings here .
the user can look at the picture if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type of &amp; sk@@ ep@@ ite ; pictures stores to select the dialog for any picture opening the dialog before each of the c@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ ep@@ ite ; it automatically needs to save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to save saving without a file name .
this setting defines where the pictures are stored in the Save without after a file names , then the images will be stored as a standard for the Save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the image to save images and is also the proposed name for the image to save . the automatically stored picture gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality to store image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .

you can also configure your existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; am@@ arok ; add short commands . thereby you make your keyboard to &amp; am@@ arok ; Control Centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly seen in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ playlist , player , playlist , playlist and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP @-@ function break could look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok also has some of their own command line options .
you should have a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script , whether all the required modules are available , and use the dialog that the user does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is , for this script . &apos; the dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; .
in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of presentation scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or simply use them to extend the required functions . you will quickly determine that the writing process is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be compens@@ ated every K@@ DE installation .
most script languages allow out@@ going out of external programs and commands . additionally , the function ex@@ ec ( ) uses d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends al@@ ert noti@@ fications to all current scripts . using this reason , scripts are to monitor their default settings and react to events . of course , a script may also ignore the events even though it has no use .
configure the script to view the setup dialog . to save and loading the setup data must take care of any script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alized that a new piece is played . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the product length ) .
volume change new@@ .@@ Volume signal to the volume of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ary Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : Sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ bers - Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files of playlist , so you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ el@@ ep@@ ilep@@ script add@@ tion Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title ) , so you can remove the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title ) to remove a record again , you can remove d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script . e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; am@@ ing@@ arok is terminated ; or if the user stops a script , transm@@ its &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. for storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ah Script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be un@@ compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 is only accept script packages with the extended amar@@ ine script . for this reason you should get your script packages right properly .
the main thing has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters -@@ p to obtain the file &apos;s rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and put the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page from &amp; am@@ arok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Weight bench ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ arok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprising to use .
with &amp; am@@ arok , you can simply go to the playlist , instead of endless menus could be char@@ tered in your collection . you may also look for a very particular title of thousands of your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos;s collecting browser and quick search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you &apos;ve already got some playlist , but you can never choose which you want to hear ? then , the playlist always is difficult for you . and if your decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart playlist will automatically select the correct music according to specific criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gen@@ eric USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used , such as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and sh@@ ick - exactly the right to experience your music !
normally one must enter the following folder in the base folder of Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok and install :
da &amp; am@@ arok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should comp@@ ile no difficulties if you encounter problems , please report this in &amp; k@@ de ; ma@@ iling lists .
&amp; am@@ arok ; has how most applications require several options to activate or dis@@ able at the drive point using the configure script or de@@ activate . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ den@@ cies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements .
activ@@ ates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help at the development of &amp; am@@ arok ; you should to use it .
&amp; am@@ arok ; can be addressed without effort to setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards to teach the various functions of &amp; am@@ arok ; .
players @-@ window displays the player windows in addition to playlist , or if the option is switched off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
tuning barometer : this function is only available when &amp; am@@ ing@@ arok was compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometers .
tuning full of sound : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar was compiled . this means that the color scheme for the voting activity is changed .
sound files at the music files : this function is only available if it is enabled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored on the storage location of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok / m@@ ood@@ le / m@@ ood@@ le / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser needs &amp; am@@ arok ; started to run when a browser is needed .
to use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list .
playlist , store the current playlist , automatically stores the current playlist , if you want to lose this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist .
relative paths for manually stored playlist : if you activate this setting , &amp; am@@ arok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the storage location of the playlist , otherwise , the absolute position of music files are saved .
if you are clearly visible at the unit changes , the playlist / export window will always be rolled out to keep up the current piece in the visible window area .
when the play change to the context @-@ browser changes automatically shows the context @-@ browser , as soon as the next piece is played .
in the appearance of the appearance you can custom@@ ize &amp; am@@ arok ; s appearance . the section is sub@@ part in three parts .
in the fonts section you can use the use of different fonts in &amp; am@@ ar ; you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , Player windows and context @-@ browser . press fonts ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of user @-@ defined colour scheme , you own even the qu@@ al of choice and can set up a separate color scheme . use it with the activated color selection for front and background color .
reproduction of the start continues to continue &amp; am@@ arok ; after the program start , the playback will continue automatically with the piece at the place , with which it stopped at last .
the sub@@ window On @-@ Screen @-@ Display allows you to use the O@@ SD card . if on @-@ screen display , you can display a preview of the O@@ SD , and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click here to select the font type for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow that the text in the O@@ SD is represented .
custom colors are available to suit the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color areas will open the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not activated , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ eling function is used .
the input field text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by default of plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available spaces and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . so you can set it on which screen a multi @-@ way monitor environment will appear in the O@@ SD .
the audio output audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers enable more adjusting possibilities in this card card .
the collection card collection will be used to setup all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , select &amp; am@@ arok ; according to music files . in order to include a folder into the collection , select the check box in addition to its name . this section includes also check boxes for inser@@ ting as with the selected folders .
sub @-@ folders : this causes that &amp; am@@ arok ; both the crossed and sub @-@ folders to be used as well as their sub @-@ folders .
changes : allows &amp; am@@ arok ; to monitor the selected folders ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search will be done to make the necessary modifications to your collection .
play@@ lists import : it causes &amp; am@@ arok ; all found re @-@ playlist to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ u@@ and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection . then the added playlist will then appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver can be chosen between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another facility is required in the sub@@ window of MySQL .
the section MySQL set is used to set the database for &amp; am@@ arok . under machine : if you enter the MySQL database . after that the network port is entered into the database . name : is the database name to which the connection is manufactured .
use user@@ name : and password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the cartridge map last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ arok , the name of played pieces can be delivered to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations concerning the current piece .
here you enter your user@@ name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can record one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; am@@ arok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ter calls : after activation of this attitude is &amp; am@@ arok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the always played pieces . note : you can see the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in summary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to install C@@ deli@@ bs ( including the included programs , because &amp; am@@ arok ; requires some of them to locate modules or scripts ) . we have written a small instruction on how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as O@@ SD assumes that your window manager will hold the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . we are trying to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these represent an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can see this error on the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also depend on the cap@@ sul@@ ated file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly , there is that Tag@@ lib in reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file system crashing : please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; am@@ arok ; is a bit mature .
make sure that all of &amp; am@@ gs ; used libraries with the same compiler version . if eg &amp; am@@ arok have been compiled with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then leads this to crash when processing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate auto . switch off , if in@@ active for ... in setting up the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ stage via email ( the email opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ drop , the error is guaranteed .
this is the fact that many program data is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 in the Meta @-@ General , but not as Unicode feature . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; exists not &quot; -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; -@@ $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&amp; am@@ arok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repe@@ ating / Dynamic playlist ) can be seen in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can see the status disabled on grey and half @-@ transparent . note that one must click on a symbol until three times on a icon until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : incorrect symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ offset Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check whether am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see you with ld@@ d &apos;@@ ad@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf , that am@@ aro@@ K will first find the correct version .
there are several options . most of installation problems are the lightest through the help of a experts of your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the help of other users or for developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the Channel # am@@ arok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please bear there a mistake , if something is due to an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ arok ; there is only a blank playlist . how do music pieces come in ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files in the right part of playlist .
to be intuitive to keep the surface , the start window was converted into the statistics window . they find it under ex@@ tras .
the meaning of this symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points will be calculated automatically .
in order to evaluate pieces , the evaluation list must be displayed in the playlist , click on the titles list and select column . click anywhere in the new Review column to define the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short commands of Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then remove From playlist , from the shut@@ down menu .
draw a playlist file with the mouse in playlist and let it fall there . just as you would like to do it with other files . so simple : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Adding button , you can store the button playlist . click here .
probably , you can install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; am@@ arok package . new . also look at lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ izations .
the E@@ qual@@ izer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it about the menu bar under ex@@ tras E@@ qual@@ izer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s really true ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question of which media types does support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so fairly every single @-@ memor@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ coding the text and PNG !
it may be ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux with which the default no MP3 decoder is provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Inclu@@ sion
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; am@@ arok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the g@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink device , the device must provide a mixer for several applications to use the device at the same time , or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . take a look at the Help D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem and help a solution . for g@@ amer you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. Castle sink ) .
that does &amp; am@@ arok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media hear first de@@ coding . g@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you want to read a decade with little overhead . g@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coding and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ coding the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can spend right on AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :

probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimised for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . depending on the buffer , the less applications react to visu@@ al@@ izations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but when I would like to switch to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; am@@ arok ; from . why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all the components . perform G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask for I@@ RC Channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end you am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Load it down , comp@@ ile and install it . then enter G@@ ST @-@ register and once again as your normal user . remove the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute G@@ ST register . start now &amp; am@@ arok .

&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ f ; : bur@@ ns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; it offers all functions that also offers &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore automatically cho@@ oses &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually reaches &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases it reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burnt audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the internet such programs are considered as Ripper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented @-@ free and professional technology to use audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis and Encoder modules .
M@@ ad : here is a high quality MPEG @-@ audio decoder . it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
lame : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial entries . lame will be used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : an free Open Source codec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and compression compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module that you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
dra@@ gon@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to un@@ lock them on an audio CD .
SO@@ x : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ x is used by SO@@ x Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a functional system fully equipped car system for processing , dis@@ assembling and analyze video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
normal@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , for creating a mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections may be meaning@@ ful ; without standard alize the different recording of the various albums can result in the un@@ beautiful effect which will be different according to the music pieces .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : here it is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and play automatically all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a comfortable method , recently opened projects again . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project was once stored once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
stores the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog save is displayed , with which you can choose file and file name for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you would save for each individual project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what to happen . you can then choose between Save and Chang@@ es . Moreover , you can also break off and open the project .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will not ask for any stored project , which should be done so as you would have called for each project file .
includes all open projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for every no stored project is asked what to happen , as if you had called the file .
if you book this entry , you can choose from the current dialogue files to adding the project . this has the same effect when you come directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Bur@@ ning &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the characteristics dialog for the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project has already contains data .
opens the features dialog for the current project . here you can make many possible settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are done ? can be described ( reachable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for any active data CD / DVD or video DVD Project . it is useful to import files from a previous meeting . this is useful if you use files for a multi@@ session CD . the data of the previous session will always be used , even if this function is not used , so that you can already see the existing files and folders .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature is hated &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . this function remov@@ es no files from the medium , it fl@@ ends only those previously imported files .
opens the CD copying dialog . this allows you to create copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a CD , which you can then burn after some of the normal copy . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . it also allows you to create copying a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a DVD using the copying dialog , so the target medium has to be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for form@@ ating a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , making the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously made CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , so you have to use other tools such as No@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously made DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previous DVD video can be converted . thus , this dialogue window will usually be converted to the reading of a DVD in the content view , but also contains information about le@@ ak@@ es@@ ene video , coding settings and even options for changing the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the inserted medium . these information are represented in the site view and include characteristics of the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small vest at the bottom edge of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not attached , the status bar is bl@@ ended .
the folder view has an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the site view is enabled , their content in the content view is displayed . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media Info , lock and un@@ lock the drive or un@@ lock the medium .
the site view has a or out . the site view enables the choose and pulling files into the projection view . the site view is also the interface to read from audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head fl@@ atten@@ s in the projection view is a narrow range , which is only visible when the project view has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the proj@@ ections clear from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window for changing the key orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one has chosen one of the available commands at the top part , you can adapt the key order to the lower part .
this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . so you can set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , therefore you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programming settings will be done . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on h@@ h@@ ie@@ b . this dialogue is intended to personal@@ ize and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a Sh@@ ell@@ scriptions .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; run functions , you can either use the command program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional scope , therefore rather your taste and the kind of your task is crucial that the attached programs give you the default .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command program d@@ co@@ p . to use &amp; D@@ COP ; you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then , you will be something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; it is common , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two further parts listed below are described below .

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; it is currently supported for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( loss @-@ free compression ) . currently , lame be installed on the Linux distribution ) . more co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of &amp; CD ; read and compressed into WAV files on the computer ( loss free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the loss free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed , so it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile anything , but only if FLA@@ C is not used , it is not necessary to install any installation .
what Ko@@ di@@ er@@ aser / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer provides a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to handle a protected audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once again must be done ( the setup dialog can be viewed as often called up to a suitable configuration ) , will be explained in the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads to the understanding of the user &apos;s sl@@ ender approach via which you will be able to stum@@ ble at the start .
can convert many formats - depending on which coefficients are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can you get &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is stored manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the page you will find more information , such as this program is used as well as screens with descriptions of the registration maps for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB &apos;s CD@@ DB data is set according to the installation of en@@ quiry into the registration card CD@@ DB . ( this may be locally or online ) , in the latter case the connection is to be made to the Internet . )
when a encoder starts to read and - when a encoder is configured in the tab setting for setup d@@ ino - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , allowing you to read the selection with another encoder than the standard . it is possible to notice that before the encoder option configured in the tab setting dialog for setup dialog .
opens the file manager to en@@ code an already read file , instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ er@@ ts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for Program@@ s ( how to read out &amp; CD ; termin@@ ate ) .
opens the main setting dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different card cards ( such as encoder , to setup the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you must go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes audio quality , co@@ di@@ ers and compression rates and helps you to choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may vary for these distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , you lose information through data comp@@ ress according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above that bit rate the differences are less important because both Ko@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , lame will be supplied free with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - If only music is heard from one computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are available .
MP3 - If music is also heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music &apos;s acceptable results , and has quite a high quality . good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 GB = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of one title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate of 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good com@@ ug for music by yo@@ ungst@@ ers . good com@@ ug for music by yo@@ ungst@@ ers . but not good enough for better stereo stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting becomes ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you &apos;re absolutely the absolutely highest quality , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that will be collected manually or by the program automatically from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available as a list of parameters . they can be handed / used to generate and k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file names and features of the music files .
in connection with co@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to be encoded with lame ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s with lame be encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database in which the audio CDs can read / enter , so that all the other information can download in the machine . it is too notice that all the other information can be entered into the machine : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translation ) is not attor@@ ney . however , nobody can prevent the information on &amp; CD ; more or less value , so it can &apos;t be added to the artist nor the music company damage . all information can now be saved in a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an address to choose ( ad@@ joining an address ) . for use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used to retri@@ eve the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer that has reviewed the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b is needed , the geographical at the next @-@ lying mirror server is needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org provides a current list of mirror image for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the check out of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which output program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to be more accurate in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the matching distribution will be installed first , if this is not yet done .
to store the used WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer and therefore select the desired file format . during the opening hours there are pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss free compression for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab card .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coefficient may be used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined coefficients . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a body , further information can be obtained through the input such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; lame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have a lot of causes . check the device of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and readers of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give a hint on what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not be prosp@@ er !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can give you how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but somehow is still uns@@ af@@ e to do anything ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will get enough information about those areas that do the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , all setup and our first &amp; CD ; read it lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to use MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ boards ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as a pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files that you can always do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd has and that you own write permission ( eg ; by attemp@@ ting to copy with the quer@@ or anything ) .
the first section deals with the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something probably is done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
here we determine the compression modes for compression of music ( lame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used to use the program to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it in any case of a &amp; CD ; if once the matching settings are found .
the device name is delivered to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link on the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed . if the device can be accessed with other programs , it helps to use the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map general settings . here you don &apos;t have a lot to do . here you can define an additional conversion . in our example it will be shown as shown in screen photo .
only if you want to ask any information , you will be informed if the statements are missing for the creation of keywords ( tags ) .
the box card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download on the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected during the check @-@ out of the &amp; CD ; with the Internet , it is able to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you &apos;re un@@ happy with the database entry and file name / fil@@ en@@ ame or day entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or file name will be easily changed - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to enter everything manually , activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is more than 620 MB large , superior to this twice . however , this will be selected twice if this is to be selected . in order to get fre@@ ed@@ b in the open mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . mode is set on the following cardboard card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eve the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server on the internet . how is the system that data can be obtained ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in screen photo .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org page and watch them after a mirror server nearby . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work as well as to server the server , as many Fire@@ walls the protocol 88@@ 80 is currently bo@@ oted , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf the internet .
in this example , we want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to fre@@ ed@@ b servers should be enough to enable the first check box .
just take the settings of screen photo . ( please make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of out@@ casts simultaneously : exc@@ use me , there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one device ? parallel read and en@@ code ? the author knows it not , therefore simply try .
CD ; after reading the last denom@@ inations : cross this to the &amp; CD ; to cast out at the end of the trial .
custom file for temporary files : if you can cross it , then the path / folders can be saved in which the WAV files are saved . if the box is not checked , the files will not be crossed in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to make anything with the WAV files .
all in such as it is on the screen photo . the command is something long , under circumstances must have something right after the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the record &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of creation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1@@ &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted as required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of the tags ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
use the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this sample :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each check out of one &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; it is described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the internet is described , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from fre@@ ed@@ b is described in this section , must be repeated for any output and CD .
since we do a &amp; CD , which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen photos will see a bit different than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully retri@@ eved from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of the Internet . comments are displayed on the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &quot; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; it could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen if you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD included ; successfully completed by fre@@ ed@@ b , all the titles are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the case that there are more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which is your opinion on your &amp; CD .
if you don &apos;t have the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually redeem it by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , you need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 step 2 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo , the titles of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Re@@ eller title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ mm@@ ers per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD @-@ editor ( e.g. whether all the words begin with big letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ Tags . this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set unlimited field length , at least on the settings of the encoding settings ; throw a look in the section &apos; Fundam@@ ental Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information in the created files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers resp . file formats . see in the help of Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to obtain more information .
simply select one entry , which is obvious to the style of the selected CD ; this example is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information please refer to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , you &apos;ll come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the windows of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears again and you will see that the fields are already filled with the entered data , which we have listed for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the titles released in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and follow the same way until you have entered the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the item list .
note that there is a check sign before each line of each piece . only the titles are selected , or make sure all the pieces have been selected , or use the button all the pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at one time .
when clicking on the button select the read process , this window appears to be confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the rider orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window at the status of the window .
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer that you have not installed yet . they were not successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked the write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the game &apos;s first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and en@@ code parallel . note the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . however , the number of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the calcul@@ ator used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to read and en@@ code no problem while simultaneous reading and en@@ code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is coded , and a third order is encoded in the waiting time of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be connected with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you will need the coefficient of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is now supported by CV@@ S as part of the package below . most distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ ite ; package is available . if you read this , you have already done it ...
this section is aimed at persons compiled by source files , and not for users intended to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for assistance like the program needs to be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . best you can learn the step by step example . it shows screen photos of different boxes of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still alive ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked on , without any reference point as it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if the program is running on the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it going to be ? who reads that , probably the program started . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author may not apply this manual . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; it is always something to add or change it , may it do . at least after contact with the author . and if you want to read this section , he has agreed to this section and thus agree with this proposal .
strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others he has not have a real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real show of texts also some properties that have no other &amp; UNIX and MIDI players .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ ; support work . &amp; k@@ mid ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver that is supported for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is supported once a sequence is supported .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by pressing the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; windows to drag .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( son@@ g@@ ings or text events ) . K@@ Mid is determined automatically the process used .
seat support . if you &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song during the next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US maps ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first you can choose ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog , using its help you can select the desired song .
you can also download a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to drop in &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and feel the button Ab@@ playing in the tool bar , select the entry to play from the menu item or do the Le@@ ert@@ aste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , once you go to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will pull it . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b and drive .
if you find that a song gets too slow or to slow down , you can change to the arrows left and right of the speed display and so you can change the speed of the speed , double click on the template &apos;s screen .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button on the button , or the exit of the menu entry in the menu piece , thus breaks the playback . when no piece is played , it starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
song lyrics can be stored on two types in one piece of music . some pieces apply Tex@@ ter@@ nis , others use Lied@@ t@@ ec@@ lipse and again other both . some pieces have no text ( - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events will be displayed and even better : the event type will be automatically selected , so that you need to manually adjust the Kara@@ oke text . but you still have the possibility to change this , if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings the entries tex@@ tures or son@@ g@@ ings . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summar@@ ise . these are played the series after you . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find at the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the desired collection manager in each case .
into temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . consider that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , they must be selected in collecting manager . there you can add to the button adding a song . it appears again the file dialog with which help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setup Automatic add to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will automatically added to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atically add to the collection , it is enabled , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and re@@ cl@@ ed . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after sub@@ menu from the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be determined .
to play a song , select it in collecting manager or use the select list on the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump a song , select the Next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the preceding pieces , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button Del@@ ete .
temporary collection can &apos;t be cleared . however , it doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events will be translated into events that under@@ stands syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus whenever a trumpet should play if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US @-@ cards , FM devices , and so on ) .
unfortunately there is no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . you need to edit the corresponding file of your hand ( with your favorite bars ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications to play a unit .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear so often as desired . a prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for this is that each occurr@@ ence has different text ID ( see below ) .
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A further key@@ map ... EN@@ D define CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you see that it is necessary to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail , so I can support you in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are non @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section the patches will be specified as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is igno@@ red . it is believed that GM Pat@@ ches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M optional Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put this instrument on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is supported for example ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a fire @-@ net . this includes the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP Section :
if now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( rein@@ forcing ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file .
please note that this is meant with the concept drum patch of the patch , where each tone is another perfor@@ ating instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one that means the sound height of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument . use :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 items .
you can define several key@@ boards for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to form sounds at the Per@@ cus channel . see the included Key@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , make it easy in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP Section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
N is the channel that is depicted on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map is necessary to use the name name for this channel ! if you don &apos;t use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will ignore all events that try the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the per@@ formers patch on the Per@@ kus@@ sions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der ratio is multiplied , in which relationship pitch @-@ ben@@ der events will be multiplied with the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) would be converted and then rel@@ ayed again . the value 4096 will be used to do so in the map file no dec@@ imal com@@ mas .
this setting is used because GM is that a keyboard player will receive a sound higher with the value 4096 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards can play up to one octave . in order to find the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you will find in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these manu@@ als you can see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel you can select an instrument . if you have an instrument , the kno@@ b doesn &apos;t have green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed to play with which one song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information on how a music piece must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . so the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices , just like two different musicians that can play the same score in very different ways .
good , I can still forced to use &amp; k@@ mid ; however , a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have the control over everything .
this may happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; it happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source code ( e.g. from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no pleasure to add all files separately .
agree , therefore &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add into &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them on &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
simply activate the setup Automatic add to the collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can press the arrow button on the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop I must play if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file or I want to play a file , merely go into the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window will switch and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file without having equal to a collection , turn off the setup Automatic add to the collection , and the new file will add to a temporary collection . open from files
for example , suppose you have to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d you only want to play the first file . so , set the settings for the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then join us to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent to me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I see these songs or see the postcard , animated me , further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ ths ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my ho@@ b@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to gather MIDI files , MIDI files , music and phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you have a question , a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you will really send me a giant , if you send me a postcard from your dwelling place or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all those who want to send me a postcard or MIDI file , you should receive a MIDI file , but you should contact me when I &apos;ve got the file again .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my leisure time , and no man swe@@ pt out for money . I therefore want to make sure that I only want to get more programm@@ atic , because / if I get back feedback ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Keep the error that the pitch is too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the testing of the AW@@ E support , has Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , a error correction or also just an supported e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the net that give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage , which can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can find the development and look at the links with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound@@ card you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it runs if you would have a sound card except you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; ma@@ iling lists or send a error correction directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed for playing video files from M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , and to play DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; c@@ app@@ y ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer has been installed .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new releases , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . it &apos;s always the window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will be displayed only if information is found in it .
it is possible to accept the preferred connections under the menu . if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other , you should use the category thum@@ b playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an extra hier@@ arch@@ est@@ u@@ fe . if you add an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and play it with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and thum@@ b playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML Configuration files . it is also possible to select the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / c@@ m@@ player / , can also select from the menu view and as next handling mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group will only display the XML content of this part .
after changing XML files , select from the menu on the same with playlist , or select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the processing mode leave or select another group without paying the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML Configuration files ..
the animation at starting and end can be de@@ activated by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change of &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to activate any other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / bit .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ m@@ player / external / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at start does not need to be short , it will stop automatically by opening a different source . this would result in the end animation , but the user can end the application a second time .
an easy example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ ite ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = &quot; in@@ defin@@ ite &quot; sr@@ c = &apos; me@@ et ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ work ; In the source testing of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider to the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here you can set the path from the player and the intermediate @-@ size of the data flow from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here the output of m@@ player is evident .
there is no rider for this playback set in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ ab @-@ Mozilla :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be played the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist .
so the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , you need to play &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog for assign@@ ments of K@@ DE .
the quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a console application to browse and after error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error occur , the back@@ end output within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this means a pre@@ heated back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined also ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on can play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards either by using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured to use the tool and TV channels , the scanner can be edited manually , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rek@@ order ) Settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog for Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be ports to be found . the encoding must be found ( e.g. PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably contain a DVB in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only work X@@ Video too ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . in this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . therefore , the video server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .

yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is working as a user root after the integration of the device . make sure that / dev / c@@ drom calls on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU have to be tested on their performance every time ?

lat@@ ex ; : a professional character application . under Unix style systems probably used on the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; or &amp; Tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation disc should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ ile and are included on the k@@ ile ; website included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions have to be taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation desired , the contact is to be produced on the k@@ ile ; website .

the same as other recording languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to be specified by the general properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text gr@@ it with the text . the introduction shows at least the command \ \ review in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ &apos; .
the quick entry @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a further feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assist@@ ants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ pp ) offers some places for creating the document . it can also be rendered to the document @-@ related att@@ itudes .
documentation classes : this is to be used to document the type of the document : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; pro@@ pul@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
coding : this is the character encoding of the system . modern systems do not use UTF @-@ 8 encoding than standard . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most frequently used packages for r &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for the connection it only will be arranged in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ entation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN @-@ Regulations ) . they should always be used in creating German texts .
new users are now no wor@@ ries . it is merely a brief description of the functions and more information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - same as other source text editors , showing settings and elements ( as well as the appropriate text ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; you should consider that any mathematical environment could not be closed . however , it will still be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and .
with the automatic adjustment of the environments ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { Command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a space @-@ line ( e.g. \ \ , { Command } ) , this function can be de@@ activated in the menu of the command ; such as La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encouraged the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the most of the lowest and sub@@ tle the lowest element ) :
in view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed through a mouse click on the respective hardware .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ ated file ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewing for the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information like the font type and is available in addition to PDF the current output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and print out of DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the cleaning , the elements of the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked with the editor , and once on a element in the DVI ; file text was cli@@ cked on the exact opposite . once on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is cli@@ cked on the respective passage in the DVI ; slide viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function is simplified using several files . using a master document the work is simplified using other embedded .@@ tex files . using a project can be set up a project @-@ wide master document for project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if no error occur in the source text ) .
file Outlook : in this mode the DVI ; file is expected to be monitored by the following signal , and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
in consideration of the processing tool bar , the three gro@@ wers selection fields should be developed . the first selection field is designed for fast relief of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... Sub@@ ject &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division :
the selection field Further is for entry of articles such as Tags , Fu@@ Ã . notes or references . the available rates are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( selection above a selection field ) .
when using quot@@ ation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . it works only if the file is necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has written good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are also written in &amp; k@@ ile ; written by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gra@@ Ã ¶ t is used for the definition of the fonts for the main text , which will be defined on the box notes , etc . there are the following fonts for disposal :
when calling by &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection criteria are available : 1 . the Assistant for creating a new document is written by selecting the document type and legend of the settings . 2 . the document may be written by reason using the hand .
the brackets according to the command \ \ interval class included the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the fonts . if the font is not fixed at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the ob@@ stru@@ cted source code has to be entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text must be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this is the use of the menu building or the button of quick construction .
the source code must be stored in front of the compilation . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
the compilation of the document should be sought after errors . when using quick construction and ey@@ epi@@ ece ; it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered .
a setting ( English ) is a text that will be treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font e is created . for example , a report with the font names are created , \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; . the order to reach the font in the surrounding area in the surrounding area ( ... ) .
the changes only will be supervised within the surrounding area ( \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s } to \ \ &apos; s ) . there is no difficulty in the surrounding area ( number ) within a environment .
there are many options for the possibility of reading and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it enables you to obtain certain fonts , grease pressure , cur@@ si@@ ves , etc . these commands are either with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the surrounding area .
\ \ Beg@@ in { em@@ ph } : this command is for the cur@@ si@@ onal pressure and is long as long as long until it is closed with a \ \ bottom { em@@ ph } or another environment . a single word in a set can be recur@@ sively represented by \ \ em@@ ph { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote from the document . the quote begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ &apos; { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to the writing of the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the recording language is now displayed , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
as soon as in the assistant a bit text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . this should be a quote , some places in the fat and cur@@ si@@ onal pressure , and a po@@ em to the application to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document has been viewed , via editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be turned back to the editor ( with an external viewer ) . when an external viewer needs to be closed in the window .
once the DVI ; file is created , the document may be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an unknown file format ( English . D e V ice I n@@ ally ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi Edition like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter , or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; files are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then it can print the document using a file ( if the printer is correct ) .
the tool bar is able to convert the transformation of DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source text was created , the conversion can begin to open other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the advance search for the direct jump from the editor to the added position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setup for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; you only need to set up Modern under Settings ... tools Building .
in order to fix the required search , the mouse must be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on pre@@ fix . the jump to the respective place in the DVI ; slide viewer is then so@@ unded .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document and the corresponding line calls . must be specified as text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
should when using quick @-@ mounted &amp; DVI ; viewer can not be seen , a mistake should be an error , this should appear in the log file or displayed in the news window .
the log file extension refers to the error source in the source code . the log file will always be displayed on the line , in which the error appears . to consider the incorrect line , the error message must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log scheme and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to incorrect line .
once the button is cli@@ cked on the tool bar , a window will appear to select a window available for the document . the pre @-@ set values are :
selecting the empty document , a document may be written either from the ground or the assistant to create a new document . further information is included in the section .
high @-@ based users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates and templates are created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / Lat@@ ex ; file would be created or a new file created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and create a selection of file template from document .
when creating a new document , some character labels will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character coding ) . these variables can be set in settings with settings ...
when creating the own template it is necessary to know what character strings can be replaced by what variables are :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this character string will be replaced by the input in documentation class . typically they will be used as follows : \ \ Control Class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the Assist@@ ants and the associated entry for the commands in editor . as soon as the document created on this way , m@@ Ã ¼ s@@ sen has been completed :
when creating a new document , then the own template can be arranged instead of the standard period .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created . a simple way to create a template it should search for one on the Internet and can be kept under described steps below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; Lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for the tools are made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his testimonies are to be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found there directly with the reading of the chapter by &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command conference which can be accessed via the help of the La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can contain almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click button to view the &amp; tex ; word to cover the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way the clicking on \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ certified ski@@ p is only \ \ par .
when pulling out the text with the left mouse button , the full text is automatically copied to clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with sliding switch box , you can also relax parts of the source text in the editors window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most different types of spring @-@ tex@@ tures and these produce . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can be found . there is a separate type of book@@ marks in the text . the menu entry or the corresponding key stamp is highlighted the jump to the n@@ ast or last jump . thus , this diving stamp is highlighted so that they will automatically be controlled during the first input of a character .
the processing is probably one of the main aspect of use with a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; even though &amp; Kate ; already excellent standards have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for their selection . &amp; lat@@ ex ; ben@@ chmarks for their selection . under processing , the following commands are contained in the text selection :
if a single paragraph consists of ( group of lines containing on both sides a blank line ) . this extended significance can be close to tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source tex@@ tured . this is the only clear thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; it is therefore separated by two empty lines .
the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an enlarged meaning since this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a large star ( \ \ ) and a large star ( * ) at the end .
to place a part of a document can be removed from this first . &amp; Kate ; offers the key@@ code C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands to provide a faster mask . under processing the following commands are included :
the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; k@@ ile ; the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description of the processing unit .
it has already been clear that environments offers a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; so , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further commands under processing environment for a good work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the surroundings .
with this command , at the end of the current surroundings ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surroundings .
when the cur@@ sor is placed before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { vicinity } , it will be spec@@ kled at the end of the surrounding area ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of missing environmental commands , this command can be lost quickly . this command closes the last modified environment , so that the buff@@ alo environment structure is not possible .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups which are determined by brackets { ... } . under processing te@@ X group are a few important commands to meet the surrounding area .
with this command , at the beginning of the current group convers@@ ations ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the fast@@ eners .
with this command , at the end of the current group convers@@ ations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the shut@@ ters .
when the cur@@ sor is before or behind the soft cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of welded assemblies , groups par@@ enth@@ es@@ es can be lost quickly . this command closes the last modified group , so that the tigh@@ tened structure of the &amp; tex ; group is not possible .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; two simple beginnings are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign for the purpose of purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple beginnings is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close door signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic introduction of the double Anf@@ al settings can be included in settings ... La@@ Te@@ X - and be left .
there are also possible specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ally or French ) and thus either German or French pre@@ vent@@ ative signs . there are also many other languages available .
in the drums of Shift ; Inclu@@ des &amp; k@@ ile ; a smart Z@@ eil@@ ing breaks . if the current position within a lists surrounding area ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is located , not only a line tri@@ cky , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close within the tables and surrounding area , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with a close @-@ end line breaks down .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . this enables you to set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some users are classified in tables in tables and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; k@@ ile ; seeks to ex@@ h@@ ort . although this tab@@ ulator will not be connected in the subsequent line . although this tab is not the da@@ isy , for the columns position of the current tab@@ s .
although &amp; Kate ; already offers a good source code reading , these in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . there are three different modes . these are three according to requirements and the other two are for automatic transmission . all these modes can be configured for different working modes including settings ...
when you start a new environment using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { vicinity } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ &apos; to an empty line ( for the text ) by an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the check button is removed , the last letter of the input will be removed and it is possible to understand the ful@@ fill@@ ment list . on the other hand , the list can also be sc@@ aled by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed too . alternatively , a simple jump to these positions can be made possible , so that a simple jump to these positions can be made possible , and the parameters can be found .
under Settings ... establish ... k@@ ile ; complete settings to these lists are done . there will be different types of wine @-@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders and protection of general voice used .
the command mode is not suitable for the completion of environments . it will always be entered into a large list with \ \ Beg@@ in . on the other hand , the environments will often be used with ambient conditions . on the other hand , the environments are used so often , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for trans@@ missions in environments .
when calling the complete processing of the menu or the key@@ code Alt + Shift button , the command is automatically tigh@@ tened and it appears in \ \ Beg@@ in . afterwards , the environment is continued on the sim@@ pl@@ est way and can be completed by pressing the input button .
once again this is closed , the surroundings will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognize that it is a lists of environment , even the first \ \ item instruction is supported .
under Settings ... establish ... k@@ ile ; complete settings to these lists are done . this mode uses the authentic@@ ate list of the insured mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; set custom lists of ab@@ outs that are immediately replaced by means of higher character strings . as an example of a separate string , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l is contained in the example of the record L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L was entered and the word is covered by the menu of the menu or the key@@ word C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large numbers are not helpful for automatic loading . however , it was found that many w@@ alled in a document are written more than once . that offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the total amount for all written vou@@ chers are written .
this mode can be set up in the menu of K@@ ile ... K@@ ile compar@@ isons are required . here , the sw@@ elling value for displaying results can be specified .
the complete renovation files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode . mode is available for shut@@ down ( ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ nal ) or tex .
the dialog graphics establishes the entry of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not so known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for both sides and new orders of pages . the PDF output will be re @-@ arranged and then converted the pages with a few &amp; poster script ; tools are newly ordered and then converted with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to promote the outcome of work , you need to comp@@ ile the source code . all tools are group@@ ed in the menu of creating comp@@ iling , creating and create creation .
for the compilation of the source code for viewing as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by using Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file converted into a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command quick construction , a viewer will usually be called after the compilation . this should not be used for a new window , so it will be a new window .
a new project is presented to the project New Project .... The following information is asked for the project :
when running the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the alignment of EC@@ MAS@@ TER@@ -@@ Ko@@ de . scripts and scripts in the vertical bars are managed .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be changed in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ;
the first must be said that the evaluation environment of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) features the following methods :
&amp; Lat@@ ex ; is a fairly detailed system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . it offers a lot of different help to under@@ go the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ ex ; are delivered with many documents . there are a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a complete re@@ mot@@ ely re@@ mot@@ ely for all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is a fully @-@ to @-@ use manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a certain form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; it is divided into three important marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ ex ; the fin@@ ances of the right document is not always easy . as m@@ ful help , the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all too &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the best advantage is the search for par@@ cel name or stroke . of &amp; k@@ ile ; then the results will be displayed .

the plug @-@ plug@@ ins , the &amp; quantitative ; even may have little too . therefore , the plug@@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone can use the desired in &amp; quantitative ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used below .
to install a plug@@ in or a box , let &apos;s start with the menu plug@@ ins . the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows all plug@@ ins to manage and add new plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search engine . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; quantitative view ; this path for searching plug@@ ins .
often , several people work in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with one another . &amp; quantitative relationship ; support the speci@@ fying of Team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties @-@ Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . N@@ ick@@ name is the first name of user and serves for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team manager and sub @-@ project manager .
the user can look out of the list of te@@ amm@@ ite members who he is . this happens to ex@@ presses the team member from the list and ex@@ presses the S@@ etze button . currently , the current member ( their identification ) is to be released after you are : text .
top names and attitude of their own identity are important concerning messages and comments . see further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of her team , there is another advantage through the recording of members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team manager if something particular occurs . see for further information .
event promotions are promotions that will be executed if something specific in the project is done . one example would be the opening of opening and closing of a message if a file is secured , or a script that will play a file into CV@@ S as soon as they will be added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project settings dialog can be created events , processed and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ ressing address given in the receiver list . add@@ res@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such ladder can be established .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal reviews by the following things :
note that comments is simple . it can be selected either by the note -@@ entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment area followed by an@@ ati@@ fication text .
ann@@ ot@@ ations can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax of the team manager is a role in the project manager of the team leader Sub@@ project leader In the scope of the field and sub@@ project managers , the corresponding range or sub@@ project names should be given as in the examples below .
the nick@@ name and rollers names are independent of large or small , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; quantitative information ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing , the DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic is and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; quantitative Settings ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be addressed via settings Qu@@ anta . the dialog box covers some pages that will be treated retro@@ spec@@ tively .
the behaviour of &amp; quantitative information ; regarding tags including car complete can be changed . the entries are :
large / Classi@@ fi@@ eds of tags : large / Klein@@ sch@@ abor@@ tion of tags : large / Classi@@ fication means , the tags are inserted so inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / Classi@@ fication of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks : large / Klein@@ sch@@ ema of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks : large / Classi@@ fication of automatically added At@@ tri@@ butions , the attributes are inserted so inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if attached , it is optional for tags that are optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and finished day automatically : when on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic transformation of acute characters into the corresponding coding during application .
m@@ ime types : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of various types of files . using the standard , the default data can be recovered .
standard character encoding : coding of newly created or in other ways to open the file ( where the encoding of the file can be addressed ) , but this setting will be downloaded from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting will be run by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quantitative ; created regularly backup copy , such as a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . additionally , this is not the same as the saving of the file . additionally , it is not stored on a backup regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editors of view or own view ( or the documentation in a cartridge ) which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the window settings on the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface are caused by changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameters .
the haz@@ ard warning area serves as a result of the possibility to retri@@ eve view of warning by h@@ anger from non @-@ canc@@ ers .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text in divided mode . regarding different modes see .
here is the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , in detail .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to modify the structure of the structure with the mouse pop @-@ up action .
in the structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in tree can be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are automatically opened during an amendment to the structural tree . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups such as empty groups are found in the current document .
the area for placing ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) can be un@@ folded in groups , each may be divided into groups , each may be valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; s that means it can be valid as a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ y@@ ab@@ brevi@@ ation is valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are part of the third page that can be used by any K@@ part @-@ capable application , best @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . adding a plug @-@ in , the following plug@@ ins must be specified :
address : the path to the plug@@ in if it is not at a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is transferred to the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding file ( path of current file ) or project folders .
load component in &quot; Only @-@ reading &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is denied the shop . only @-@ reading @-@ parts refuse to load if this option is not chosen .
check the plug@@ in : is it enabled , then test@@ et &amp; quantitative ; if the specified information is correct , then the plug@@ in is not available at the moment when the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting has been developed completely . the support for which no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , such as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of which a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept has been implemented , which allows different implem@@ ent@@ ations over plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative ; included .
the use of the deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button options , in addition to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in selection field , specific settings can be changed .
if you want to activate a deb@@ ug@@ ger , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally , it appears on the left @-@ hand Dock .
a view , in which all holding points are listed , with line numbers and conditions , is usually in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger is usually shown in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the monitor , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug@@ in with to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ger requirements . this promotion is opened by default when a project is opened , so that a deb@@ ug@@ ger must not be counted on it .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging Session Star@@ te meeting the meeting . closes the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ate the l@@ ute to meet requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug request . this is equal to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is shown in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
indicates the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of script and information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line will continue . if this is done , the execution will be continued , the script will start with the requirement .
points out the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the design of the script , without information to over@@ watch variables and the current line number . if this is done , the execution continues , the execution begins as soon as a request is provided .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include :
points out the deb@@ ug@@ ger to go and go to the next way , than there would not be the current .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which will be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variation of the variation .
with this dialog can be entered a variable or a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can custom@@ ize &amp; quantitative ; you can custom@@ ize your needs and help you to get better .
documentation type E@@ ditions packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative parameters , as well as services for market and scripts . their simp@@ licity and flexibility makes out &amp; quantitative information ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web@@ developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the tag languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; DT@@ EP files are handy , symbo@@ lically @-@ oriented glue from image buttons ( above the editing window ) , text and instructions faster into a document , as a user ever could .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be executed ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about transformation .
this document describes how the XML files are created , then the &amp; clari@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tool@@ bars . short , an &amp; DT@@ EP .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the original u@@ res@@ cu@@ og@@ es , den &amp; quantitative ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool aff@@ ord enable a quick insertion of tags in a document without any risk of a typ@@ ew@@ rit@@ er .
tag files are not a folder . they contain only the &amp; dis@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of writing language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and clear whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better viewing and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . all about the possibilities and limits are placed in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can contain only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains no one element type about itself otherwise .
the type of the tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the class type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the Type Method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ bute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; Tag . this is an only element type element .
describes an attri@@ bute a tags . this element can only occur once for each attri@@ bute . additionally , there is another tags that describe how this attri@@ bute is to be displayed , etc ; This is an only element type element .
specifies the sources used for the attributes in the tag editors dialog , and in the attri@@ bute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . d@@ co@@ p interface within and quantitative data is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; quantitative ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and method name . the arguments that are given to the method can be empty . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tags .
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur for an attri@@ bute description only once . it is an element type element .
tables the position of the attri@@ bute tex@@ tual of a tags within a dialog box . this day can occur only once in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for any field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ch@@ ased and closed .
space characters have nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; Tool@@ bar &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog appears above in &amp; quantitative ; -@@ window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . at present , check out only during the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative ; .
in the following example , an example for a family 1 @-@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the file name for this day XML file would be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file function will be described . the file name of this day XML file is supposed to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; database _ name &quot; type = &quot; option _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; clari@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as well as simple and there is a editor that can be edited via DT@@ D automatically ; for one of a list of selectable &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it should be created for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; Version = using de 1 for &amp; quantitative ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D ( / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) N@@ ick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as N@@ ick@@ name .
a action can be set up with the settings ... and click the new action to the same dialogue :
this action can be assigned a button . with clicking on the user you can assign a button zel to remove a key@@ chain .
the easiest actions . it can be entered into detail in the detail and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; quantitative dialog ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs .
for example , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ a variable in the command line , such as sh % scri@@ pt@@ . / actu@@ a / scripts in its path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / out of the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ; only one instance is running , the text is useful to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if the COP is used to control the P@@ ID number ; the external script is used by the external script .
the parameters for this event usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods , a script input of &amp; quantitative parameters can be specified on the standard input . in the selection field input can be determined , which is to send to the default value . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally meaning@@ ful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue , to the default output , error messages can be specified on the default issue written by the value of the selected text issue :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in the case it is necessary to create a separate tool@@ bar . in the case it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you must add the actions and configure the settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts the edit mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the day attri@@ bute has and you plan their use , activate dialogue &quot; tag &quot; when available , so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a h@@ ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have trouble .
for creating a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; use Graphics Other Program@@ s ( or where else it is in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to realize what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ;
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to user signal , click here to insert this symbol at least once ; -@@ day in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must be connected to the action . this happens over the menu with settings . ( in &amp; quantitative ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text box there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button on the button and continue with other tags , so there are , or confirm you with OK .
suppose you want some common &amp; quantitative ; functions for tool@@ bar complement or it should be shared this for a better overview through some separ@@ ator into several groups . make sure that the tool@@ bar can be selected via settings . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( quite left ) for my tool@@ bar . according to the selection of the element , the tool@@ bar should be added , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
I want to preview for example a quick way to access the quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator will support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool bar may believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ kno@@ b the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by test of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure to the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder , but your tool@@ bar ( n ) should be stored in the right folder . please fit your tool@@ bar ( s ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most recent extension of &amp; quantitative information ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you like . for this chapter describes this chapter as I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory , if anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we &apos;ll have to leave the first part here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example php@@ 42 / # elements in the Main Index Top Element = Your description for these docum@@ ent@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation = Sec@@ 2.1.@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , No. 2 , tag@@ 3 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c thee = php@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 @-@ Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = En@@ code , ... Basic Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = Reg@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ taxes . html ...
please note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . that shows that there is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess boxes ( except the understanding ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it out .
note that the table of contents can be refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent in the upper end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
space characters have nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; based &amp; quantitative information ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ ums will be replaced .
the content section is the range of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be sensiti@@ vely sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts for the m@@ ys@@ q@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and file connectors .
a simple list of sol@@ ving separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can store your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and according to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quantitative / doc / apps for local and global use . then create a folder ( as indicated this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are certain that these good and it is worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative ; are you not alone . it is possible to share resources ( DT@@ EP pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else . at different places there is an email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email to send tool tool@@ bar with email , in context menu of files and folders inside the templates and scripts .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where our team will be reviewed and only available for the publication . to copy a full post , we recommend the resources to sign up for a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . therefore , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team as well as for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) or in the case that you have a number of keys , the input fields must be completed ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking on the upload button .
the upload can be up@@ loaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) , tool tool@@ bar loading , and in context menu of files and folders inside the templates and scripts are begun .
after downloading a resource , even before the installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quantitative . in case of problems it war@@ ns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not able to work by an DT@@ EP package . however , it may be time consuming because hundreds of day files can be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a DT@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and Convert a DT@@ D menu . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D @-@ description which is to be used . after that the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / demo@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Defin@@ itions : the string chain that will appear in ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d appear
fine adjustment of the DT@@ EP according to the conversion : if activated , bring &amp; quantitative ; after converting the &amp; clari@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quantitative ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and full benefit from and quantitative concepts . this chapter has to offer exactly these concepts , without their understanding and quantitative ; little use .
in &amp; quantitative ; is the work area divided into three sections : global , locally and projects . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quantitative ;
global elements are available for everyone , der &amp; quantitative ; uses , available . of tool@@ bars over actions , everything is selected as global , in the common folder of &amp; quantitative tool ; this enables the group of administrators to secure various tool actions , actions and patterns in the global tree that are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local items represent a personal collection of web development funds for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are saved in user directory , so that they can only use this user individually .
proj@@ ecting elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; pattern up to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most restri@@ cts size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which means the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editors window , the building user , the cart@@ ei@@ it@@ ers with in@@ fos and tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for more information about these areas .
you can click with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document @-@ matching entries , like to close the current , other or all cart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites , re@@ load or upload the document , jump to an book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editors of the editor lead to another context menu ( cut / copy / insert / insert ) , processing of under the mouse poin@@ ter , help the word under mouse poin@@ ter , or open the file , if the mouse poin@@ ter is called a file .
at the top end of the editors window the tool@@ bars of the Ed@@ itors . currently taking &amp; quantitative ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional is shown as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars are shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quantitative ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated with the user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in their document , click the icon to insert the day . now they should insert the data on this straight day ( such as anch@@ ors ) , insert and fill in a dialog for different fields .
the man@@ oeu@@ vre ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information about &amp; quantitative ; to navigate to open and walk . in the depic@@ ting with cart@@ ei@@ re@@ it@@ ers are available for files , project , pattern , scripts , attributes and documentation assemblies .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quantitative information . this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as Adding , removing , upload or delete the files from the storage medium can be performed with which then displayed context menu .
another option of &amp; quantitative ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which connection they are used . the category is always available , local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are only available in the project . more to templates are available .
here you can find information about the script scripts . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can call the available information on a script . you can download other functions like the script , edit or send an e @-@ mail .
with this view , one illustrates the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ click of an element , the cur@@ sor will open on the position of the element . by right @-@ click of an element list , a list of commands to navigation and loading of the tree .
this tree appears under the other building inten@@ tions . it can change rapidly attributes and name spaces . this allows the change of all available attributes with few clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can create custom documentation for &amp; quantitative information ; you can create custom documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default and quantitative information ; two cartridge units at the bottom end of the window that can be reached via the user @-@ to @-@ use information : the news window and the problem window .
this cartridge re@@ iter shows information on each in Qu@@ anta running script . so , e.g. the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D is displayed .
this cartridge re@@ iter shows all mist@@ akes in the current document . &amp; quantitative ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quantitative ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and you get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; quantitative ;
another feature of &amp; quantitative ; is the ability to send a tool bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; quantitative information is sending the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool bar in an e @-@ mail , you can secure this in &amp; quantitative ; as any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the location of &amp; quantitative ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf might get a number of options that can be transferred to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems at start of &amp; quantitative ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folders . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quantitative ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative design ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions .
during the effort to do the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; quantitative and editor ; an independent , exten@@ dable mark@@ up @-@ language editor would be ? well , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above mentioned rights must be taken , that &amp; quantitative information is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ rum@@ ours is not only possible to expand , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative information , as they need it for their need .
&amp; quantitative information ; allows Web developers to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can expand productivity almost every task . by the program comp@@ resses you can notice &amp; quantitative information . ( more about it in . )
&amp; quantitative ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quantitative ; Plus is not connected in any way with commercial versions of &amp; quantitative ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in details documentation is available with help : / quantitative ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter or hel@@ p@@ center help : / quantitative ) .
&amp; quantitative ; is currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ ix Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick list of files that you have opened . this list changed every time you can open a file , which is not found on it , the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project advance booking , only an error is reported .
converted from the clip@@ board to include special characters to &amp; HTML ; write , so that they are correct and not understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; compression , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used on the insertion of &amp; URL ; s in the anch@@ ors tag .
switches the recorder to or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; the error messages are available !
is looking for a character string or regular print@@ out in selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined trig@@ gers to help you .
shows the message window , or not to . that is the window where you can see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
exit and insertion of the problem re@@ por@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you have to change to the structure .
shows the symbol@@ ise links from the main window . this column allows you to set the book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if you are book@@ marks in the current file , they will be fore@@ seen in the menu with the entries preceding or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a existing project from hard disk . &amp; quantitative information ; projects are stored using the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory for new files that could be there . enabling you to copy graphic files to your project folder or folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project onto the server height . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded other input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quantitative ; the project managed . in chapter &amp; quantitative information ; projects are explained for details .
invites you a project of project tools . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are available only in this menu if you have assigned this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it is created only by the name . actions have to store the tool . tool@@ bars are saved via tool@@ bars , or you will be asked when asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remov@@ es a tool bar from the field of view . if you don &apos;t delete the tool bar not stored , you will be asked if you want to do that .
with this means you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps at the &amp; quantitative ; team that is present the tool@@ bar in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endix .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server where any other can access it . see in .
load an &amp; DT@@ D ; you can use or anything other of other and convert into the &amp; quantitative format ; own label format .
loading / ref@@ res@@ h the re@@ alities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; is meaning@@ ful if the extraction of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this globally is and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not available , failed .
this menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current day entry dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific under@@ way .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activated the smart insert of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; quantitative information is denied when this day is denied on this site .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed below the above menu points . click here . click on a activated plug@@ ins disabled .
select the syn@@ taxes mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ on schem@@ es depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line identification . very useful if you know people know the other OS platforms to the developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the T@@ id@@ y external application .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , it may cause time to cause or un@@ nice graphics . it is also recommended to use the default card mode , which corresponds to the default setting in &amp; quantitative mode ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu item contains an entry . the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated for each open window .
the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative view ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ master .
is the behavior of the editors window . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete or add entries from the tool@@ bars or which can follow the sequences .
this should create a assistance in accordance with the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quantitative form , you will find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top from top to bottom , since e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project features will be set .
here is the name for the project , for example , fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine , which you want to access , except for local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if this field is empty , the default settings of the selected protocol is used . depending on the remote computer , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project is stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files used for various projects should be adjusted instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects should be adjusted instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great when you have static web content you want to download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ side script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) , you need to proceed differently .
notice that files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be mounted . if a project is rest@@ art@@ ed on the project , do not apply .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of good quality .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files through an@@ lin@@ ens or , by removing the bun@@ ch , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant includes three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with project features in the menu tree in sub @-@ window profiles , or with the Push @-@ button Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some adjustments correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in described below . the additional entries will be explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) can be igno@@ red in projects such as project folders .
complem@@ entary option to the above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project , can be read more about projection views .
this enables you to select the desired de@@ bug . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin can be set using the button options . in this case the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is described .
in sub @-@ window profiles , high @-@ voltage profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile , by hand a separate building view for each profile .
in sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the sub @-@ window event configuration , one can change event promotions , or delete these actions , change or delete . event actions are executed if a pre @-@ specific event happens , such as the back@@ ing of a file . see in details .
by default it opens &amp; quantitative ; the last project that was opened . this behavior is not able to influence this behavior .
to open a different project , choose Project ... from the Menu Project or the Symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog window will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; Pl@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will automatically be stored . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quantitative ; changed files . the same happens if you download a new project .
the project view are free access to the files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
folders should also be open , however , the entries must be opened and open with ... in the right button of mouse click menu menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the place of high output files . see .
allows removing the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will cut off to prevent removing .
the password will be kept in the kernel and be forgotten by the program . this possibility is useful if frequency upload files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the plate is not coming into question .
this will stop the transfer or leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the upload .
in &amp; quantitative ; many high @-@ load profiles can be created and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile will be displayed on this dialog :
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( locally ) and NFS .
port for transfer . normally , this must not be changed , except the administrator administrator manages a service not at the usual port .
depending on your Ang@@ st@@ shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . please do not use it after your discretion . the password will be saved on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be easily read , but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project , i.e. , by simple di@@ pping the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quantitative ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantitative and quantitative information .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; quantitative ; best across the menu tool@@ bars are stack@@ ed . use and adding tool will be treated below in the section adding tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bar and symbols can be created either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New Action , a New tool@@ bar can remove any tool@@ bar or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool can be visible .
by calling the context menu to a action ( icon ) on a tool bar , the entries must be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool can aff@@ ord and set the actions in the menu with Settings tool set and set the settings ..
templates are essential documentation , code Schnitz@@ el and files for lin@@ king . &amp; quantitative file ; used as a usual file system with advanced organisation and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any on the system existing directory in the template tree . templates have in &amp; quantitative methods ; in about the restrictions you want to set up for the file system .
some with &amp; quantitative ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions on the beginning of any template that be used exactly .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file besides text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are normally inserted in documents using a link below global templates . further information on the templates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text documentation . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , a simple sc@@ aff@@ le for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is necessary on a template but the same text area can be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment through a complete volume system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates .
as the name says , these templates are serving as a templates . they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a file structure , in a compressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quantitative information .
design a documentation structure to expos@@ ures ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File Recovery Save As Local template ....
as soon as it is done , note that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see below the project tree .
select your text in your document and store it as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be moved with pulling and place on the construction site templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a template folder . it can be used all file management functions so for example , pulling and insert or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a folder on the right and file files to a folder on the right and secure site template to secure a name for the template and secure it as a default folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project Management allow a very goal oriented approach . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ prints or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link with them . additionally you can keep some things when using templates in projects very deep in mind .
the template structure in the basement templates are based on the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / demo@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / demo@@ a / templates / templates / quantitative / templates and export / quantitative / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as stated above .
to define the behavior of a folder , in the template page with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu properties tab . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is bl@@ ended , as soon as the ter@@ ist@@ al attributes are hei@@ rs .
this is by default and fit for everything except the master folders in the template . if a trunk folder is set as it would be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , it is likely to be in a trunk file .
allows four or re@@ compiled text for templates into this folder . this might be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a certain project and allows copying of ingredients in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot lines a complete presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot lines .
in addition , we also have a context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantitative ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; and source text editor which can be reached via the menu section . the first mode replaces the source text in two parts : the source code editor and V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and turn back into the source code editor described in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol symbol@@ ises the V@@ oh@@ and@@ án from &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit these directly with the V@@ PL ; editor is still possible to edit this code editor . there is no plans to change this behavi@@ our@@ al behaviour .
the second mode works exactly like the first , but that at the same time the changes are activated in the source code editor and the cur@@ sor in the source text editor and in V@@ PL ; this mode is activated , this mode is already active , the key pressure on the active cur@@ sor is activated by one window to the point where the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . you can choose between synchron@@ ization according to one click or automatically . on the selection you can automatically select the period . basically the recommendation : a small span for fast calcul@@ ator and a large range of fun for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the documentation of the visible tags during work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document using the V@@ PL ; editor is used . this allows the reduction of the suspension process . this means that you can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information on the document itself e.g. impact words for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added below the two switching areas below or removed . a click on the list allows the modification of the in@@ hal@@ tes , such as key words in the column name and key@@ word key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content of the column .
CSS rules are the new way of design of the design of pages in browser . you can add CSS rules to the list below the list or delete . a change on the list is exactly like with the met@@ a elements . the processing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to put an external CSS style template by clicking on the file button and cho@@ oses the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ sor is like in a text processing , possible thanks to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is possible . the selection can be inserted as usual . lyrics can be inserted by ti@@ pping and re@@ boot using back button or re@@ boot .
the insertion of tags will be made in the same way about the tool@@ bars as in the source text editor . there is to be aware that the insertion of tags are not removed before@@ hand , e.g. an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed every other ambient temperature .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assist@@ ent or the Listen @-@ assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; later , in this release , tables or lists of tools need to be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for analysis of styles . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ li@@ cles , the search for sty@@ li@@ ous elements is possible and the execution of sty@@ li@@ osis can be tra@@ cked .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ ile you need except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries are lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present with a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already present .

when the command is executed &quot; Search &quot; will create a x@@ ml file called search@@ resul@@ ts@@ .x@@ ml . this file can then be processed with a user defined style template to display the data in other form , if the option &quot; -@@ html &quot; is not displayed , the file search@@ res@@ ult@@ .@@ txt is displayed .

there are many graphic tools for the same . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contributions had done many changes and corrected the inclusion in many places . another program@@ mers had changed many text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts to merge .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the recovery had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , any amount of more useful features were added .
if you would like to compare it quickly , copy it into the clip@@ board and add it into one of the comparative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ like file browser .
also 3 @-@ way @-@ merge is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of body and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps the dis@@ closures of conflict and shows the result at the same time . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result of three Qu@@ ell files when merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also perform the same and merge folders . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and di@@ ver@@ ed the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed clearly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters you can see at a glance at a summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble more if no one changes the recovery . )
when a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates that file is different . red color does that both differ to files .
if all files have the same names , but in different folders , you can make the ti@@ pp@@ work easier by using just the file names from the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 -@@ target Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der 2 folder Fol@@ der 1 folder with folder 3 folder ( 2 folder ) Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Fol@@ der
opening dialog allows manual input of file names . open dialog will review your selection and shows them once again . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file . if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
using the Button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , then use the same or merge of folders . if for A , select a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active for the target and is not necessarily required . however , it is not necessarily necessary to establish an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the button button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set the options before you start with the compar@@ isons / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare all the file , but only parts of a text . it allows you to pull text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts then immediately . in the opening dialog you will need to select any files , you can simply connect the dialog with the ab@@ oo@@ king button .
you can also use pulling and insert : simply drag one file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it rise over a comparative window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file would like several similar functions . if you would like to figure out how these functions are needed , they would have to download two respective files , download them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and compare these relevant sections simply , insert and then compare it .
note : currently you can extract nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 . only the release of text into a comparative window will be supported .
warning : some editors are interpreted the pulling and add text into another program as out@@ cut and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such cases your original data might be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional ) . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path forks to a file , then let the mouse rest a while on the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . )
the three source star are the letters A , B and C . a has the colour blue , B and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , you can see at the color , which is different . if both files are different . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
in addition to the text , the column column is displayed . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding colour . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful only to see the relevant modifications . ( at C / C + + e. g. are white characters only in strings and comments , relevant for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line that separates the summar@@ ies of the text is interrupted at the places where the source file is not activated . if the line file is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines .
the results window ( below the comparative screen ) has also a info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; encoder &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains text , but often also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the Save is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( do not use buttons to find out the next conflict in order to find out the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative monsters will be used , every difference in the same conflict must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . this group will then be shown to the current group . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area , and on the left a black beam will appear on the left .
sometimes , by the automatic merge or by manual processing , no further line remains in the group ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your opinion , and perhaps again a different source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking which you might want to copy and anywhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; mer@@ ging fli@@ ppers ; however , if you copy such text from the result window , please proceed with this function .
note : if selecting the sources are igno@@ red or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
this will navigate to the keyboard and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys to the left , side , at the end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ start and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ lay column may be used in addition to the vertical frame bar by clicking also to navigation .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to do . using the insert button , you can switch between single @-@ feet and outdoor mode . ( default is the insert mode ) .
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns you synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the section ) and the ed@@ itable output window was explained ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Figure / C@@ tr@@ l picture ) , or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Image ) or to the next / previous conflict is still considered as conflict . therefore , the conflict must be distinguished between sol@@ uble and un@@ affected conflicts .
to copy the selection into the clip@@ board , you need to automatically copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . if it is enabled , you will select automatically to the clip@@ board and automatically transfer the manual copying . however , this option is careful , because you could easily over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line numbers are stored accordingly to the access operating system . UNIX variants are using a line @-@ up character \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 maintains the line file of the source files not at , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and restore the next start . ( menu In@@ sert - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a lettering with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog box also introduces variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ sive script will be displayed . if the scripture doesn &apos;t support this representation doesn &apos;t happen anything else .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be loaded automatically . on these systems the button settings are automatically an un@@ controlled color .
when this option is enabled , button key is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
when entering or return , the submission of the previous row is automatically used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to clip@@ board . the manual will be converted to clip@@ board .
you can choose which type of line type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection of the operating system .
in the same of files attempts to find &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first step , all completely identical lines can be igno@@ red in the source files . only during this step , white characters will not be igno@@ red . in this step , white characters will not be igno@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car drive &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then you could save files with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison , though they are different . if this option is enabled , the car signs must be disabled . during the merge , this option must be disabled . while default , this option is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are igno@@ red , but they will still be treated like white characters .
the default option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensi@@ vely for smaller differences . the option is activated in the default position . it is effective in complex and large files but slowly with very large files .
in automation @-@ forward mode , this setting , how long will the result of the selection will be displayed , before the next time is continuing .
automatically solves automatic all conflicts in white characters used as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) It is useful if you need this only from time to time , then use the automatic selection even conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or ignore C / C + + -@@ comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and merge with a merge . look for details below documentation to the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and an older version exists , then the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original file , if already a backup file with the Suff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts to the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to stop and re@@ boot , so the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is not available because the language is set over the control center . )
the following coefficients can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activ@@ ates this option , the top setting is used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding is a short notice that is the local code . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has for you purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this transl@@ ates as special signs and interpreted and interpreted . since the coding for each file can be individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged .
if you have a file , you can set up here which should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , you may not might work with your codec . ( e.g. , if your files can handle 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only change with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing forces .
turn this off to supp@@ ress herr@@ ing in white characters in the text or review to the text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or ignore C / C + + -@@ comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color@@ less coded over@@ lay column . but sometimes you might see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; B ; C , B &amp; B ; C ; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ saf@@ est column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen better for long lines . simply select the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
when the comparison window will be arranged next to each other or to each other . this can also be useful for advertisement of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file names for the output file as a pre@@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge , then the name of last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it is displayed first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ micro@@ processor , which corresponds to your needs . for example , you can use this function e.g. for out distur@@ bing parts or correct correc@@ ting .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command was given ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only for line @-@ processing . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds to your needs . each input row must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to enable the user to allow more flexibility when creating the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program needs , and most users would like to program that , in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the input into large letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s first text string is referring to the found text in the first cl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ few . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ ing control systems use some key words to include automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _
while you experiment with SE@@ D , you might have to understand it and perhaps you may see this regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the igno@@ red of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for line equal to appropriate . SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; each sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable matches , and every hits will be replaced by nothing but virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several conditions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of one another . example :
instead of SE@@ D , you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; . however , per@@ l only needs some details . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will maintain for display and merge . further operations change only the data that the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can only be seen .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor sees the output of the regular pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but how in each function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often program@@ mers need to process many files in a folder . from this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge .
... for every object a proposal to merge ; you can adjust the suggest@@ ion prior to the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the interaction and displays the sim@@ ulated changes to perform without they really perform ,
... leads selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F6 @-@ key ) ,
this is similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of individual files very similar . you must only open folder to the command line or dialog file .
if three folders are merged , Fol@@ ner@@ 1 is used as a basis . if no target file is specified , it uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , not to run the coll@@ ateral . to select the coll@@ ateral menu or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details will follow ) .
during the reading of the file , you will be informed of a small message window on the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files will be listed below , which were compared to then .
if the scanning of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and each folder was found during the scan , here is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually displayed . you can simply click the folder by clicking on the + / - click , or click on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys on the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions . fold the folder button with which you can open or fold all folders .
if you double click on a file , the file is started and there will be a comparative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type varies from different folders , then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such cases , the C@@ ordless hr action can not be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this species again .
as shown in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used .
with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered as identical if their whole content is identical . then also folder the same color . at folders , the age is un@@ significantly for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colours reflect the colours of a leaf that is only green , then yellow will be and later when it is old , red .
... A and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... and C identical but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a A file and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ts objects exist , the merge may not be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if a A file and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ts objects exist , the merge may not be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two folders and no explicitly enabled target file , and if the option directories are synchron@@ izing . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is to be identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : assemble and save the result in both folders . ( the user can be copied to the visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly after the merge copies &amp; the diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of merge ( un@@ securely ) activated , then investigated &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the same date will be identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such bugs cannot be removed , the merge of the folders can &apos;t be started .
during the merger , there is a file after the coll@@ ision . it shows the status column shows that when the merge was successful , and according to other reports , if something un@@ expect@@ edly occurred , you should make a final review and see if the status is everywhere in order .
if in setting up the file &apos;s comparative analysis is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will show other columns . these include the number of un@@ mon@@ ast@@ eries , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ uble conflicts will only display when three folders is compared or merged . )
you can either run the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all the coll@@ ars actions you can run together ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run the merge .
please note : if you do not have a target folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as a target , while the two @-@ folder merge function will be chosen as target and used when synchron@@ izing A and / or B as a target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed in the target file , even in the folder ru@@ sts . there are several options to avoid unnecessary surprises :
to merge all entries : select directories start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ chain ) . to merge only the current entry : select the current element or press F6 .
if due to contra@@ dic@@ tory file types still exist nor inv@@ alid actions , a message appears on the incorrect elements . you can select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options , perform sim@@ ulate and break down .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen , without the really changes . you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( together a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( please note the screenshot ) .
if you are ready with a file , select folder / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the conclusion of the list , you will see some trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting . if you want to continue to ski@@ p the cause of the problem . so you have the opportunity to select another promotion for the entry or to solve the problem in any way before you go with the merge .
if some entries were taken together , re@@ members &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and lead them not again . even if the merge has been re@@ leg@@ ged or not saved , these entries will be performed once again . only if you merge the merge promotion , these entries will be re@@ merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit onto the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree . can be entered into the element tree . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default value * . folders must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this design are not shown in the element tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a part@@ akers . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this design are not shown in the element tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a part@@ akers . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ red files that are also igno@@ red by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic files will be igno@@ red by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this file specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file can be set . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signal ) . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding place . in other file systems marks a pre@@ set point . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on .
for links to files : if the option is shut down , symbolic link is compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to the links . this is de@@ activated in default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links such as normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively sear@@ ches . ( note that it would lead to a folder loop and lead to diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es off . ) This option is shut down in default .
a full analysis of each file leads through and shows the statistics of the statistics . ( the number dissolved , un@@ mon@@ ast@@ eries , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis , and considerably slower when they do not contain files that contain no text . ( specify a corresponding Anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folder on a slow network , it may possibly be faster , only the change date and the file size will cost you a certain amount of safety . please use caution . this option is default in the default value .
similar to the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered as identical if it is equal to size . that can be useful if copying the change date . please use caution . this option is default in default .
activ@@ ating the sync mode if two folders are compared and no target folder was reported . in this mode the proposals are identical to the merger . the results from the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered un@@ certain , because it is believed that the other file does not change . ) This option is shut down in default .
if a file or folder is replaced , the original version is renamed and will replace the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file already exists , this will not only be deleted without any further backup . this option is also enabled in the default copy . this option is switched on .
normally the file merge view is visible through the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window divider with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window into the window menu and switch the window into window &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply using double @-@ click . nevertheless , you can use a single file directly into the menu . as soon as you want to run the folder , the status will be done , and the file will not run once again if you run the folder .
however , this status goes lost if you read the directory again : list -@@ menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . a few things should you notice :
a path can be relatively and .. do not contain . it is not possible with UR@@ Ls . these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then there is always a file as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to edit authorization or change@@ ment date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note : this is only possible for local files . )
the main application is currently as a differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts always the built @-@ in differences viewer . in order to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as K@@ Part is applied , it adop@@ ts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program starts to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part 3 , it is only supported the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the same of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now hot @-@ pare ) is already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already shows that it can merge the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot by what I have seen in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers that have gone to this way or let him go .
you have compiled the program compiled from the sources and configure the default pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE installed the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. , diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters varies , these lines will be treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white characters varies , the line will be treated as not identical . if it is not identical to any other , this en@@ is co@@ ach@@ able this en@@ is in the case .
the editor is stated for any difference in the files where it starts and where he ends . this important information is simply saved when the result is simply saved as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can select a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to process the larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text is suddenly laid ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text can &apos;t delete . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to come from differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . do not use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !

cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt removing ) copies into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current selection .
only differences show : files that are identical in all folders aren &apos;t appear in the folder ru@@ ction , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you have to update the folder to these options with the function Re@@ fresh . )
there are only entries to display the differences . this also shows that identical files will not be copied to the target folders . if the target file does not contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behaviour is probably replaced in a later program version . ) This option is shut down in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group at the end window ( if they are not already available ) , if the lines are already available , clicking on the button on the button .
default , this option is disabled . Under@@ differences in individual signs ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ preview of all virtual work@@ space . it is quite practical to change their current programs to work , to stop her size or move it . this works both within a desktop and with several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual work@@ spaces as well as those in the current applications . applications can be selected and even move on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and also on other working areas .
the context menu depends on it , where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu can only be opened up to two entries . if , however , the context and the name of application as well as entries will appear , maxim@@ ize , on the desktop and end . these commands are the following commands :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only if you click on an application .
the application for the selected virtual desktop . appears only if you click on an application .
if this check box is marked , window can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ space .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the name of virtual work@@ space is shown .
crossing this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ space . is it together with name Show , the names will be ordained to be ordained , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ;
if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as a small window in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; indicated otherwise only the empty work@@ space will be displayed to make their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectangle with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the main window will be determined : classic can be known as from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work@@ spaces in some other window managers are known ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual working areas in a vertical row , which is very good for the presentation side on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it will be changed in size , view the window as symbols or with their content and move . it also runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent trig@@ gering a switch ... lets the dialog appears .
at the moment , this can &apos;t be changed in the dialog for Settings : but you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c file with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or four . if you have no write permission for the file , you need to register and refer to your system administrator . in this file you will need to assign the key win@@ dow@@ transparent mode and to this value . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen magni@@ fying glass . you can enlarge it with &amp; k@@ mag . this application is interesting for different users . this application is interesting for different users . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ; this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly enlarged by new functions . it is optimized for use on performance computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ art ; launch a window as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged range of screen . in the following window will be displayed as a magni@@ fication window .. The picture that is displayed in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile L@@ upe . alternatively , you can choose a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
would you like to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter will be displayed in the enlarged window . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the form of mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default value ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can custom@@ ize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done to the following ways :
move your mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button , so you can move the contents of the magni@@ fication window and move . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you also add the &amp; Shift , press the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the select window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain , and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to insert into the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
start or stops the update of the display . the stops of the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
select the ref@@ res@@ h rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , medium , high , Very high ) . the higher response rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ads ( with the button document again in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlarge and Ver@@ less@@ er &amp; etc .
it is also known as an &amp; magni@@ fier fier ; you can use &amp; magni@@ fier satellites ; use a magni@@ fier that use a magni@@ fying glass in a newspaper or photo . this application is for different people of benefits : from search che@@ ur or artists until the web designer or see .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter for a while on the same site . it &apos;s meant to help people who suffer from RS@@ I Syndrome ( repet@@ itive strain inhibit@@ or syndrome ) and every mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , em@@ ulates a bit click on the same site . it is thought to help people suffering from the repet@@ itive strain incre@@ ment ( RS@@ I ) Syndrome and which every mouse click pain . Moreover , it can do the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which is created by clicking on the mouse , and helps to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can find pain , who are coupled with the use of your computer , you should search for a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is helping to avoid pain , which is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is possible to use due to the mouse over due to the mouse , and as with all ergonomic assistance systems : the result can vary from each other .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click once you stop the motion .
is the intelligent shi@@ fting activ@@ ist , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now you move the mouse , waiting it until the end of the motion , before the mouse button is executed . the intelligent shi@@ fting requires a little practice , but you get used quickly .
this re@@ tention time must be extended after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be out a mouse click .
if the button is switched on , the turn@@ out time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time will be set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset . after shut@@ down the mouse button , before it leaves the mouse button once again , there is no evidence for mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now it is activated by mouse button . this function is activated , creates a slow motion because of left and return a double click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can reduce the response time . open the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer , which you will adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please extract the relevant documentation to figure out how you start a program automatically .
set all settings back to the values when opening the dialog . have already pushed the button on the user after the latest pressing of user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , initially with the default settings . in particular , intelligent shi@@ fting should first be switched off . if you get rid of the automatic mouse click , you may later to increase the intelligent shi@@ fting .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it necessary to decrease the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds too .
first , you should make aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which doesn &apos;t show a link . you can use the mouse on such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse is printed , you should clean your mouse . this is usually fairly simple . the trick is that you are not only clean the mouse , but also the rolls that are in contact with the mouse sphere .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as it happens , can be different from mouse to mouse , but it should be quickly clear if you see the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and pollution can easily scra@@ pe off with a flat blade or the barrel .
in very rare situations , the operating system run by &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , when it was just an im@@ aging process began . if you use the intelligent shi@@ fting , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean any longer by pressing the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists that you have a mouse click . this is reset to the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will continue to execute m@@ ous@@ click and put the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to make it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of your desktop , if you are unable to retri@@ eve the mouse button . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter is &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and cover lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shi@@ fting , but I don &apos;t create it to edit the text .
the intelligent shi@@ fting is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can easily move it into the clip@@ board , or to insert it into the clip@@ board , to move it into the clip@@ board , where you will probably prepare the mouse on the pressing mouse button . but there will probably be some problems once again . here are some advice about this :
use the intelligent shi@@ fting just if you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , check out text instead of the text area a mouse click , while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and again stick the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will play every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is pressing a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the intelligent shi@@ fting also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , you have to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; that should be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and are set to be correct .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , made the mouse button once the mouse poin@@ ter shortly afterwards . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I Syndrome and has prepared the atmosphere of the mouth @-@ keys pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that a certain time is waiting for a pulling step before the mouse button is let down . in this way , the pulling and departure can be carried out using the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program where the user can speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can speak to the computer for yourself . users can choose from a list with the following sentences that are to be addressed again .
on the first side of the Assistant ( left screenshot ) , enter the command that is later used for voice from text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page you can choose the standard textbook book . from the text@@ books you can often choose text pass@@ words , without having to type it . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right screen photo ) , you determine the dic@@ tionary for the word . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can also download the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dic@@ tionary , so only the words recorded in the word .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly structured and contains essentially an input field for the key@@ ing@@ ness of your phr@@ ases ( the bottom white field in screen photo ) and a bit memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you w@@ k@@ mouth , you can enter properly in the input field , you can listen to the propositions which you want to hear . each spoken proposition is attached to the storage space . you can choose from this phr@@ ases that will be addressed again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... open the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , voice and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ istic and the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service .
in the input field of the map language version , enter the command to call the language of the language . in the select section below the input field , set the character string , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box when the text is unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is given as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to voice messages from your language generator will be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this command can be found in the app@@ endix .
as first attempt , use &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first try to ad@@ mit your text to the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . if that is successful , the other settings will be igno@@ red on this page and is currently developing a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently not installed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is meaning@@ ful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selection of a text passage you determine which action through the key@@ word or by choosing a text passage in the menu passages or in the strip for text conver@@ gence .
with the selection of soy , the chosen text passage will be spoken directly and additionally inserted into the disk space . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage will be entered only into the input field .
with the second selection field , closing the processing window for text boxes , you can define whether the textbook book can be stored automatically when closing the window window .
with the selection of text boxes , the book is stored . if you select changes , the textbook book is not saved . select before saving , will be saved &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the textbook book is to be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ istic contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word . in the main window near the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dic@@ tionary . with this selection box you can choose the currently used dic@@ tionary for word .
with the buttons right on the page you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or exp@@ orting them into a file . below the list , you can set the language in the input field and select the language for the dic@@ tionary .
in order to select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ mouth ; documentation one . the frequency of the single words will simply be determined by counting the recording . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dic@@ tionary to insert just properly written words into the new dic@@ tionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks the dic@@ tion@@ aries , and how these weights are to be taken out .
with this option you will put a new , empty dic@@ tionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words automatically into the dic@@ tionary , create a dic@@ tionary with your voc@@ abul@@ ary during the time .
the main window of the window for processing text text@@ books is two @-@ divided . in the upper part , the text@@ books are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding button zel . if you have selected a textbook book , you can change its name .
actions like new text pass@@ ages or books or add selected text pass@@ words and books you can either delete information on the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a shut@@ down menu .
the order of text@@ books or text pass@@ words can be changed by pulling with the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if the input field is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the tape can be used .
the selected text is copied to clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used otherwise the selected areas of the run memory .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if the text is located in the input field , this is used otherwise the selected propositions of the default memory is used .
this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged on the reset window directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the kno@@ cked left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is attached , a narrow strip in the lower part of the main window will be displayed on the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is bl@@ ended .
this menu entry is attached to the menu entry , is displayed by default via the machining window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the kno@@ cked left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
probably , you have not entered the command for voice output not correctly or not completely opened . open the page General Settings and enter the command to language output files on the cart@@ ei@@ card language output . ( see page dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer . )
festival is a voice edition of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch is supported . the license allows to use the festival free of use and dis@@ sem@@ inated without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is believed that the festival is installed in the directory / usr / local / festival . the command to voice is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator which is written in &amp; Java ; currently he only supports the English language language . the license allows it to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and dis@@ sem@@ inated without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the directory / usr / local / fre@@ et . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option has to be turned on . ( this is the recommended example for the use of Free@@ T@@ TS ) .
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ etic in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to be added to the last sign of text , so that an additional character must be added . the full command is therefore more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT ) ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / k@@ rol@@ a / / / / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / / / / / / / / / / / / / mp@@ .@@ wav ; read@@ .@@ tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ;
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option is to be sent to default .
the language output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ continues language service to provide all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it is used to support different voice output systems .
since setting the language of the language is only available in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service to &amp; k@@ mouth .
to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service , which is installed in the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t speak with the human being able to spend text by the computer . there is a list already recorded sentences that the user can still be revi@@ ved .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not include voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer , a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need to install program disper@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
for the first start of kt@@ ops , or as long as there are no speakers . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card box will be displayed . see .
most of the T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , such as different male or female , or such that is reflected in volume or speed . you should also include several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should use at least one speaker , before you &amp; kt@@ ops , otherwise using the program speed disper@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different spokes@@ person for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several printing presses for the same printer .
if you click on the card reader the speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the box card is displayed automatically , if you start the kt@@ m@@ gr and not yet a speaker is set up .
all furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear on top in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no spokes@@ person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list below . the order of the speaker in the list is also determined its priority .
click on one of these buttons to use your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ System to apply .
choose a voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young and female voice .
if you click here , click on the new spokes@@ person on a map speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can download &amp; kt@@ ops ; already nearly use . go back to the map and check if language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; click to create text orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker set , you can download the language output system &amp; k@@ de ; click on the cartridge card reader to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this start@@ up is successful , and you can create text orders and you can read text@@ books . see . remove the markings , will be connected to K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if the ts@@ man ends , it is running &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , if the box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ops appear automatically in the system area of the Control bar , dis@@ appears once the occurr@@ ence is completed .
using buttons in this series you can start text orders , stop and record again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ clip@@ board can be read or open a text file to advance . you can also switch the speaker for a job .
click on the user or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides .
the card orders will be displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD has started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the cartridge card reader and enable language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the displayed website . check the text that should be read , and select the text that will be read in the main menu tools . after a short time the language output should start .
it is almost always sen@@ sible to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ voltage lines and other invisible brands will also be read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text . check first if &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs . then select the text that should be read and select the main menu Tools text . then the language output should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quantitative ; .
K@@ emer@@ gen@@ ds is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; you informed about the events which you determined by you . you can read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can teach you different types of messages . for example , you can notice that you will be notified if your nick@@ name comes in . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can read the I@@ RC @-@ message text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Not@@ ify , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu settings . the possible settings for the not@@ ation can be different depending on application .
filter for character strings provide a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is a good example . it is a good example . it remov@@ es the tags b@@ r and b out of the news that can send the email , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not necessary .
in fil@@ tering , text is processed before being sent to the schedule of the disper@@ sion tool . they are useful to improve language or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , a matching language and speakers or to obtain certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice synthesis and their voices .
in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program is working with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts .
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be set to all other orders and will hold these orders . if the issu@@ ance of the Screen reader is re@@ read , the orders received again will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is hot to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output from news and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application , the messages are used . while you want to read a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you straight to the room . &amp; k@@ ie ; -@@ Not@@ ices are also News .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you use by the card orders will be a text contract . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that uses text@@ books . text orders are intended for the issue longer texts that have no particular dr@@ ing@@ ness .
all four order types are processed in qu@@ eu@@ e , except for the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen @-@ reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just such a reading , this output will stop and finished .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen @-@ reag@@ ents . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text and give it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filter are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
replace character sets of a text by other text . the fixing parts can be delivered either as words or regular expres@@ sions . it will be created with pre@@ defined character strings such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better compreh@@ en@@ sible form .
&amp; XML ; re@@ formers use a X@@ SL@@ T @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format into another format . in the scope of supply &amp; kt@@ ts , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speech selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of text or dependent on the program that send the text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; for example , if you have a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . please read about it .
each of these different filter has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied for a speech output . if the filter does not determine that his rules does not exist , the text does not affect the next filter .
when a text contract , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is sent by all activated filters that have been arranged on the side down . the processing through the filters are displayed in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . is a filter not connected , it is not activated and is not used . filters will be removed from the top to the bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following entry dial@@ ogues .
for the device of character strings , you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison model . these patterns will be replaced in the text , then the text is exchanged against the corresponding spare text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose any of these names , he must only differ from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string chains in the column classification and replace it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is shown in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file up@@ loading the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text order one of the here registered languages . click on the button to show a list of languages . you can also hold multiple languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied if the text is used by one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID run programs is available with the q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers need to be sm@@ ooth@@ ed . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter it .
the filter filter filter is only applied to the text when all conditions are used with an entry in the box Di@@ ary filter . if all input fields is empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words the string filters of regular expres@@ sions used in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. The words must be limited by divi@@ den@@ ds ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing of regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call him in the dial@@ ogs add or editing as help to assemble this expres@@ sions . enter &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; re@@ formers transl@@ ate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such circumstances . but it can only be applied to well @-@ form@@ edness XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c system has to be installed on your system .
specify the path for x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
for example , you can send texts to a specific speaker that is set on a specific speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . you can define that texts by mail from a female voice are to be read . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter is looking for a spokes@@ person for the text . the speaker is sent by the speaker characteristics that select the text on &amp; kt@@ ts , and the properties that can be selected by the speaker . with the spokes@@ man filter you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is registered here , the filter is applied , if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expres@@ sions , you can call this with one click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to draw the regular print@@ out at the beginning of string chain , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
set the properties of the desired office conditions here . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements in the lowest . click on the button on the right to view the dialog button .
use these buttons to save or upload your microphone settings or delete all settings .
the Inter@@ phone filter filter is only applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ ary filter apply when you apply . you must have at least 1 condition .
the language output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , added to the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ops ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section includes a short description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface of language output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / -@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output via the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is the text of the text to read and option a language code as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start only kt@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ah@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the called language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Variable filters , but when using the module for the festival , web pages are not read .
due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able is working at all . you will also do that , if you don &apos;t need this voice to reading web pages . make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is installed and can be found via the variable P@@ AT@@ H range .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ izers , so that whole phr@@ ases may ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding is set to the correct value for the respective language . there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a character string filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thesizer , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ops ; have their own license which you can find in the corresponding documentation or on the subject websites . there are also voices that possess their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code , you can download the package including &amp; kt@@ ops ; it can be found in the folder . furthermore , you will find the source code from k@@ de@@ bit under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .

KT@@ TS works with each voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages can be un@@ fully or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , you can see the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ops ; , according to information which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disper@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want &amp; kt@@ ops ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ izers , you can use the development team in conjunction with the development team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; al @-@ disper@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source text from &amp; kt@@ ts , refer to the source text archive for k@@ de@@ , or have downloaded and install the program with the following commands :
before you are using &amp; kt@@ ops ; first , check if the disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ scriptions SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is intended to be further developed the program of the schedule on ms@@ gr@@ ille . it is said that the device can not be used directly and the SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is divided into individual propositions . the user can repeat - or ab@@ at@@ ly return , repeat the output or break off .
if an application would be an application to &amp; kt@@ ops ; for example , if you have a speaker set up an female speaker for the issue . if you want one speaker , the best matching speaker is chosen , otherwise it will automatically be the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ops , you can see a speaker .
if you click on a map speaker , click on the map or click on the list , the card holder is shown on the list . as an example , if the module &apos;s device is shown for Festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found on .
enter the path to the detailed festival program . if the path is to be found in P@@ AT@@ H , you &apos;ll need to enter the festival only .
select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting is automatically performed . generally , the Western languages are used in ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slides make noise , microphone speed and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you can not select a number of kno@@ b and displayed this grey , you don &apos;t want to select the settings of this settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ votes need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices will already be loaded faster at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD .
if this check box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have a speaker set ( or forget to click on the user ) . see .
if this check box is marked , the program window will be displayed on the starting point . otherwise , after the start only the icon m@@ gr displayed in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the window window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ah@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is a text . this makes you the opportunity to stop or change elsewhere .
here are all orders listed in the waiting version , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can select a full trip in the list , which is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not each order consists of several movements ) .
with one click on OK all the changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) , and kt@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the window window .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the cartridge card . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen @-@ reag@@ ents , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . further information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either comp@@ ile or kt@@ ops either without support for the appropriate audio module ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output is to be used , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module , select the PCM device here . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % of the double normal microphone speed . thus these settings can be applied to the program SO@@ x installed .
click on users to take advantage of the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA tools includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select default .
on this card card you can setup special actions which are always executed when the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be added to all other orders . after the issu@@ ance of the screen reader was read , the orders received again will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor will be hot to hot . a warning will keep the output from news and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
messages are the next priority . a message is subject to normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read messages . if you want &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless they welcome to enter the room .
a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the waiting time .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text contract is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card only apply for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern , there are no particular actions if this is interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ops ; K@@ emer@@ gen@@ ds messages can be read on al@@ m@@ gr and click on al@@ er@@ ts . the cart@@ ograph@@ er ticket is published .
mark this check box to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; dis@@ appoint@@ ments . if this setting is not marked , the rest of the settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads no al@@ er@@ ts .
if this setting is marked , al@@ er@@ ts are being played on which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ops ; not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can add the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when som@@ eb@@ ody mentioned your nick@@ name in a I@@ RC message .
all events , which is otherwise stated in the list will be igno@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts ; igno@@ red .
use this selection field to determine what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do if an event meets you . you have the following selection options :
if you select user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the properties of the desired office . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , which is listed in the list on the box card as the top entry . see also here .
note that there are three levels for events . if the action is specified for a specific application . otherwise , the action will run for all other events of the specific application . as the last possibility the action to carry down under standard ( all other events ) was specified .
the event all noti@@ fications for the application ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the previous er@@ al@@ er@@ ts as follows :
use the button to save the settings for the al@@ er@@ ts in a file . you &apos;ll use the button to download the stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click on del@@ eting . all entries except all the dis@@ appoint@@ ments will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice of voices , the speaking speed , the volume of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the language of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently support and kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as it is the standard voice , used in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; then SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and sat@@ in cross @-@ border filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . this enables the first set to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text contract . thus , you can also stop or withdraw the whole text order . thus , it is not directly supported on the map card if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you can see the pro@@ positi@@ onal filter filter . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , it will be automatically set up as a set of sat@@ in @-@ border filters , but you can change its settings or more sat@@ in cross @-@ borders filter , but it is not recommended .
the easiest option to check the device selection by way . switch on the card selection , which speakers &amp; kt@@ ts . switch on the card selection again , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker has changed . of course you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the reading , since only the first set can be processed and not the whole text block which can last very long ,
you can then remove text orders on the card holder or cancel , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal sat@@ in cross @-@ border filters will automatically be set if you can &apos;t go down to the first time . do not change anything to this filter , unless you know what you do .
compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the proposition limits . note that the standard sat@@ in cross @-@ border filters are attached to the character .
S@@ BD filter will never be applied on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ v ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen @-@ reag@@ ents .
if you are removed from Ver@@ see the normal movement filter filter , you can insert this again by using the file _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
on the card interface selection you can write the microphone settings for application . the map card is displayed if
use of the standard speakers ( the top on the card speaker ) . with other words , no speaking characteristics are specified .
use of the matching speaker , which has all the properties of a set of speakers . if you choose to delete or edit the settings of the speaker . otherwise it cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker from , who initially meets the original properties .
select the method for entering the desired office properties by clicking on one of the select buttons .
select the properties of the desired office . if this feature does not play an role , don &apos;t give it a matter .
check this check box when the property requires priority prior to other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor when standing , this property is always treated as the primary feature . if you want to specify this feature , if you may want to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you want to specify a specific application in another language than that of the environment .
to use all the properties in the field of speakers , which matches the following commands , click on the select button , then click on the speaker , which corresponds to the following figure .
in this case , 0 for the last text reservation in the waiting time . you can also specify a order number . ( without the order number , input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ops failed immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get back support .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is stuck together and it was finished ; probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , possibly a non @-@ compatible version of g@@ amer installed . you can try to upgrade or un@@ install .
the audio output of AL@@ SA works not , if I play simultaneously with another application music . if I hold a text contract , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ops ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; a message appears to open : - to open PCM .

I have an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use them in festival but kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr indicates that voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / kt@@ int / kt@@ int / Vos@@ ges the new voice added . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; if you have found the voice to the developers .
on the cart@@ ei@@ card Audio is there a setting speed . thus it works , the program SO@@ x installed and via the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H to be installed . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ able module like the Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the microphone speed will be igno@@ red when it reads &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; it is possible to activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are quite cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .x@@ ls@@ bad file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ control filter , and set the microphone speed up .
I don &apos;t create your web pages with a female voice . I established a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads pages with a male voice .
at the Festival of 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . that Festival does not produce errors , the X@@ SL file to convert from SS@@ ML to S@@ but the gender @-@ tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE @-@ tags .
I added a custom string filter filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sat@@ in or return . on the ant@@ it@@ re@@ iter orders will be displayed , the order consists of only one proposition . what do I do wrong ?

the audio program SO@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the microphone speed , but otherwise not necessarily . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ x using the command ap@@ t @-@ get install SO@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; as a cam@@ ball ( with t@@ ar @-@ packed archive ) , report itself as normal user and un@@ pack the Tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 is the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least be created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer are created by default . some of them have a runtime dependent of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the column @-@ option shows the switch parameters , which causes the transfer of adjustment .
as a default , &amp; kt@@ ops ; in / op@@ t / k@@ de@@ 3 is installed . if this folder is not specified in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination .

before you are using &amp; kt@@ ops ; first , check if your language syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have with the syn@@ thesizer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions which are supplied with festival . want to read websites before you need to install ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German voices will be subject to limitations .
this voice sets a festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian votes , you need to enter the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding such as CO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in &amp; Linux ; Distri@@ bu@@ ckets include the first to the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ illi@@ c option , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; then the festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ik@@ os analysis and &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; this is generated by the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; the program and the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; the votes can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; generated language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this slide . it produces this by &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; it will produce those of &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; the required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
in this process , additional W@@ ra@@ pper code added to the festival is added to use &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ votes for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ Stim@@ ulus files are not installed , but in the file festival / lib / . instructions can be found under

Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ ed voice syn@@ thesizer , which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. , you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust the pitch , volume even speaking speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
best use a command to send the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wav ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ controller center ; that allows management of network interfaces , the routine and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting from K Menu k@@ control@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; c@@ controller center ; create areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings can be displayed in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the control@@ l@@ able center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ bit ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must have already fully functional and configured , that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed for installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and furnished . network devices later added , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , corresponding to the kernel version :
the network settings will be loaded when the network settings will be selected automatically , when the network settings can be selected automatically . starting with the module network settings this system automatically tries to detect the system on the system .
if the platform is not recognized , the right choice is offered . it is the platform from the list , select the distribution and the release of the best . by marking the attitude Not yet again , the definition of the network settings can be set automatically pre@@ set .
changing the network settings can only be displayed in system management mode . before , all options are displayed , changing settings are not possible . in the system management mode you will be able to verify the button mode at the right end of the module . it is the input of the password required .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the rider network interfaces can be performed :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be addressed by selecting the desired device in the list and pressing the kno@@ b interface ... in the dialog box .
by default only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button to view the dialog with further possibilities .
in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are collected by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP servers . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings will be required for every system start , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the select list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection Manu@@ ally can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ network mask is fixed .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alize the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization does not want to be activated , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict with ping in the &amp; console ; you can notice whether the requested address is already being used . in doubt the network administrators should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . insertion of an inserted network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off . switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
specifies the IP address of the computer in local sub@@ net , which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface has to be selected to the network where the gateway computer is set to be selected .
a host with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address . that &apos;s necessary because computers can understand only IP addresses . if the computer does only understand IP addresses . if the computer uses ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org . if the computer is called ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org . if the computer is called ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org . if the computer supports this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name @-@ resolution part of the rider &apos;s name allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be up or down in the list with buttons or down in the priority .
by pressing the button adding ... from the group computer to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . the new name of the name will be added .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button adding . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group of hosts on the name resolution select one entry and then click on the button .... It will edit the dialog box .
the list of known hosts describes computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address data for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily associated with bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks can replace DNS server .
normally the list of well @-@ known hosts contains some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . these are still a new version of IP shall be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... The New Testament dialog will appear .
to enter the names of the known computer and add the button to add . if the known computer has several alias name , add button adding several times and enter the other also known as names .
select one entry of a well known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog will edit your computer .
there may be one of the following tasks , then with clicking on the static host@@ s will be updated .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graphical surface like a package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but also the development tools are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic networks are given in the second , all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; alter@@ able configuration files will be discussed .
this area can not replace more information on IP networks . in this section only basic information about the integration of the PC is medi@@ ated in a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . &quot; 5 never has large spread . of IPv6 it is expected that it focuses in the near future . this description is therefore focused on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to assign a valid IP address , or if available , the IP address can not be chosen as desired !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address accounts with the global ( internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore it is possible to use any use .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting up a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , the addresses are used in the field of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is sufficient for networks up to 250 hosts large enough .
in addition , the mask mask will usually be on 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all the computers are on the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for IP address .
the network address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically altered by DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in the event of active DSL connections to find another content as specified there .
for &amp; SuSE ; is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ perf@@ config ( as expected ) as expected .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a safe program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a question for t@@ ar , sel@@ ing my wife : how much longer does it take ? how much longer does it take ?
before a band can be used , it must be created by &amp; dat ; it can be done on three ways :
&amp; dat ; sp@@ ult the band back and read the pre@@ st@@ ressing of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the occurr@@ ences of the band will not be asked if the band is being format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; dat ; the sp@@ ann , search for the suitable index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the belt index is to be created .
if everything goes smooth , the symbol is changing to the tape drive to indicate that the band is connected . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the band .
prior to the exp@@ ulsion of the tape , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to be able to do this :
&amp; dat ; announces by a change of symbol for the tape , that the integration of the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message to the tape . the tape can now be cast out without any risk .
before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat may be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; it has to be format@@ ted .
a band@@ age must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not have to be format@@ ted on the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not have to be format@@ ted before using the volume of &amp; k@@ dat ; it usually needs to be format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; it usually doesn &apos;t require a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape , D@@ AT drives .
after entering the band called and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all the data on the band are lost ! after completion of the volume process the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the desired files that can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in a local file tree . only this file or the folder is secured .
select a f@@ isher profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a bun@@ ches . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click on the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog for Settings is open . in this dialogue , you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears to backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives on record for the drive . only the selected file or the folder was checked .
select the files in one of the archives on record for the band with a bun@@ ks . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry DU@@ T ....
once the test procedure was started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog you can review and review the job folder for review .
when you have confirmed the settings of review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of testing process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can open the re @-@ manufacture , the files you need to be recovered , this can be selected in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the record &apos;s tape . only the selected file or sub@@ folders is restored .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a bun@@ ks . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are recovered .
with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the menu Recover ....
once the restore process started , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialogue , you can check your selection once again and modify the work folder for restoration .
when you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog shows the progress of recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can also download the index on two types of the band :
in this way , a safety profile is created with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a f@@ use profile :
the current job folder where the backup should be done . the list of secured files will be updated automatically according to the selected work folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , only those files are saved on the same file system , as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be downloaded separately under the backup file . each entry is considered independently from the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last in@@ incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be saved , which has changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup has been used .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes that all files will be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; ; and lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of compilation of this documentation .
you can set the settings regarding the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be carried out :
the complete path for the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must be transferred to the non @-@ winding variant of the belt device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the band is connected to the drive , the command will load to the drive . in some drives it is necessary to run read or write operations .
the option is switched on , tries &amp; dat ; to lock the design of the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work on all band drives .
if the option is switched on , when soldering the connection of &amp; k@@ dat ; the band is automatically cast out . use this option not for floppy streaming .
is the option switched on , tries &amp; dat ; the hardware block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to stop &amp; dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only be a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is set as follows :
( N byte ) The band ID . the format of this sequence is host name : seconds , whereby the host name is the name of the system is being format@@ ted on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds , which has passed since the ep@@ och in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar archives that can directly manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work as long as it is not around incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup association . this symbol is only active if a band is mounted .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is not suitable for in@@ experienced users where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; experienced users with quick access to information about problems related to their server .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information on your system or where the system is stored on the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ log log ; experienced users get quick access to the example of information on your server . &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; therefore , some extended features will be filtered and evaluated with the help of the protocol files on certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; a number of useful features . these include :
support for many different types of protocols , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included , and will be explained in the other chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; features available to easily filters and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily and sort the individual possibilities for s@@ orting and fil@@ tering in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after the start tries &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; initially the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be displayed , so you will not run with system administrator right . the protocol files will usually take under Linux usually in the file / var / log , for the normal user usually no just@@ ification for reading .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a limited range of crit@@ erion or according to the filters . in the default setting the select box will be displayed next to the filters all . then a protocol line will only be displayed , if in one of the columns contain the character string of the filter search term .
you can also select another entry in this place . the string of the filter search term is then displayed only with the entries in the specified column . choose the column process and enter it on the name of a process , so it shows &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; all protocol lines , which have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous colour as protocol lines of the level note . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched to setup dialog .
would you only want to display certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can check the process identification ( P@@ ID ) if you want to examine the output of a specific command as for example to start the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use filter bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / ks@@ ss@@ .@@ Forum @-@ sof@@ tw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g D@@ ort you will find further information about the source of supply &amp; ks@@ ellers log ;
&amp; ks@@ c log ; also in the following folders of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Arch@@ iv@@ s : boot log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section takes a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for control the program start at the up@@ drive of the system in the &amp; Linux ; it is therefore because it is easier to use , more powerful , and even more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I &apos;m not going to go further on historical aspects ( among others , because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ aries is below / s@@ am and not under / etc .. This is therefore important because someone could try out a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and new format . that is why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was there one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it differs from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc will be directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole set of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service , which you want to start at the high level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . , system services do not include such items such as set@@ serial that is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie down under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for this file , even if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the standard volume level is listed in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should start a line like the following :
at this point you can disc@@ ard a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre @-@ set run@@ level 3 is necessary . if you want to change that , then you can change / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand . if you have something wrong , then you will repair it by changing the system and execute the following :
but how does it start now all the real scripts ? if you are using -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder no correct files are located . instead , each entry is here a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start this script in the command line as follows :
this would keep the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K includes , the script will be called by the argument . if it includes a S , the script will be called using the argument .
some people wish to create a simple way , machines for many purposes . I could run &amp; eg ; a server running level , that can run only ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; ship@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . furthermore , I could also have a user level , das &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program has been created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to say to say tri@@ vial : simply drag one entry from the range of availability services to one of the six round level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within a level by changing it anywhere else . this will only be removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens only if they draw a entry from the availability of availability .
note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed if you simply drag them to a new run@@ level , you need to select copy from the menu pane or from the context menu and then add to the target range - even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the s@@ orting number of an entry can sometimes be calculated . in such case you need to edit the s@@ orting numbers of the environments before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the paper basket . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the various work@@ areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection or below the previous .
to move an entry into another round level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired level level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to manually change the s@@ orting number or the name of a single entry , press the tab button to switch between different fields . do not use the dialog through pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I did with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eling , and now the machine starts continuously . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level on a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under round level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the species , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for propri@@ etary operations in distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are required , which are required from the respective system service ( and even if they are located in the right folder ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) are simply complete without message when their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send us information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation by &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you have to save them . either use the respective icon of the tool bar or the entry to save in the menu File .
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group@@ ies . to do the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the user or group properties .
some cart@@ ograph@@ s can only be displayed if you have enlarged system settings . only if you can create individual settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , you will appear on the individual settings , if you are either Shadow pass@@ words , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
the box card password management appears , if you are Shadow pass@@ words , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
this card card may only be activated and initi@@ alized for at least one file system limit ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , whereby the maximum limit of data in KB are :
these parameters can be selected individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field file system file system .
the card groups informs about the users of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field of primary group . furthermore , users can become a member in other groups by using this in the big field .
the Dialogue Properties dialog contains a list of users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , choose from the menu users or group or click on the suitable folder button of tool@@ bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works analogue .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , modify , change and more .
