<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found on the same place. if you're going to organize plenty of photos in one year. if you will have enough photos will then use folders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then you will then use a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, working runs, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will not be able to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stack processing simple. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies the backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend you to save the metadata option in the installation page of the metadata into & digiplug. if you forgot that Exif- and IPTC data can be written in the file, then you can then add the metadata from the database to the files by clicking the corresponding item.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change that? to them & digiplug. them introduces a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, the real work, since you should now choose any photo. of course you can select all the images that the same attribute need and then set the value. this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now learn with keywords, keywords, such as you are frequently called in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you are cataloged images from another source with built-in texts, then it will add the tree to the right place. the sorting of the Hierarchy within the building is no problem and can simply be done by pressing a subtree to another. the changed passwords are pursued by & digious; updated while the undertrees are persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows like different metadata. this is a very rough representation since each block consists of metadata in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are the characteristics of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments on the third important tool to catalogise your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to see most of your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, others photographers and agencies. they are safe to interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer, then catch some details to see people, the square.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. Wow! it starts to dream, associations, the historical period is again present, you may perhaps even hear the silence. the label therefore has changed their perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other photos, the title may possibly be more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you should show images you should tell a story, the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him to help you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is OK if a picture is not perfect if the strength has only work with a labelling for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digious, you can also save a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), then you can tell you for a selection of images. if you want to export your images in Web galleries. you'll need to tell you the story of the Web-Galeriesystems. so you have to tell the story about the opening hours a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it Earth not a boring Planet in front of Google Earth? good, because with images the train of the spatial presentation now runs with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of geolocalization are already innumbar and will be able to repeat yourself in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can also export your journeys with geographical data. you can also download the photos at the shooting location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc. you can also export Google Earth viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also applicable in all changed versions, so also for the work of other.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setting page of & digiplug was taken; as information shall be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (Synonym for Erer and Writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographer. if it is not wished to protect the name of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. after that this value has been stored, it should not be changed anymore. this field does not support Commas as a partakers.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (Synonym for author): linked to the author. examples: this field contains the work drawing of the photographer. examples of this field can be as: employee photographer, freelancer photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merk to the authority of the author, this field has to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (Synonym for provider): use the Anbideterfeld to identify the picture. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here. if the image has a storage photo, then the group / Agency will offer the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this has no protection against misuse. everyone who has no protection against misuse, or change it. the solution for this problem is digital watermarks. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and Halb professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in a picture. & digiplug came; is available in the near future a module for the stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record mistake, plate failure, ECC, transfer errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desperation, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we're not talking about CDs that have lost on the street or fire. these kind of losses are the same that you may also happen with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we are about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data restored company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem in CDs / DVDs, these must have been treated for you longer than a few years. of course you can claim hard CDs and DVDs to archive quality. there are offers of Gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. if you believe it lies in your excitement space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can easily be readable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good Disks and good recording devices. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. it turns out therefore to choose the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to protect themselves. therefore they use a control mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for the formatting and the control sums. despite this massive protective cover they are needed by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there's a convenient program named IsoBuster, it is running under Windows and Linux; but is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications for damaged disks of damaged disks, hard disks, Flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to save the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that is spoken to CDs and DVDs was of course also applicable to the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good capture device to high quality media in a non-quality media. if you want to check the media with a description, date & author label and afterwards protected site. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before using the latest hardware and software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppy manufacturers reserve your statistics for itself. their manufacturer guarantee a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanism of hard drives: dismissal</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disco hold on the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. for lower temperature applications, SMART can not notice this error. some of SMART introduced the immediate rectification. these are particularly readiness and relocation. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just around the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also use data loss due to a current output before using the files, but these losses may normally produce without big problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices does not comprise much, these can take severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause serious damage, hardware and other defects. protect themselves before the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most widespread protection against power peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that a part of the energy storage is absorbed and the rest erdet. however, it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. however, remember that not each plug-in strip contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it provides the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to protect the protection against flashes and therefore the right connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since there is an overvoltage on your computer, you should consider that also all peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers represent overvoltage support which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for coaxial cable of cable modems and television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specifically designed for laptops and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection your system will protect your system before smaller fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of unbearable data. it may be meaningful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overlashings, these devices can automatically deliver up to the power. some models allow you to run up until the electricity runs again. if you have a UPS, you should be sure that they are the same quality standards like an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time of battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is suspended and compare his security against prevention of this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you think it is good. at the end you should always remember any cable to trenne before going into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use this as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as the backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that you can store any quantities of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">In comparison to the hard drives, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. furthermore, you have to send data on the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore just as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is no general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services available on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution online. the professional variant provides you more in full resolution online. for $25 a year you will receive unlimited memory, which should be reviewed only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From sight of data backup the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically included with the TCP protocol automatically and with the large firms are included in the offer a backup and a partial memory. thus they are desasterful.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrate the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are andue for transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says when this occurred to you. all these disorders remain undiscovered until you should have no protection in your computer. no one seems to have no protection for it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data away than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Inreliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss because they generate interferences within the data streams. these errors remains unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not affected by transfers problems, you should look at the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon for & Linux; and Windows available soon. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrinal file system. it is still in the Alpha status. it is still using the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% at the workplace systems. for notebooks, the proportion of thieves is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the most common damage. it is currently limited to a lower damage as e.g. theft or reinstallations. Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; there was no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. a very good English articles will be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of pre-examination during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the largest threat for digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 stops of fundamental physical borders. this means that technology is further developed for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixels sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and a high-quality look, the Optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you require a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or greater formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive will be able to use today for 100 & euro; so do not require any data loss for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected in every year of any data loss. thus secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do something like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of records, or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash will have you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroys a lot. forget flight accident: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually affect an entire room or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hence Desastervorce does not mean any local storage. bring your backups up the stairs into the neighbouring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as above is already a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files will be secured. it is a snapshot without histie and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete guarantee. generates a complete momentary snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the final differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: one backup of the files have been changed since the last backup. this creates a number of momentary status to any time. this securing comes to a versioning system at the next one with the exception that it is only abgeted and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that allows you to easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transcripts copied rsync only the difference of files that really been changed. this happens and if you want to increase the security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you plenty of time to discover losses and restore. at the same time you will get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly rate recording for at least one month and a moment of momentary intake for every month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, storage, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures can survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable everything is said to be unpredictable during the period. unfortunately, there is no other way to date when the current system are backwards compatible. the fewer variants you have in the past, the more lightweight is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is today available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to reading your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay at open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. it is always increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have plans to enlarge the scalability and the area you want to increase on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this section and put it to a new plate:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg command if your new record was detected by the system, but don't depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC (source is / dev / SDC); parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; Size of the plate in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; resize2fs / dev / corc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create these self. this task is easier by year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that vanishes slowly from the market. therefore you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was to replace as an open source standard, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can save gamma- and chromatiity data for an improved color information, but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression data. this format we want to save you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. it can be saved in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm. a problem is however, that this format has been adapted to many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed-free and open source image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors in Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why to replace its XML-based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platforms;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is an overview of XML and RDF. the file information will be associated with enlargement & quot; .xmpquot; saved the XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it before a original recording, mostly in the raw format, as it saves the metadata separately from the image file and how to notice the raw format is missing. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that support a large area of application purposes and business models. among the activities of DCMI, work on an architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarifying efforts to achieve an extended acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures of the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures on the camera system, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your own archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For an enemy processing you can use external programs. if you get the pictures back with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut apart from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the machined images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export it only in Webgaleries, add in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into & digiplug. in the section adding a photo to an album you can add a description as you can already have on your hard drive, but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your album bench.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, use this with the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it up. another description you will find in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. when the connection is made, a distance indicator will appear at the bottom and the intrugs of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not appear. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for each file, photos, movies, music etc on the camera will appear.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information on any entry. with the side panels and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of one entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer. note that for some digital cameras don't have all information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata like EXIF, manufacturer, manufacturer, GPS etc. this information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digiplug. please note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer. download all photos from their camera to one record in & digiplug. when downloading photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to download the pictures from the camera before you want to delete photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you want to download all photos, you can only select the desired selection methods of & kde; as soon as you have selected the photos, use the button to download and then selected box. download the selected button as long as you can choose some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera is supported, an option is available to download. these pictures were not available until now. in this case, the new pictures are available with a star in advance window. if you select this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download the buttons All Download or selected, a dialog appears to be taken into the photos below. the list of existing albums are sorted as normal folder, displayed in the section My albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After that you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug. loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete all of the camera by clicking the delete Delete. if you want to delete Delete, you must select this first and delete Delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore the photos which you want to delete from the camera. if you want to clear whether the photos will be saved in a & digiplug; if you want to delete all the photos into a & digiplug, if you want to delete all the camera than the camera, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not especially meaningful, after the photos taken from the camera. this may be meaningful if you upload photos of various recording types into the same album. therefore, it can be meaningful, the date and time, to integrate the image to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the picture and for date-based substrates. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options While the transmission will open three additional options, which will be carried out before the photos stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another file format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. switch on this option to read the help of the command-time command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the option of camera file names, you have the possibility to change the file names in lowercase. or in case letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new record, which & digiplug was used; for a photo is used below the name, the camera is stored in the preview. its settings are stored and automatically used when you can open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digious, you can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation during shutting. not all cameras represent these information. in the section side bar metadata you can read more details about the information which has embedded your camera in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and when your camera does not deliver this information, the photo in the original orientation. if you want the automatic turn off, use the knob and select the Automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera has been taken on the photo, where the photo was made available, it can be downloaded and digiplug. all images with the same date are loaded automatically under the picture gallery. all the images with the same date will be downloaded in the same site. not all cameras make this information available. in the Section Side Bar Meta Data, you can read that information can be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off and in this case you store & digiplug. if you want to change this option, you will need to switch this option. use the button Extended and select the date based subtract at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their computer to the camera is button 1. select the file selection dialog & kde; you can choose to select the file uploaded. you can also select more than a file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection is done, asks & digiplug. you can where the pictures will be loaded up. a file selection dialog for the camera is released. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, a position is meant to be displayed in length and latitude. the identification of data can be performed from the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photo photographers, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic place. not everyone uses a plane to insert a territory through automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten exactly the photo, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digious, users can easily assign to the location of the photos so it's good to document the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data in the picture? first you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the data into this fields? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a reprocessing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical mapping (manual) and last via the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera, which has a GPS unit. but there is a few that work together with GPS receivers. either as a map module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, they must store these data in the GPX format because this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract the data of images and from GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude grade or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the number of characters used to create maps.google e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digious was tried to give you much control of its operations as possible. there are many settings that access the behaviour of & digiplug. set up on these settings, you need to change in eight pages. you can switch between these settings, click on the symbols of the left hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Action can select on entry-up preview or start photo editing. set the standard behaviour of & digiplug; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard didacity and urgent data. these data will be selected automatically in the corresponding IPTC data areas, when the option is synchronized to the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for author of the photographer: this field should be the professional name of the photographer. this can be denominations such as described photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the car, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for provider: use this field to indicate the photo. this must not be the author, if this has been registered for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then the picture should be entered here. if the image has a storage photo, then the group or agency will be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data into the corresponding IPTC rim. this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only available in the database of & digiplug. these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into & digious; imported without losing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image readings as embedded labelling (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you can add to your photos and you can also read from other images. attention: in pictures, who already contain guillings, these are overwritten by & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse rests in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digious; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats; trying to add the file extensions to this list and remove any file in one & digiplug. album folders that has no such expansions, from & digious; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can return the default settings by pressing the button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the fluorescent of & digiplug; can be opened on this page on the default values. however, some pictures have turned on this page. however, some pictures and the synchrone mode is not available. if you have one, then you can only get on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can switch this here. you can switch the tool bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Overexposed and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the photo processing this picture can be switched on with F10 and F11 and switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, the images in a higher resolution of the luminance can be coded as in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the immediate explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the adjustment PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation reduces image quality, since PNG uses a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. meaning 1: a low and 9 compression mode.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files you can compress the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this decreases the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality as the deflate algorithm is free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting loss free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss free. even if you have written the loss of loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digious, image processing is only a picture viewer for photos. currently, the image processing has been developed very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default increase is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option if you use this option to solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option shows the picture a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 Gittering pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white button is used to use the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white-off is not set. standard is a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors have the effect that exposed images in four steps more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top light, so the parts of your images are to catch the top white in the settings. using the attitude of your camera, it produces some unusual results since it shows the top lights in various roatches. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the slantern.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red. & dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the possibility to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1. however, this may also be made later in the Image options of & digious; this can be too small in order to keep the time for DemosaValve, you should be able to proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the color-filtered image sensor that provides many cameras and is known for a matrix-coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digipw; and Dcraw represent three alternatives to offer: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was used for me and that used by me. VNG interpolation (variable number of gradient) was also interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as it is performed during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions such as these are given back. there are also LCMS and & digiplug. information like the colour information from a colour space in the other are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Keyboard Behavior if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Colour profile folder Sinsert here the folders such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .Color / ICC, where you save all your profiles. & digiplug. examined this folder then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles, you have the possibility & quot; standard supply; to be paid for your profile. everything can be changed when opening the shell file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative opposite Xcalib or Arguments. here only your pictures are not managed by the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should adapt to the camera manufacturer and model that you can use. not all profiles are created on the same type. there are some, such as Canon, which do not have a color chart or Gammacorrection. this means that you don't need to carry the color mapping.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-proof-profile, with which you can emulate, as your printer can be readily available, as your printer comes with a smaller color range as your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated. this might be manually correct instead of leaving your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most of the cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, a table of cameras and profiles should be fit together here. this response is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion allows the style to recognize: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Neutral, P for portraits and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & kde; picture lights and image processing is supported; many modules support which have been written to support with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. choose which you want to use and these are then loaded by & digious; these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will find some in the context menu of the front.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugin .org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diedau should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjustment the time between the imaginations, usually are 4-5 seconds good. the other checkboxes switch the metadata or the screen ends at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics show on the left side a list of all the cameras supported. if you want to use a camera that is connected to the computer, switched on and in the image display mode, you have to make sure that the port settings are wired, USB and USB / FireWire Mass memory.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the lower end you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage camera. this field is only active if you have a USB or FireWire-mass storage camera from the camera. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / bit, specify on which you hang on your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, you need to connect the camera to your computer and turn it into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digious came; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set Camamodell and Port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this will be displayed in the menu Cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the dialog dialog for the move of &gt; Pictures in trashsander, you can set the conversation of & digiplug. in deleting a photos in an album. in the sections of a photos and delete a album you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down by & digious; if you use the option to use in the right side bar without feedback. otherwise, you must use the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also use the display of the welcome screen of & digiplug. starting at start, this will accelerate the start-up of & digiplug under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting at the start of new photos are searching for new photos and search for the basis of new or deleted albums / photos. if something from the base folder was deleted, ask & digious, you know if it is to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different colour schemas can be used in & digious, to fit the main window to your taste. this settings can select below settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be recorded below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digiplug, you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digious; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and to correction and improvement. the image processing can be started with a click with the left mouse button on a preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of details.</seg>
<seg id="338">The photo processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug. there are therefore no part of your distribution. further information on the KIPI modules can be found in the section editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current record number, magnification factor and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the upper edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of the photo editing change your photos. however, the original photo will change before you have used the original photo, before you can store the original photo not more, once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should therefore make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file saving as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you don't have the photo, you can re-produce the original image from the menu file reproduce, or the button The button reproduce in the toolbar. you lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any promotion of image processing can be reproduced or reproduced. the last action can be remodeled by using processing, reproduced or restore processing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this frequently, you should see the shortcut, Ctrl; -z to the reverse and to restore Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you choose the & LMB; in the tool bar or restore button in the tool bar you can press a moment longer, you get a context menu. if you choose one of the menu entries, all the actions are made between also reverse or reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you started the photo processing, you can move between photos in the same album or same keyword by using the navigation device in the toolbar, picture height, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can walk in the photo and zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the check-out menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Saver displays the photo in full screen mode. if you don't want to use the Esc button. if you don't want this, you can change this in the setup dialog of & digiplug. if you do not want this, you can call this from & digiplug. view the window to setup the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image you can print in the menu file image and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo here.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu allows you to print individual images or whole sentences. you must select only the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer. if you follow the assistant, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiplug came; main window has a side bar at the right edge, which is available for important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation plate, also available in image processing. it will be displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same rider, the sidebar leaves disappear and disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view you can enter or insert the note down. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to be copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated and special characters are converted into other applications. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should notice these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented it, you can either use the button user or switch to the next picture that will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button there is a button. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, this will always be done if you select a metadata setting that is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluates a valuation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorter. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard abbreviation Ctrl + 0... 5. to rate several images simultaneously, select this and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment will be written in the IPTC field, which follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the previously shown in this & digiplug. session attached files.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is adapted to the entered search word. you can restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief during the input of keywords in a picture series. if you have different keywords, these are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords will be saved in the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">When several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar Keyword filters will be used to change the selection of the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - data, keyword and search options. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the cut quantity of these two are displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drain. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag them out of the right side bar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears whether you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is reduced to no matter what the amount is reduced to three images. they were drawn up with Ctrl + a and then put a keyword from the right keyword tree to the selection and put it down there. a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place with any start of the program. it can also be switched on settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or to be, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control range.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, according to the database is sought. this may be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set a wide search of all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options are as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial has been written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I've got it mainly on & digiplug; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one is using a colorless workflow, you can reach the colors of your camera or scanned colours. using a colourless workflow, you can reach the colors on your monitor using your camera or scanners, and select the colors that you will print or in the web from your digital darkchamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes on color management, then everyone wants to express what buttons must be available for the results. unfortunately, the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you sufficient background information about color management. additionally, you should make your own informal decisions to make your own informal decisions to get the desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows meets all six criteria listed below, you must not take care of colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You can work on a monitor that is calibrated on the RGB color space. (more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your single other educational issues are per e-mail or web, where the RGB-facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if this RGB works well and makes life for all so easy, why should one use another colour space and make thoughts on color waste?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limiting from RGB compared to the colors we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see the hufeisenche region, and the colours in the RGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB using some larger farms, visit Bruce Lindblooms page and then click on info and then click on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to get my monitor, if I have decided to work only in the RGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the RGB color space, or not, you need to work your monitor. if you work as a RGB's color space, then you need to use either a monitor on the RGB standard, you need to use either a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections to improve the image in most cases. use it as you try to try further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalizing, same, automation and contrast expand from the menu correct Automatic correction, try to make the best of your colours. you will have to experiment with these effects to see what works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize the method: this method is scaled using the entire picture, so the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">This method is adjusted to the luminary of the colours of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity than as flat as possible. sometimes, the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes produces it only trash. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles with a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjustable the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by one of the lowest and highest values of all values in between. this is only visible when balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off of & digiplug was a semi-automated tool to perform the white comparison of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is slightly restricted to a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you're working too far from the original picture, if you can perform the white mode in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction are better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white algorithm of the copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it over the menu entry colors white in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side are adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will be adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original box, then it is enough to click on the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels below this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram indicated that you will change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in good illuminated images, most pixel very small Luminants. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum will be called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow is adjustable, you can improve the shadow details of your photos or down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then click on the picture preview for calculating the color temperature of white wine. on this type, the temperature and green values are automatically set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the white comparison with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The surplus-dictator increases the colours if more than a color channel of the Pixels is exposed. this will be shown the combined result in white wine. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and shop make exactly this. any adjustment of the white, you can use this in a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button settings sets all the filter values back on their standard values and the corresponding neutral white wine. note that even neutral settings will be displayed as your original. if you want to save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the coefficients of depth per color channel of the machined image. 8-bit encoding is better suitable for high quality images. this coding requires more disk space, calculating time and stands only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool brings the same dialogue as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. a detailed guide for the use of paint profiling allows you to drag the chapter of color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under colours Tonight correction. this tool ensures that you can use several color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same error and you always need the same correction. in the manual, you can find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of exposure to correct is the tool for gradation, that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug tools; tools Farbeffective provides you four color effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar energy, also called Sabatier, also called Sabatier, and afterwards the development of the image had been inverted. this was the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted in the second lighting. this tool was a partial negatively of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar energy. at approx. 50% intensity the image is chemically possible. another increase creates a negativity that is not to create a negative image that is not possible to create a photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel. the original image is (1) and that is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it distinguishes itself from a saturation that makes it a stronger contrast effect of the colours brilliant and smooth. try it easy to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. this name is a composition of & quot; Velvias offers strong saturated colors for daylight and high contrasts. however, Velvias offers strong saturated colors, but also some photo ographers, especially those of which hardly undertake landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates Neonlight to the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the repetitions repetitions the strength of the Neonlight. in large pictures, the filter can overload the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it's not unusual that you want to correct the color console and the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu of colors. once you are satisfied with the result. once you are satisfied with the result, use the knok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a photo of bad light conditions, you can get the converted problem. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce ssaturation instead of it. if Him like the result, you can confirm your changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuchstarch / contrast / Gamma is the tool for the improvement of exposure to exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you will need to clarify the requirements of the slide. concrete is the three shooting below the histo program.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active edge as or the selected area. under the graph there are three slurks to change and which can be moved in to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the control is to move the knob and consider how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamically, based on the settings of the picture, updated. on the left side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box can be adjusted, whether the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis is widely used. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram of a single pillar is dominated. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark sounds, the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for medium sounds, commonly called Gammaths.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color tweezers can be used in a preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and bright tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the choice of manual values for each area. there are also two knobs that can be used in order to change the output values such as in the input rate. the compression of the output values can be used e.g. in the background while something else can be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values will be set automatically depending on the values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and loading: these buttons can be stored in the file system and later reloaded, which is used to use Gimp levels format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colorings, the input values will automatically be adjusted automatically for all shadows, medium and sunshades. activate the original image to use the input values of the histogram for red, green, blueprints and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposed indicators controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, the half of the original and the target image is displayed. the preview will be dynamically dependent on your settings. on the right-hand side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification of the channel: this selection box allows for the channel to be changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this cheese, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will continue.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curator according to the right, for example the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright tones are correspondent and the corresponding pixels of the pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">The preview of the original photos is a red marking. if you want to change this marking on the area you will move, a right line on the curve is displayed, which is the original value. create a point on this line and move it on and off, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and charging: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve you can generate this file system and later will be charged. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colour paste buttons automatically create the control points of the curve, medium and sunshades. activate the colour pipette you want and click the original picture to set the control points for the rotor, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">This option is controlled by overexposed pixels, to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect on the final result and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black and white photo set in the Luminanzler. shadow and sunshades was applied with the colour pette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digiplug. imaging is a tool to improve the colorducts or to change the colorings of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu colours channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and rash. the left section of the window shows you a preview of. the original can be viewed as a comparison via the own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position these in the image, a vertical line in the histogram will show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: knob for red, green and construction allow you to keep these channels even if you also activate the corresponding colour components. this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the color mixer for the generation of great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a colour is visible from the same place in color channel and their smokers can occur in each channel. if that is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion, and then reduce the fares first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer setting can therefore store and then load. the file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposed indicators controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is readjusted. the Luminance is activated. the original picture is below (1) and the illustrated picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. using the development of digital photography, black / white is a step step, because colour images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good at all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filters. this improved landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orangfilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">RotFilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic end effects and can simulate lunar conversation towards the day time. similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: this creates warm bright and medium sounds during a little cold. this is very similar to the process of a print and recovery in a Sepiatschooner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug. the tool texture may apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting, a pop portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry image texture may be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter depends on the right increases the depth of the depth and three-dimensional of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect is applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the changed underneath (2) and the parameter relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug, the tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is no easy task. a possibility of keeping its attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the streak eye. under the frame the module can be started under image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you will set the desired frame type for your picture. pierce the picture with a thin line, niepce leaves it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), it is ideal for a nice three-dimensional frame and decoratively add a decorative frame with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: is the width of the frame in percent. the value for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can add easily a formatted text into a picture at any place. this will also be available in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text, orientation, color from the colour space and the character set with its features such as you need. you will simply select the character set to the image size. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background. it is the picture finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you select for your text can be changed, until you hit the button "OK. after the image has been stored once, the text is part of the picture. it can't be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug. tool templates can use a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image stencil can be used in image processing to put templates via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For stencil, there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you must add the PNG file format and want to add with maximum compressing (9) to illustrate the file size of template. if you will simply add an e-mail in English to & digiplug. mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you will notice the template files. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder is set for stencils, a building view is displayed, which automatically reflects the folder structure of the template. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the below picture. it is centered around the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinks: this button resized the lower picture. if you want to apply template on the whole image, you need to reduce the picture according to the left mouse button. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the picture and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use the template on your picture. the image will then be adjusted automatic.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digious, three different tools are available for sharpening. each of them has preferences in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, gracious images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Infinity mask works on the contrast of the edges to leave a picture sharply. actually, it is not a bit, it works rather to remove the atmospheric Dunst, and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">The focus is possibly the best of the three, because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its use and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised pictures require a correction of the sharpness. these elements are smaller than the resolution should be turned into a common color. the same phenomenon can be seen if colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras require more tolerated sharpness than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures a camera's internal sharpening has been applied. in contrast, images in raw format must always be tightened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some Scanner require a sharpening filter already during the reading of the image. if you enable this deactivating, you get the control of your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening-value. that allows you to correct calls with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should now be careful because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but also amplify the noise. generally, you can correct your focus on the menu entry. in the focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution, the picture shows a bit soft, is much easier than it. use the tool to correct turnout and experimenting with the menu entry. the preview window on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp is a very good tool to remove sanding from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and preview can help you process. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values generate very good results and should make first be tried. an increase in the radius or amount should increase the effect. if you create the unsharpened mask will create room and create the impression of grass in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius produces as many pixels on each side of an edge through the filter. high-resolution images allow major radii. you should therefore sharpen the best images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image one of the original is added, thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a breakage from the maximum RGB-value and to apply differential amount. this means that a minimum difference is to be applied for an edge of the filters. in this way areas with a soft change between the killing of the sharpening, and therefore beauty treatments are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp filter. the original picture is the (1) and the resulting image has been applied (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious solution; tools refocused on a picture by improving the edge. it used the copyright protected outdoor filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool has tried an image about & quot; refocused approach as merely try to try the photo. it is using a technique named FIR Vienna filtering. refocus is usually achieved better results than unsharp. you can start making it from the menu by clicking colors refocus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular saw is much better than the Gauss's folding. the GIR Wiener Inverse has a very long tail, which is far from the original pixel format, which is far influenced by the FIR in most cases, even very strongly affected by the remote pixels. these causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most of the images the default value is 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharp then however on Heiligenstadt.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a correlation of correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation is reduced the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilter: an increase of the room filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value is still pollution.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. do not use this parameter if you do not use any unsharpeness filter. in most cases you should use this value to 0, to avoid annoying artifacts. if you need a value equal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value specifies the size of transformation matrix. however, the size of the transformation size may be good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular edge or the Gauss's sharpness. please note that the module is very slow if you choose a value for these parameters. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any editing parameters will be stored for later and then it can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all trimming, colour and intensity corrections on the image before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before changing the picture elsewhere. the reason for this is that much operations changes not immediately visible, but left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unblurred produces better results as sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it needs to create unsharp. even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of the unsharpeness. practically it is the result of the FIR Viennese Filters always at least as well as the sharpens mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filtering, on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour screen has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to sufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of sharpness in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator glare sets the unsharpeness of the part of the dark, to create a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinker allows a adapted color for the pupil. if you like blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non-selected artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as strong points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed values [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. if greater values are mainly homogenous regions of smooth and more sharp. a value of 0.9 should be done so that no sharpness is necessary. please note that details should always be subordinated to independency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction-dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoother evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie grains or CCD-noise, a high value of wafers will produce a high value of wager. JPEG Artefacts are best eliminated at a value nearby 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum torque factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value to the degree of noise in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Rule: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher value is set, the more will be smoothed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns as often the algorithm is running. normally, 1 or 2 are enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">[5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, it should also be small. make sure that small angle will generate a long runtime. thus, you should select this value as greatest possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel gland never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more of quality you can get through the choice of this option is low. however, it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend him out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and charging exactly this. any adjustment of image error correction can be stored in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast when working. however, it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see how picture error has been corrected with little artefacts. the module will be applied to a photo that is created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see it is an independent black Artefacts in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the travel. the original picture is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious; smoking production is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange. it uses a protected protected algorithm by Peter Stern.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool is available to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, can be removed too. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moirev; effects of injected images from books or magazines are to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this tutorial on English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo above shows a typical scene that was done with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grain noise that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, only the subwindow details and the flush-advanced settings can remain in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time indicated by the filter per pixel and can be smoothed on the picture and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller flaws were adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: checks the sharpness. this value sets the pixel pitch to adjust the filter to the front. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image can't get rid of this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter picture details can't get more and noise or dirt again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can't be the entire noise, or crack peaks. set it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controlled the luminance of the image. we recommend either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoother process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoother process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controlled the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically are stronger, however also contaminated the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Shock absorption: controlled the alignment of phasenjittering. this value is defined as fast the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear to occur. if it is on its minimum, the noise and phasenjitter may appear on the edges. it can remove jaws and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are exactly used. all parameters on the noise reduction which you have set, can be stored in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoked your life can change. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes it is a picture to crisp for your purpose. it is much easier than one image to sharpen. use tool to correct turnout and experimenting with the menu entry. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digiplug came; photo Restauration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photographs of photography.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts, film grains, scratches, scratches, scratches and local errors occur in digital, original or subsequently digitised images into image contours, making it the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and texturing. the algorithm for restoration is developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannum and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a deserted compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; arefacts; - small standards that correct the uncompressed image. this setting should be correct to correct problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and charging exactly this. any adjustment of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast when working. but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can therefore stop the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can be restored as a photo with equilateral noise. the module is used on a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can recognize the notorious film grains on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures can be applied to an old color photograph, which have been used with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts and the photo gallery below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digious tools; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixel of photos which have been used with a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are especially with high quality raw mode photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression has a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and "quot; bright pixquot; and. there is no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can discover the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark image to the correct image. a automatic processing of the dark pixels will find the bad pixel. note that the assistant remembers the last dark image and reload this automatically at the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture area and the preview can help you correct the result. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all pretext areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">In order to see a defective pixels on a preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it's an average of the neighboring pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defectives pixels in block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block, to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim), these are then used to interpolate the defectives in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are moved to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defectives in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug. the Vignettification correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e., exposed corners, a picture to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo format, you can often reduce the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) they reduce the edges and edges of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor. teleobjective demonstrate this behaviour under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="568">But also disadvantages. many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide angle lens should also use with Center Filter, an aperture of f / 16 or less, otherwise unsharpen effects appear through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filming and shades scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of an Centerfilter by an equivalents, the transformation with a Centerfilter is being applied to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the Vignettipping error correction, and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light damping at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density amounts to 2.0, or random a luminous intensity of 2, entspic.Increase the density to compensate a greater degree of Vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstarch, contrast and gamma Settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignettipping correction reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the knob provide you only positive values, as you have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more fine tuning of the exposure of the target image, then let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug. image processing from the menu Color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettification correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the visitation in the corners and (2) the correct image. a constride and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug came; Linear distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses to be correct. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool is working with geometric distortion. colour distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient is treated with the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can be correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grab has a similar visual effect, but on the edges. this correction is not applied to the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of steps corrected the remote corners to the second gradient. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general, this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the second degree. with negative values, tonnage can be corrected and positive values cissened distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion. this value will be stronger than in the middle of the picture. for most lentils the 'corners parameter has the inverted signs of the parameter of General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scalates the image size and performs a correction first gradient. negative values increase while positive on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image into the corners while positive values improve it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview the correction correction. the values are stored for your image, stored in the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or magnitude-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best perform this correction as all the first. if you have a picture re-cut and thereafter a cord-shaped correction would be the effect of the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it into a important place, such as the marine edge or building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this site. in the connection, you can correct the tons of salads with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a kissensed distortion is the resulting image of the black corners. you can remove this with the cutting tool in the menu. cut out of the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most of the pictures are the tons shaped correction. the next logical step for some designs, e.g. recordings from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective to correct the all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the follicular correction to a church in Norway. the original picture is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-infrared film the Gatherguru website. filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left hand side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters for film screening and film sensitivity. if you want to simulate the graft texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator has changed the amount of film grains and the dominance of the colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filters of color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared fillet applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original picture is below (1) and the illustrated picture below (2) and the image of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digious; filter movie isolation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for the sensitivity of the movies to increase the manufacturer great silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The movie isolation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want to get a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you like this special, Gallery-such, street photographic, grained sight specially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the knob, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grain. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, in ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-effects described on a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digious; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a protected outdoor algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug. filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like a oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs around this effect. the upper chooses the pin size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for big pictures. smoothing controls the glass or, from the other hand, the hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the processing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensgradients to generate a carboneskizze. therefore, images whose gradient are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to skating you. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the bottom tuning the contrast (gluten).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved further by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug. filter engraving shapes your picture in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug. filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color does not use the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondara landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to set the contrast of the filtration. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the illustrated picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork with distortion effects. it uses the protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the picture in cells and can look like it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1 is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can stop this effects at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work using unsharpened effects. it uses the protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpense: wiping the image along the circular lines going out by a central point. this simulates the unsharpening camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radiale unsharpened: do the image through rotation of the pixels around a center. this simulates the unsharpeness of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Rangesharpness: wiping the image to produce the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement unsharpened: wiping the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the unsharpened linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft-sharpness: wiping the image soft in the dark and strongly in the light tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shiny focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour-photos or add a warm and subtle incandescent light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Continged the image by random shifting of pixels and simulates the unsharpenile camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpeness: find the colour pool in the image and wipe them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the picture in rectangular cells and then created it by the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops onto your picture. this gives it a natural look of a clear appearance. it uses a beech seoshyn urhee legally protected algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allows to change the size of the drips. as the tropic size is not able to decrease the size for small pictures. number changes and density of drops. fishing changes the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep up with the & digious; photo processing a range of free from raindrops. use the tool set to select the range, e.g. a face that will remain free. if you start the filter shelf, the area will remain free of shelves.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the beaded picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformations and transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo on a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to resight is simple. the big question is, how can you find a picture? how can you find a picture? how can you find the missing information? how can you find the missing information? how can you find the missing information? how can you find a good job here. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo set the wrong size you can scaling it to the desired size with the size of the tool size. select the size of this menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for the size is using a linear interpolation method to extract the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool to bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Splines Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiplug was developed. the underlying algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to change the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New size and will be recorded below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original size is retained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Rule: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher value is set, the more will be smoothed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as well as loading are used. each entry for photo can be saved as text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo shooting is very fast when it makes, but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo shooting by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a common operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture. the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse, press the mouse button and drag the rectangle, and you will see this rectangle with your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you get rid of the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. this will get you a good overview of your photo according to the cutting area. you can also create a new rectangle with the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be opened by simply using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut-cut button of the button button in the tool bar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or Save In the menu to save the newly created photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by move the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high format or landscape format. in the size of the size, the larger value of the height and in the transverse format is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool after aspect ratio is used. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you use cm, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to choose between horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can use the Max. relationship button to cut the area to the maximum possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool allows you to cut its settings on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as standard values in the orientation tables, so that the EXIF data will be mirrored and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of merging aid allow it to help you to put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-paragus, harmonical triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a pitch propagitate on different natural growth models, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pel or the bleeding leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things which we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the error number 1,618033988... and it was used to build the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is from Fibonacci eps. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two. the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden centre. a composition that this rule is considered a visual harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquefied relief lines if you put together a picture. these functions will be recorded at the bottom below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring your goal good results for your photos. compared to third-party paragus, the golden spiral of the eye can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral, creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangle. it should be something that the eye is in the center of composition. that can be one line or different objects. this somewhat can be simply there without the eye, it will carry out his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also from the top-discussed golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles does not include the equilateral triangles. diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object of dynamic object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use gold triangles to stop your frame, you will create a effect of professional photographers dynamic Symmetry. try your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal and Vertical reflect can be used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the support lines can be invisible. on this type, you can customize the color of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture where the things are turned around an angle. you can repair this with the & digiplug; photo processing and the tool-free rotation. select transforming Free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slide are specified in degrees. with the button settings, you can set the slide again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module is a horizontal and a vertical line available. move your mouse pointer to the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. an opportunity to repair it is the function transforming to use of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the function of automation. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing glaze the picture a bit after the rotation. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectral transformations are carried out by a fixation point to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your picture. the preview will then be updated automatically. on the right side of the dialog box you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">The width of the new image shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image will be contaminated. for individual adjustment, this effect is small but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After that you have changed the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one possibility to transfer this is the image with transforming cutting from the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part to the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. with other words, a rectangle is converted into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transformer.</seg>
<seg id="679">Tighten your image by pressing the horizontal angles and vertical angles. if you press on presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effectiveness will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help your help, a vertical and horizontal line are embedded. move your mouse to an important point such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to attach the lines to adjust your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After that you have carried out the shooting, the picture becomes a bit veritable. for a single shooting, this effect is usually neglegible, but two chings produced twice as much relational and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shooting, the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is the picture with transformer cut out of the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digious came; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats are therefore from your system and, in some cases, from the species such as these libraries are compilated. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization tools are available to localize images geographically in the spherical coordination system, which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS gauge as XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Figure Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can lead a number of selected images with a GPS trace.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. in order to load a possible correlation of time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. this file contains, of course, data from the same time to the same places, as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded a automatic correlation was carried out the coordinates into red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore, the camera is converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set up your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">Setting for the maximum time deviation is a lower deviation for the GPS time and camera time. the deviation below are the data collected. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have a track data from a place for pictures you can add the GPX file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in min. can be used if you don't have any matching data. if you know that in reality a table difference between camera and GPS, you can set this boundaries here and then press the button correlate to the interpolarity.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialogue. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog box will use the coordinates from a call to the next notice, you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map according to and after which you will have. choose the appropriate region and enlarge it again through until you have reached a sufficiently accuracy. the card must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a dip au.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module is using the packets MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a base image file in MP2 or WAV of the Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All pictures are scaled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can create a background color for the slide. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are packed into MPEG Diashau. after that you can create the module via extras MPEG slide.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures are included in the portfolio below. there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. if you are using different formats, DVD, Xcd, SVCD and VCD, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely to choose the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds. the speed of the image process is specified below. a lower value is generated very sudden, a very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as a next. in doubt you should set them black. in doubt the name and the path of the created file you can set up under the name of the MPEG-output file. keep the extension mpg at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. after you can start your wishes, you can easily drink the generation of your computer. depending on the speed of your computer you can enjoy a coffee and enjoy the damsel if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packets on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistent allows you to print several pictures on a paper paper along in standard Photoons. these combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing gp. this is useful to improve your printing or print the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your files stored in three format files in one of three formats to JPEG, TIFF, or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original size of Him is not expected that it is generated by dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, choose the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw's image Converter window appears then in the mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the white output. the essential parameters such as Gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can process the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contracting information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains equal and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss of algorithm and produced for the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your picture and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you pre-edit your pictures often or later, you should not use the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose to JPEG as memory format, the metadata are stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion. if you want to break this process, you can stop it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking mode allows you to convert various images on one time. use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single picture which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available to how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of one album. you can use the prefix, the starting number and timestamp of the time.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several pictures of an image collection. it uses the transfer program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image or zoom it will be added to four types of image changes:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image will be automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: no proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed to this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing: preparing the picture for the photo pressure. the user can set the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected images with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the sent pictures before. further pictures can go on to the list of the left pictures and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the pictures window with the selected images will be displayed. you can add additional pictures by clicking on the button. for the last selected image, a preview can be displayed on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures on the picture list and add it to the list of added images.</seg>
<seg id="875">Remove the selected images from the list of the selected images from the list.</seg>

<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & coloring album; and other applications that are also using KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported in albums. even if & colouched album; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & speed album;</seg>

<seg id="1025">Each object has a visible level of view. you can specify this value relative to the visual level of the excessive value or as absolute value. objects will be displayed only if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the level of the visible level of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and view of the object features are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like to use the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement, you can adjust it as desired. you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To draw a window over or below a view, then draw the beginner to the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can rendering them. & kpovmodeler; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be installed properly. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click the icon Rendering icon in the tool bar or select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="1037">An Render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s INI files. he determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add any number of Render modes, from a quick preview of up to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar or in the menu View Settings... Select, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but sense is a name that can recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size you can choose the width and height of the desired image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box and enter the image section into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality, you can select the properties that & Povray; for rendering, this is a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection light. a detailed description of the rich characteristics can be found in the User Interface book & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only a beam per pixel, different errors can be created. these images often have a moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, sometimes more details will not appear when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technology called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. in general, pictures are better from this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn anti-aliasing, it connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is still working again and adapted because the recusioning depth depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray controls a beam per pixel. if the difference between the values of pixels using super-sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the values are divided, the pixels is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which will continue to be tested individually and set on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the records can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jeying. if you turn Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse lighting reflexion is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be computed by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can set the object of points on the grid in the context menu of the wireless model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and screenings.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate a more precise wire model and thus a better sewing unit for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball you can set the detailed stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the detailed projections for advanced projections, all wireless model views are subdivided into the camera. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall is mounted behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross it, there will be a bottom below the objects. the floor will be displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you want to activate edge detection, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more details on the parameters can be found in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in the section window arrangements, you can create and save window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window arrangement: shows all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window rules at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The tsunene window arrangements shows all existing window arrangements. you can add a new arrangement with the button adding and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below name shows all views of the chosen window arrangement. new views can create and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unks the windows under the existing window, with cardboard box, you will not enanchored the view inside the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you can create simple scene in this guide, you should very popular among beginners: a ball on a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings, before using it complain that you can only use a black screen when using a 3D program, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result, you will receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you insert no sources of light, your whole scene is in the dark and you will get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all error installed, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation that you can expect an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, therefore, you should remember the menus and symbols, and they also realize their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to remove this guide, you must first remove all objects from the property tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera is watching the whole scene which you generate. in particular note that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click here, you will see the contents of the object features, in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation on & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera, but note that you can change the camera in view control points, with which you can change the camera in the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag him to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button on the button or the input button, change the wireless model views and the object baum immediately change these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could set a quader (insert body Quader) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a consistent method for the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually, a simple way. you can use an infinite level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good Council: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button user or the input button. the new name is now displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the plain, if also at the moment only as a limited level. when you rendering the scene, the plane stretches out to horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you are looking at the property tree, you'll notice that you can see the entry for the ground. in this case you will find the different parameters for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object features.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just making some of these parameters. choose shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select a little bit out at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select as the object should be added. please select the name in the object tree. you can see the name in the object view (name = floor-pigment), with one click on the button preview, as the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course the preview of the pigments only shows a matt black material because you need to check the appearance of materials any time with one click on preview. now, you have the colors for the pigment. also there are many possibilities, but now take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see a color on quader and ball, click on the button on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is now correct. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course these are not the colors. they are not expected. in the color list you need two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can do this entry twice (you can also do this entry twice, but the chess board FarbenList can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select the colors every time and change the colors in the view of the object features:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be able to run, since you should have understood the basic work of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (don't forget the button in the bottom. otherwise, the ball was put on the ground, as you have shifted the soil to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering results now a strange result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. set in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the sphere, you can now have a material. as already at the bottom, enter the ball a pigment than paint:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose Earth object and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on ball pigment, then select one color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can get more interesting effects when you take time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the user or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of shine-effect and reflection result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal is not selected yet:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression that offers you & kpovmodeler; we hope you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracywheel is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you have a scene raytracer, the rendering of hypothetical spells (i.e. from the camera that reflected the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the rich effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects can be effected as such as fog. so the scene pixels is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without any camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source you can also see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously needs any scene that can be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly seen in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-playlist, player, playlist, playlist and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP-function break could look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok also has some of their own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should have a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script, whether all the required modules are available, and use the dialog that the user does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError = 'Corundum (KDE binding for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is, for this script.' the dialog --sorry '# {error}'.</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of presentation scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts, or simply use them to extend the required functions. you will quickly determine that the writing process is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can be exchanged with Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is the use of the command dcop; which should be compensated every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most script languages allow outgoing out of external programs and commands. additionally, the function exec () uses dcop &gt; relatively easy to be called. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends alert notifications to all current scripts. using this reason, scripts are to monitor their default settings and react to events. of course, a script may also ignore the events even though it has no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to view the setup dialog. to save and loading the setup data must take care of any script. if a script is started, Amarok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalized that a new piece is played. the script could now ask & zb; with DCOP functions more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the product length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume change new.Volume signal to the volume of volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customary MenuClicked: Submenitembers - Contains the path to the selected files of playlist, so you can use the DCOP-function dcop amelepilepscript addtion MenuItem (SubmenitemTitle), so you can remove the DCOP-function dcop amarok MenuItem (SubmenitemTitle) to remove a record again, you can remove dcop amarok script. eCustomMenuItem (SubmenitemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amingarok is terminated; or if the user stops a script, transmits & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, e.g. for storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarah Script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using bzip2 (.bz2), which can also be uncompressed using bzip2 (.bz2) that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 is only accept script packages with the extended amarine script. for this reason you should get your script packages right properly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main thing has to be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameters -p to obtain the file's rights:</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK requires only the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to install Cdelibs (including the included programs, because & amarok; requires some of them to locate modules or scripts). we have written a small instruction on how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as OSD assumes that your window manager will hold the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. we are trying to support amaroK on all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt, because these represent an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make an error in the Taglib library for days. you can see this error on the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org and also depend on the capsulated file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>

<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; it is common, supported & K3b; mainly two further parts listed below are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP-Interface from & K3b; features like copyCD, format-format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject ()) DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () - copyDvd (</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one can create a DCOP reference to the newly created project: # K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using # dcop K3b K3binterface currentProject Through Use this reference, it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the top-listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which only applies to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">EncreateFolder (Qstring name), createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring parent), addling (KURL:: List URLs, Qstring parent), rename (Qstring steps, Qstring newborn) (Qstring steps, Qstring newborn) (Qstring id).</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3b createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addurl / home / trueg / enfile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; reader for & kde; with it you can easily read audio CD; s read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for the reading of & CD; it is currently supported for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (loss-free compression). currently, lame be installed on the Linux distribution). more codiers can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of & CD; read and compressed into WAV files on the computer (loss free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the loss free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudiocreator; almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codiers have already been installed, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything, but only if FLAC is not used, it is not necessary to install any installation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What Kodieraser / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer provides a small introduction to Kodierer, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; if not the firmware of the & CD; this program is not possible to handle a protected audio CD; it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once again must be done (the setup dialog can be viewed as often called up to a suitable configuration), will be explained in the daily handling of a & CD; this leads to the understanding of the user's slender approach via which you will be able to stumble at the start.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert many formats - depending on which coefficients are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can you get & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without network, whereby everything is stored manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands of the main window. on the page you will find more information, such as this program is used as well as screens with descriptions of the registration maps for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB's CDDB data is set according to the installation of enquiry into the registration card CDDB. (this may be locally or online), in the latter case the connection is to be made to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">When a encoder starts to read and - when a encoder is configured in the tab setting for setup dino - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available Encoder, allowing you to read the selection with another encoder than the standard. it is possible to notice that before the encoder option configured in the tab setting dialog for setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager to encode an already read file, instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, piepsen) for Programs (how to read out & CD; terminate).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setting dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as encoder, to setup the Encoders). here you must go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, codiers and compression rates and helps you to choose the right Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is required. in addition to FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' Monkey 'which may vary for these distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, you lose information through data compress according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above that bit rate the differences are less important because both Kodiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will be supplied free with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - If only music is heard from one computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - If music is also heard on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music's acceptable results, and has quite a high quality. good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 GB = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate around 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of one title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate of 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good comug for music by youngsters. good comug for music by youngsters. but not good enough for better stereo stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting becomes exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you're absolutely the absolutely highest quality, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that will be collected manually or by the program automatically from freedb via the Internet are available as a list of parameters. they can be handed / used to generate and kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create the folder and file names and features of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with codierprograms, there is often a combination of program settings for the Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or help to the codiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; titles to be encoded with lame (English: day) if MP3s with lame be encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database in which the audio CDs can read / enter, so that all the other information can download in the machine. it is too notice that all the other information can be entered into the machine: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc., not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translation) is not attorney. however, nobody can prevent the information on & CD; more or less value, so it can't be added to the artist nor the music company damage. all information can now be saved in a Bummel by a & CD; business, physically or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is an address to choose (adjoining an address). for use of freedb can be used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address is not used to retrieve the data from the server (this can only know the programmer that has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; for use of freedb is needed, the geographical at the next-lying mirror server is needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freed.org provides a current list of mirror image for online retrieval of & CD; information during the check out of a & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which output program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to be more accurate in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution will be installed first, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the used WAV files, the Kodierer and therefore select the desired file format. during the opening hours there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss free compression for audio data) on the tab. other codiers can be added on this tab card.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coefficient may be used. this is also necessary for predefined coefficients. more information about Kodierer are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a body, further information can be obtained through the input such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have a lot of causes. check the device of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give a hint on what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not be prosper!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this tips can give you how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but somehow is still unsafe to do anything? well, no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you will get enough information about those areas that do the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time, all setup and our first & CD; read it lame '--preset extreme' to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyboards (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as a pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files that you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd has and that you own write permission (eg; by attempting to copy with the queror anything).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic set of & kaudiocreator; something probably is done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read out a & CD; what needs to be repeated & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the compression modes for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used to use the program to download the freedb to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it in any case of a & CD; if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is delivered to the reading program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom a symbolic link on the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can be accessed. if the device can be accessed with other programs, it helps to use the device records for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map general settings. here you don't have a lot to do. here you can define an additional conversion. in our example it will be shown as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only if you want to ask any information, you will be informed if the statements are missing for the creation of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The box card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download on the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during the check-out of the & CD; with the Internet, it is able to access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately, if you're unhappy with the database entry and file name / filename or day entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or file name will be easily changed - &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter everything manually, activate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, this is more than 620 MB large, superior to this twice. however, this will be selected twice if this is to be selected. in order to get freedb in the open mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. mode is set on the following cardboard card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freed. these are settings for the data request, for retrieve the & CD; information from freedb server on the internet. how is the system that data can be obtained? read the section about freedb. put everything as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freed.org page and watch them after a mirror server nearby. on this way the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work as well as to server the server, as many Firewalls the protocol 8880 is currently booted, there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP; protocol usually is open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we want to transmit any & CD; data to freedb servers should be enough to enable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings of screen photo. (please make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of outcasts simultaneously: excuse me, there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one device? parallel read and encode? the author knows it not, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last denominations: cross this to the & CD; to cast out at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom file for temporary files: if you can cross it, then the path / folders can be saved in which the WAV files are saved. if the box is not checked, the files will not be crossed in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to make anything with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All in such as it is on the screen photo. the command is something long, under circumstances must have something right after the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as already mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the record '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of creation of tags on version V1 / V1.1' ID3v2 'tags can also be deleted as required. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tagger for & kde; in case of later change of the tags (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each check out of one & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described, as the process of reading the & CD; it is described in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the internet is described, as we are convenient and the & CD; data from freedb is described in this section, must be repeated for any output and CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we do a & CD, which is not included in freedb, the screen photos will see a bit different than those for a & CD; with successfully retrieved from freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of the Internet. comments are displayed on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special "issue of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD must now be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; it could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen if you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD included; successfully completed by freedb, all the titles are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case that there are more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there will be a window appears, and you can select the database entry, which is your opinion on your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have the check box for automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings dialog for Settings), you can also manually redeem it by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you have no local database, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 2: the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo, the titles of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Update', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'Reeller title', unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidimmers per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD-editor (e.g. whether all the words begin with big letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use ID3v1-Tags. this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you have ID3v2 tags, you have set unlimited field length, at least on the settings of the encoding settings; throw a look in the section 'Fundamental Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information in the created files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all Kodiers resp. file formats. see in the help of Kodierer in order to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry, which is obvious to the style of the selected CD; this example is not important because we do not transmit the & CD; for more information please refer to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK', you'll come back to the main window. click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The windows of the CD-Editors appears again and you will see that the fields are already filled with the entered data, which we have listed for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the titles released in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and follow the same way until you have entered the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the item list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check sign before each line of each piece. only the titles are selected, or make sure all the pieces have been selected, or use the button all the pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button select the read process, this window appears to be confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window at the status of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a Kodierer that you have not installed yet. they were not successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked the write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the game's first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and encode parallel. note the status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behavior. however, the number of parallel processes is unclear. the calculator used with a AMD64 seems to read and encode no problem while simultaneous reading and encode (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is coded, and a third order is encoded in the waiting time of the Kodierers. after the last piece is coded, a small window will be connected with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & kde; 3.x or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you will need the coefficient of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1610">If you are looking for assistance like the program needs to be adapted to your needs, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many variations of settings. best you can learn the step by step example. it shows screen photos of different boxes of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still alive? even if only the Help menu was clicked on, without any reference point as it should continue from this somehow empty screen (especially if the program is running on the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>

<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you & kde; during playing a song, KMid starts again with the same song during the next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS maps (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First you can choose... from the menu File. it appears the usual file dialog, using its help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also download a file from a & conqueror; -window to drop in & kmid; this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and feel the button Abplaying in the tool bar, select the entry to play from the menu item or do the Leertaste.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts, once you go to the & kmid; window will pull it. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob and drive.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song gets too slow or to slow down, you can change to the arrows left and right of the speed display and so you can change the speed of the speed, double click on the template's screen.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The Leertaste has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the button on the button, or the exit of the menu entry in the menu piece, thus breaks the playback. when no piece is played, it starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Song lyrics can be stored on two types in one piece of music. some pieces apply Texternis, others use Liedteclipse and again other both. some pieces have no text (-)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust what events will be displayed and even better: the event type will be automatically selected, so that you need to manually adjust the Karaoke text. but you still have the possibility to change this, if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select from the menu settings the entries textures or songings. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summarise. these are played the series after you. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find at the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can adjust the desired collection manager in each case.</seg>
<seg id="1638">Into temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. consider that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, they must be selected in collecting manager. there you can add to the button adding a song. it appears again the file dialog with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setup Automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is activated, a piece when opening (using file opening or drag & drop) will automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection, it is enabled, when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and recled. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series after submenu from the menu collections, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be determined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in collecting manager or use the select list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the Next song, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the preceding pieces, the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">Temporary collection can't be cleared. however, it doesn't matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events will be translated into events that understands synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus whenever a trumpet should play if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a soundcard, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS-cards, FM devices, and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there is no programs to create MIDI-Maps. you need to edit the corresponding file of your hand (with your favorite bars).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications to play a unit.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END define KEYMAP "A further keymap... END define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that it is necessary to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as e-mail, so I can support you in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are non-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches will be specified as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is believed that GM Patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M optional KeysTo M is used to put this instrument on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is supported for example (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a fire-net. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP Section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">If now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (reinforcing), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this is meant with the concept drum patch of the patch, where each tone is another perforating instrument (drum, basins, Maracas & etc;), and not the one that means the sound height of the always same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument. use:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 items.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keyboards for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form sounds at the Percus channel. see the included Keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, make it easy in the CHANNELMAP Section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is depicted on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap is necessary to use the name name for this channel! if you don't use the Forcepatch option, all events will ignore all events that try the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the performers patch on the Perkussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBender ratio is multiplied, in which relationship pitch-bender events will be multiplied with the value n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) would be converted and then relayed again. the value 4096 will be used to do so in the map file no decimal commas.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM is that a keyboard player will receive a sound higher with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards can play up to one octave. in order to find the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. you will find in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of piano (one for each MIDI channel). on these manuals you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel you can select an instrument. if you have an instrument, the knob doesn't have green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the menu settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD displays the speed to play with which one song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information on how a music piece must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc. so the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices, just like two different musicians that can play the same score in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can still forced to use & kmid; however, a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have the control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This may happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; it happens because & kmid; without AWE support was compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source code (e.g. from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no pleasure to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add into & conqueror;, select all files, and drag them on & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Simply activate the setup Automatic add to the collection. otherwise the files are added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button on the left from the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo you can click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -Desktop a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop I must play if I want to play a karaoke file or I want to play a file, merely go into the & conqueror; -window will switch and drag the file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file without having equal to a collection, turn off the setup Automatic add to the collection, and the new file will add to a temporary collection. open from files</seg>
<seg id="1692">For example, suppose you have to play the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid you only want to play the first file. so, set the settings for the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join us to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent to me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I see these songs or see the postcard, animated me, further on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maths; Laga. at the moment I'm not much free time for my hobbies, but I'm trying to gather MIDI files, MIDI files, music and phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, a mistake or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write me an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You will really send me a giant, if you send me a postcard from your dwelling place or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who want to send me a postcard or MIDI file, you should receive a MIDI file, but you should contact me when I've got the file again.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my leisure time, and no man swept out for money. I therefore want to make sure that I only want to get more programmatic, because / if I get back feedback (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - Keep the error that the pitch is too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also applies to Jose Lus Sanchez for the testing of the AWE support, has Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter Cordes and everyone who sent me a patch, a error correction or also just an supported e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the net that give us this wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid; also on his homepage, which can be found under http: / / www.arra.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can find the development and look at the links with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have any soundcard you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it runs if you would have a sound card except you can't listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send a error correction directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& kmplayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, phono and FFMpeg. the program is needed for playing video files from MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, and to play DVD's, VCD or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & cappy; was not yet finished as & kde; on this computer has been installed.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website to new releases, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. it's always the window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window that will be displayed only if information is found in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to accept the preferred connections under the menu. if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other, you should use the category thumb playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an extra hierarchestufe. if you add an entry, his group and all its subgroups are copied to the current category and play it with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and thumb playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML Configuration files. it is also possible to select the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / cmplayer /, can also select from the menu view and as next handling mode. by clicking a sub-group will only display the XML content of this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, select from the menu on the same with playlist, or select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the processing mode leave or select another group without paying the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML Configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at starting and end can be deactivated by the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Change of [General Options] No intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted simply.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate any other animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / bit .xml and ~ / .kmplayer / external / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at start does not need to be short, it will stop automatically by opening a different source. this would result in the end animation, but the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">An easy example of a start-animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; smite; & lt; IMG dur = "indefinite" src = 'meet; & lt; / bodywork; In the source testing of & kmplayer; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL which are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to the configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. here you can set the path from the player and the intermediate-size of the data flow from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here the output of mplayer is evident.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback set in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swab-Mozilla:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be played the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, you need to play & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-Shockwave flash in the setup dialog for assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The queror or & kmplayer; is in a console application to browse and after error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library. if there is no error occur, the backend output within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This means a preheated backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if this has been determined also), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon can play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play TV cards either by using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be configured to use the tool and TV channels, the scanner can be edited manually, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Rekorder) Settings in the kmplayer is the dialog for Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be ports to be found. the encoding must be found (e.g. PAL for West Europe), the correct name has probably contain a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only work XVideo too (probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). in this reason, the videoforlinux extension must be functional for the X server. therefore, the video server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally are used by KMPlayer for sources different names. at the time of the creation of this documentation, these dvdnavsource, dvdnv, ecvector, tvector, vector, vc source, vc source, vc source, vc source, vc source, vc source, vc source, vc source, vc source, vector, vc source, vc source, vector, vc source, vc source, vector. if they are activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any indications like I can make my CDROM drive, if I play from him (not of the vcd: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -e 8 / dev / cdrom is working as a user root after the integration of the device. make sure that / dev / cdrom calls on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does my CPU have to be tested on their performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information like the font type and is available in addition to PDF the current output of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools to view, conversion and print out of DVI; files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the cleaning, the elements of the DVI; file is clicked with the editor, and once on a element in the DVI; file text was clicked on the exact opposite. once on a section in & latex; source text is clicked on the respective passage in the DVI; slide viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is simplified using several files. using a master document the work is simplified using other embedded .tex files. using a project can be set up a project-wide master document for project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & latex; source text is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (if no error occur in the source text).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File Outlook: in this mode the DVI; file is expected to be monitored by the following signal, and there is no call of & eyepiece; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In consideration of the processing tool bar, the three growers selection fields should be developed. the first selection field is designed for fast relief of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... Subject & latex; commands for the subdivision:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Further is for entry of articles such as Tags, FuÃ. notes or references. the available rates are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, a picture or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified name (selection above a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. it works only if the file is necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the author has written good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the & bibtex; files are also written in & kile; written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GraÃ ¶ t is used for the definition of the fonts for the main text, which will be defined on the box notes, etc. there are the following fonts for disposal:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling by & kile; two selection criteria are available: 1. the Assistant for creating a new document is written by selecting the document type and legend of the settings. 2. the document may be written by reason using the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the command\\ interval class included the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the fonts. if the font is not fixed at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the obstructed source code has to be entered, the & latex; source text must be compiled. the simplest way for this is the use of the menu building or the button of quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compilation. & kile; for storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compilation of the document should be sought after errors. when using quick construction and eyepiece; it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the protocol should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A setting (English) is a text that will be treated differently than the remaining document. for example, a report with the font e is created. for example, a report with the font names are created,\\\\\\\\\\ '. the order to reach the font in the surrounding area in the surrounding area (...).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes only will be supervised within the surrounding area (\\\\\\ 's} to\\' s). there is no difficulty in the surrounding area (number) within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many options for the possibility of reading and user-friendliness of the document. it enables you to obtain certain fonts, grease pressure, cursives, etc. these commands are either with the command\\ or automatically at the end of the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {emph}: this command is for the cursional pressure and is long as long as long until it is closed with a\\ bottom {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be recursively represented by\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote from the document. the quote begins with\\ Begin {Quote} and ends with\\ '{Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to the writing of the source text with the & latex; the recording language is now displayed, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as in the assistant a bit text was entered, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be completed. this should be a quote, some places in the fat and cursional pressure, and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">As soon as the document has been viewed, via editor-view or Ctrl E can be turned back to the editor (with an external viewer). when an external viewer needs to be closed in the window.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file is created, the document may be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an unknown file format (English. D e V ice I nally). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi Edition like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter, or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; files are the same steps as for creating the document (see). on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, then it can print the document using a file (if the printer is correct).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar is able to convert the transformation of DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & Latex; source text was created, the conversion can begin to open other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The advance search for the direct jump from the editor to the added position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setup for all & latex; you only need to set up Modern under Settings... tools Building.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to fix the required search, the mouse must be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on prefix. the jump to the respective place in the DVI; slide viewer is then sounded.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document and the corresponding line calls. must be specified as text editor (settings eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should when using quick-mounted & DVI; viewer can not be seen, a mistake should be an error, this should appear in the log file or displayed in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file extension refers to the error source in the source code. the log file will always be displayed on the line, in which the error appears. to consider the incorrect line, the error message must be clicked on the error in the log scheme and & kile; jumps to incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the button is clicked on the tool bar, a window will appear to select a window available for the document. the pre-set values are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">Selecting the empty document, a document may be written either from the ground or the assistant to create a new document. further information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">High-based users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates and templates are created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either a existing & tex; - / Latex; file would be created or a new file created. & kile; can create a new template using an existing document and create a selection of file template from document.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, some character labels will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character coding). these variables can be set in settings with settings...</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating the own template it is necessary to know what character strings can be replaced by what variables are:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this character string will be replaced by the input in documentation class. typically they will be used as follows:\\ Control Class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$].</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the Assistants and the associated entry for the commands in editor. as soon as the document created on this way, mÃ ¼ ssen has been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, then the own template can be arranged instead of the standard period.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files can be created. a simple way to create a template it should search for one on the Internet and can be kept under described steps below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; uses & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & Latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for the tools are made directly from & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and his testimonies are to be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; can be found there directly with the reading of the chapter by & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command conference which can be accessed via the help of the LaTeX reference. you can contain almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>

<seg id="1814">& kile; has the ability to browse the most different types of spring-textures and these produce. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can be found. there is a separate type of bookmarks in the text. the menu entry or the corresponding key stamp is highlighted the jump to the nast or last jump. thus, this diving stamp is highlighted so that they will automatically be controlled during the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The processing is probably one of the main aspect of use with a program such as & kile; even though & Kate; already excellent standards have been added in & kile; important functions for their selection. & latex; benchmarks for their selection. under processing, the following commands are contained in the text selection:</seg>

<seg id="2027">This action can be assigned a button. with clicking on the user you can assign a button zel to remove a keychain.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The easiest actions. it can be entered into detail in the detail and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position. see below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that will change the document or as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantitative dialog; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">For example, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myhome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scripta variable in the command line, such as sh% script. / actua / scripts in its path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / out of the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative; only one instance is running, the text is useful to the PID number. this is useful if the COP is used to control the PID number; the external script is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods, a script input of & quantitative parameters can be specified on the standard input. in the selection field input can be determined, which is to send to the default value. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of issue, to the default output, error messages can be specified on the default issue written by the value of the selected text issue:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. in the case it is necessary to create a separate toolbar. in the case it is not too many, therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you must add the actions and configure the settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts the edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the day attribute has and you plan their use, activate dialogue "tag" when available, so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a hugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; use Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to realize what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as los, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to user signal, click here to insert this symbol at least once; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must be connected to the action. this happens over the menu with settings. (in & quantitative;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text box there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button on the button and continue with other tags, so there are, or confirm you with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some common & quantitative; functions for toolbar complement or it should be shared this for a better overview through some separator into several groups. make sure that the toolbar can be selected via settings. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (quite left) for my toolbar. according to the selection of the element, the toolbar should be added, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I want to preview for example a quick way to access the queror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator will support grouping. someone who does not know my tool bar may believe that the & conqueror; -knob the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by test of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure to the correct folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be stored in the right folder, but your toolbar (n) should be stored in the right folder. please fit your toolbar (s) if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most recent extension of & quantitative information; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language that you like. for this chapter describes this chapter as I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantitative; -Repository, if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. we'll have to leave the first part here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the Main Index Top Element = Your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation = Sec2.1.2.2, # Sec2.2, No. 2, tag3, tag2, tag2, tag1 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc thee = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2-Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Encode,... Basic Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = Reg.basic-syntaxes. html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Please note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. that shows that there is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for chess boxes (except the understanding) mdash, but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents can be referenced directly to a file (and consistent in the upper end of the building view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Space characters have nothing, but pay attention to & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; based & quantitative information; Resourcendums will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the range of the docrc file, which is to be sensitively sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and file connectors.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of solving separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can store your file docrc easily and according to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quantitative / doc / apps for local and global use. then create a folder (as indicated this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are certain that these good and it is worthy to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation is used to the & quantitative; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative; are you not alone. it is possible to share resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else. at different places there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email to send tool toolbar with email, in context menu of files and folders inside the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where our team will be reviewed and only available for the publication. to copy a full post, we recommend the resources to sign up for a GPG / PGP key. therefore, the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team as well as for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase will not be saved) or in the case that you have a number of keys, the input fields must be completed (URL preview can be empty) and with clicking on the upload button.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), tool toolbar loading, and in context menu of files and folders inside the templates and scripts are begun.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before the installation, examines & quantitative. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not able to work by an DTEP package. however, it may be time consuming because hundreds of day files can be needed in tagXML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and Convert a DTD menu. select the .dtd file with the DTD-description which is to be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / demoa / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitions: the string chain that will appear in! DOCTYPE Day, such as HTML PUBLIC / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP according to the conversion: if activated, bring & quantitative; after converting the & claritionrc; editor, with details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitative; there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and full benefit from and quantitative concepts. this chapter has to offer exactly these concepts, without their understanding and quantitative; little use.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitative; is the work area divided into three sections: global, locally and projects. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantitative;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, der & quantitative; uses, available. of toolbars over actions, everything is selected as global, in the common folder of & quantitative tool; this enables the group of administrators to secure various tool actions, actions and patterns in the global tree that are available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local items represent a personal collection of web development funds for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are saved in user directory, so that they can only use this user individually.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Projecting elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; pattern up to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project. simply said this is the most restricts size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which means the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitative; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editors window, the building user, the carteiiters with infos and toolbars. please beat in, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document-matching entries, like to close the current, other or all carteireites, reload or upload the document, jump to an bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editors of the editor lead to another context menu (cut / copy / insert / insert), processing of under the mouse pointer, help the word under mouse pointer, or open the file, if the mouse pointer is called a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editors window the toolbars of the Editors. currently taking & quantitative; 4.01 Transitional is shown as a standard for which a set of toolbars are shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantitative; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated with the user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; in their document, click the icon to insert the day. now they should insert the data on this straight day (such as anchors), insert and fill in a dialog for different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The manoeuvre (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information about & quantitative; to navigate to open and walk. in the depicting with carteireiters are available for files, project, pattern, scripts, attributes and documentation assemblies.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantitative information. this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project using right mouse click. actions such as Adding, removing, upload or delete the files from the storage medium can be performed with which then displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantitative; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which connection they are used. the category is always available, local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are only available in the project. more to templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the script scripts. the concept of reintegration in Global, Lokal and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can call the available information on a script. you can download other functions like the script, edit or send an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one illustrates the internal structure of the active document. by left-click of an element, the cursor will open on the position of the element. by right-click of an element list, a list of commands to navigation and loading of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other building intentions. it can change rapidly attributes and name spaces. this allows the change of all available attributes with few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can create custom documentation for & quantitative information; you can create custom documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default and quantitative information; two cartridge units at the bottom end of the window that can be reached via the user-to-use information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cartridge reiter shows information on each in Quanta running script. so, e.g. the DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cartridge reiter shows all mistakes in the current document. & quantitative; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitative; toolbars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and you get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the tool is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantitative;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantitative; is the ability to send a tool bar with e-mail. & quantitative information is sending the toolbar as a compressed Tar-Archive via & kmail; if you receive a tool bar in an e-mail, you can secure this in & quantitative; as any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the location of & quantitative; files on your system. for this, autoconf might get a number of options that can be transferred to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at start of & quantitative; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folders. you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before their bin folders. same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantitative design; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to do the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantitative and editor; an independent, extendable markup-language editor would be? well, this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. together, if you can define it in & XML; then you should be the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above mentioned rights must be taken, that & quantitative information is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community is based. thanks to & kde; -rumours is not only possible to expand, but it allows users and developers, & quantitative information, as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantitative information; allows Web developers to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can expand productivity almost every task. by the program compresses you can notice & quantitative information. (more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quantitative; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quantitative; Plus is not connected in any way with commercial versions of & quantitative; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in details documentation is available with help: / quantitative (either this URL in & conqueror; enter or helpcenter help: / quantitative).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quantitative; is currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffix Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick list of files that you have opened. this list changed every time you can open a file, which is not found on it, the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project advance booking, only an error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted from the clipboard to include special characters to & HTML; write, so that they are correct and not understood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; compression, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used on the insertion of & URL; s in the anchors tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the recorder to or from. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; the error messages are available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Is looking for a character string or regular printout in selected directory. a type of grep or SED with GUI and predefined triggers to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the message window, or not to. that is the window where you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Exit and insertion of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantitative; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you have to change to the structure.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbolise links from the main window. this column allows you to set the bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If you are bookmarks in the current file, they will be foreseen in the menu with the entries preceding or next, depending on the position of cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from hard disk. & quantitative information; projects are stored using the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. enabling you to copy graphic files to your project folder or folder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project onto the server height. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded other input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantitative; the project managed. in chapter & quantitative information; projects are explained for details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites you a project of project tools. these are kept in project you / toolbars and are available only in this menu if you have assigned this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. it is created only by the name. actions have to store the tool. toolbars are saved via toolbars, or you will be asked when asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. if you don't delete the tool bar not stored, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">With this means you can send their own toolbar to someone (perhaps at the & quantitative; team that is present the toolbar in the next release). the menu item opens a new e-mail message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars on the main server where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load an & DTD; you can use or anything other of other and convert into the & quantitative format; own label format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the realities from the & DTD; is meaningful if the extraction of the & DTEP; if this globally is and a write permission in the global KDE file is not available, failed.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day entry dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific underway.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivated the smart insert of tags. currently this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insert means that & quantitative information is denied when this day is denied on this site.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed below the above menu points. click here. click on a activated plugins disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntaxes mode for the current file. the list of available heron schemes depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line identification. very useful if you know people know the other OS platforms to the developers. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the Tidy external application.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, it may cause time to cause or unnice graphics. it is also recommended to use the default card mode, which corresponds to the default setting in & quantitative mode; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu item contains an entry. the corresponding subwindow will be activated for each open window.</seg>
<seg id="2149">The display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantitative view; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application that use the KHTML Part, including the & Conqueror; -Webmaster.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Is the behavior of the editors window. in the documentation of & Kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you can delete or add entries from the toolbars or which can follow the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a assistance in accordance with the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantitative form, you will find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed at the top from top to bottom, since e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later with Shift; F7 Project project features will be set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example, foo. when entering the name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative; -Project file. by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine, which you want to access, except for local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If this field is empty, the default settings of the selected protocol is used. depending on the remote computer, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project is stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files used for various projects should be adjusted instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files used for various projects should be adjusted instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great when you have static web content you want to download and change. with serverside script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;), you need to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Notice that files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, are to be mounted. if a project is restarted on the project, do not apply.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of good quality.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files through anlinens or, by removing the bunch, clamps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant includes three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the menu with project features in the menu tree in sub-window profiles, or with the Push-button Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some adjustments correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in described below. the additional entries will be explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholder possible) can be ignored in projects such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Complementary option to the above, also files that are listed in .cvsignals are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which will be loaded when opening the project, can be read more about projection views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This enables you to select the desired debug. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set using the button options. in this case the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In sub-window profiles, high-voltage profiles (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile, by hand a separate building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In sub-window team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the sub-window event configuration, one can change event promotions, or delete these actions, change or delete. event actions are executed if a pre-specific event happens, such as the backing of a file. see in details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default it opens & quantitative; the last project that was opened. this behavior is not able to influence this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, choose Project... from the Menu Project or the Symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog window will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & Plaplus; closed, the project file will automatically be stored. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantitative; changed files. the same happens if you download a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project view are free access to the files in the project. the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders should also be open, however, the entries must be opened and open with... in the right button of mouse click menu menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the place of high output files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button will cut off to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the kernel and be forgotten by the program. this possibility is useful if frequency upload files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the plate is not coming into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitative; many high-load profiles can be created and therefore the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile will be displayed on this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP; file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Port for transfer. normally, this must not be changed, except the administrator administrator manages a service not at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your Angstshaft, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. please do not use it after your discretion. the password will be saved on the plate, so that it can't be easily read, but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. it can be loaded in a project, i.e., by simple dipping the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via Settings tool toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantitative and quantitative information.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantitative; best across the menu toolbars are stacked. use and adding tool will be treated below in the section adding toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and symbols can be created either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, a New toolbar can remove any toolbar or toolbars, which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool can be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a action (icon) on a tool bar, the entries must be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool can afford and set the actions in the menu with Settings tool set and set the settings..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essential documentation, code Schnitzel and files for linking. & quantitative file; used as a usual file system with advanced organisation and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any on the system existing directory in the template tree. templates have in & quantitative methods; in about the restrictions you want to set up for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions on the beginning of any template that be used exactly.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file besides text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are normally inserted in documents using a link below global templates. further information on the templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text documentation. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, a simple scaffle for the purpose and organises the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is necessary on a template but the same text area can be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment through a complete volume system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are serving as a templates. they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a file structure, in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantitative information.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a documentation structure to exposures (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select File Recovery Save As Local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as it is done, note that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see below the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select your text in your document and store it as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be moved with pulling and place on the construction site templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be used in a template folder. it can be used all file management functions so for example, pulling and insert or insert over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a folder on the right and file files to a folder on the right and secure site template to secure a name for the template and secure it as a default folder, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project Management allow a very goal oriented approach. you can create headlines and footprints or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files or link with them. additionally you can keep some things when using templates in projects very deep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the basement templates are based on the $KDEDIR / share / demoa / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / demoa / templates / templates / quantitative / templates and export / quantitative / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as stated above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To define the behavior of a folder, in the template page with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu properties tab. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blended, as soon as the teristal attributes are heirs.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is by default and fit for everything except the master folders in the template. if a trunk folder is set as it would be explicitly enabled. in case of normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-module. if nothing appears, it is likely to be in a trunk file.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows four or recompiled text for templates into this folder. this might be general headlines or footlines for all templates for a certain project and allows copying of ingredients in a folder with special headlines / foot lines a complete presentation already with the matching headlines / foot lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we also have a context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; and source text editor which can be reached via the menu section. the first mode replaces the source text in two parts: the source code editor and VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and turn back into the source code editor described in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document, which & PHP; contains a small green symbol symbolises the Vohandán from & PHP; it is not possible to edit these directly with the VPL; editor is still possible to edit this code editor. there is no plans to change this behavioural behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, but that at the same time the changes are activated in the source code editor and the cursor in the source text editor and in VPL; this mode is activated, this mode is already active, the key pressure on the active cursor is activated by one window to the point where the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. you can choose between synchronization according to one click or automatically. on the selection you can automatically select the period. basically the recommendation: a small span for fast calculator and a large range of fun for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the documentation of the visible tags during work with the VPL; editor is also called, as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor is also called, as soon as a new document using the VPL; editor is used. this allows the reduction of the suspension process. this means that you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information on the document itself e.g. impact words for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added below the two switching areas below or removed. a click on the list allows the modification of the inhaltes, such as key words in the column name and keyword keyword keyword 2 on the content of the column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of design of the design of pages in browser. you can add CSS rules to the list below the list or delete. a change on the list is exactly like with the meta elements. the processing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to put an external CSS style template by clicking on the file button and chooses the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is like in a text processing, possible thanks to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor is possible. the selection can be inserted as usual. lyrics can be inserted by tipping and reboot using back button or reboot.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be made in the same way about the toolbars as in the source text editor. there is to be aware that the insertion of tags are not removed beforehand, e.g. an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed every other ambient temperature.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the tables assistent or the Listen-assistant are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; later, in this release, tables or lists of tools need to be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for the same. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributions had done many changes and corrected the inclusion in many places. another programmers had changed many text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts to merge.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the recovery had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, any amount of more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you would like to compare it quickly, copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-like file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way-merge is fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of body and changes. the original file (the base) helps the disclosures of conflict and shows the result at the same time. in this editor you can even edit the result. in this editor you can even edit the result of three Quell files when merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also perform the same and merge folders. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and divered the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check Kode, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed clearly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters you can see at a glance at a summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble more if no one changes the recovery.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates that file is different. red color does that both differ to files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same names, but in different folders, you can make the tippwork easier by using just the file names from the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder 1 folder 2 -target Folder Folder Folder Folder 2 folder Folder 1 folder with folder 3 folder (2 folder) Folder Folder Folder Folder Folder Folder Folder Folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows manual input of file names. open dialog will review your selection and shows them once again. you don't need to specify a third file. if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the Button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, then use the same or merge of folders. if for A, select a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file names from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is crossed, the input field is active for the target and is not necessarily required. however, it is not necessarily necessary to establish an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The button button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set the options before you start with the comparisons / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare all the file, but only parts of a text. it allows you to pull text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts then immediately. in the opening dialog you will need to select any files, you can simply connect the dialog with the abooking button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and insert: simply drag one file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it rise over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes, a file would like several similar functions. if you would like to figure out how these functions are needed, they would have to download two respective files, download them in & kdiff3; download and compare these relevant sections simply, insert and then compare it.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can extract nothing out of & kdiff3. only the release of text into a comparative window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors are interpreted the pulling and add text into another program as outcut and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such cases your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window is optional).) Any info line has a different color. (if the path forks to a file, then let the mouse rest a while on the line. then a small aid window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source star are the letters A, B and C. a has the colour blue, B and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, you can see at the color, which is different. if both files are different. (colour for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text, the column column is displayed. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding colour. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful only to see the relevant modifications. (at C / C + + e. g. are white characters only in strings and comments, relevant for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summaries of the text is interrupted at the places where the source file is not activated. if the line file is activated, the line is displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (below the comparative screen) has also a info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [encoder] if you have processed the result. usually it contains text, but often also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the Save is deactivated!!! (do not use buttons to find out the next conflict in order to find out the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative monsters will be used, every difference in the same conflict must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the group is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. this group will then be shown to the current group.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area, and on the left a black beam will appear on the left.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by the automatic merge or by manual processing, no further line remains in the group; then it is only a placeholder for the case that you change your opinion, and perhaps again a different source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marking which you might want to copy and anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merging flippers; however, if you copy such text from the result window, please proceed with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate to the keyboard and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can use the arrow keys to the left, side, at the end, Ctrl-start and Strg-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. the overlay column may be used in addition to the vertical frame bar by clicking also to navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to do. using the insert button, you can switch between single-feet and outdoor mode. (default is the insert mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns you synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the section) and the editable output window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / previous difference (Ctrl-Figure / Ctrl picture), or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Image) or to the next / previous conflict is still considered as conflict. therefore, the conflict must be distinguished between soluble and unaffected conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection into the clipboard, you need to automatically copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insert). if it is enabled, you will select automatically to the clipboard and automatically transfer the manual copying. however, this option is careful, because you could easily overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line numbers are stored accordingly to the access operating system. UNIX variants are using a line-up character\\ r\. Kdiff3 maintains the line file of the source files not at, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and restore the next start. (menu Insert - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a lettering with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog box also introduces variable width to choose from, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in cursive script will be displayed. if the scripture doesn't support this representation doesn't happen anything else.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be loaded automatically. on these systems the button settings are automatically an uncontrolled color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, button key is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When entering or return, the submission of the previous row is automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to clipboard. the manual will be converted to clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which type of line type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection of the operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In the same of files attempts to find & kdiff3; first step, all completely identical lines can be ignored in the source files. only during this step, white characters will not be ignored. in this step, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car drive '\' at the end of one line, but then you could save files with different sizes in the page-to-side comparison, though they are different. if this option is enabled, the car signs must be disabled. during the merge, this option must be disabled. while default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored, but they will still be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The default option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively for smaller differences. the option is activated in the default position. it is effective in complex and large files but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automation-forward mode, this setting, how long will the result of the selection will be displayed, before the next time is continuing.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically solves automatic all conflicts in white characters used as a source. (default is manual selection.) It is useful if you need this only from time to time, then use the automatic selection even conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + -comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and merge with a merge. look for details below documentation to the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and an older version exists, then the original version is the suffix .original file, if already a backup file with the Suffix .original exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts to the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need to stop and reboot, so the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; it is not available because the language is set over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coefficients can be adjusted separately for each entry. if you activates this option, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding is a short notice that is the local code. (this can't be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this translates as special signs and interpreted and interpreted. since the coding for each file can be individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have a file, you can set up here which should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, you may not might work with your codec. (e.g., if your files can handle 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only change with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the coding of the output of pre-processing forces.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress herring in white characters in the text or review to the text or review. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + -comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a colorless coded overlay column. but sometimes you might see only the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & B; C, B & B; C; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second oversafest column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen better for long lines. simply select the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">When the comparison window will be arranged next to each other or to each other. this can also be useful for advertisement of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file names for the output file as a preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is displayed first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own premicroprocessor, which corresponds to your needs. for example, you can use this function e.g. for out disturbing parts or correct correcting.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command. if also a normal pre-processing command was given (see above), then the output of the command is used only for line-processing. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds to your needs. each input row must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable the user to allow more flexibility when creating the Diff results. however, an external program needs, and most users would like to program that, in most cases SED or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command to convert the input into large letters: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 's first text string is referring to the found text in the first clammernfew. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>

<seg id="2354">While you experiment with SED, you might have to understand it and perhaps you may see this regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignored of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for line equal to appropriate. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'each sign between' ['and'] 'is a suitable matches, and every hits will be replaced by nothing but virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several conditions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the requirements of one another. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED, you can also use something different such as perl. perl -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch '. however, perl only needs some details. where SED\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor will maintain for display and merge. further operations change only the data that the line-off-algorythmus can only be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off preprocessor sees the output of the regular preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but how in each function, the text changes or differences, you can't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to process many files in a folder. from this reason you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... for every object a proposal to merge; you can adjust the suggestion prior to the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the interaction and displays the simulated changes to perform without they really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6-key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the comparisons and merge of individual files very similar. you must only open folder to the command line or dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, Folner1 is used as a basis. if no target file is specified, it uses & diff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start, not to run the collateral. to select the collateral menu or press the F7 button. (further details will follow).</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the file, you will be informed of a small message window on the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files will be listed below, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder was found during the scan, here is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually displayed. you can simply click the folder by clicking on the + / - click, or click on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys on the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions. fold the folder button with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file is started and there will be a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type varies from different folders, then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such cases, the Cordless hr action can not be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this species again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical if their whole content is identical. then also folder the same color. at folders, the age is unsignificantly for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colours of a leaf that is only green, then yellow will be and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... and C identical but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if a A file and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faults objects exist, the merge may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g. if a A file and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faults objects exist, the merge may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active if only two folders and no explicitly enabled target file, and if the option directories are synchronizing. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action is to be identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: assemble and save the result in both folders. (the user can be copied to the visible filename for the output file only B; directly after the merge copies & the diff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of merge (unsecurely) activated, then investigated & kdiff3; the date of files are different, but the same date will be identical, but the date is identical.. Solange such bugs cannot be removed, the merge of the folders can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merger, there is a file after the collision. it shows the status column shows that when the merge was successful, and according to other reports, if something unexpectedly occurred, you should make a final review and see if the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in setting up the file's comparative analysis is selected, Kdiff3 will show other columns. these include the number of unmonasteries, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for soluble conflicts will only display when three folders is compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either run the just selected entry (file or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all the collars actions you can run together (also in all subfolders), you can run the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a target folder, then in the Three-folder merge mode C is used as a target, while the two-folder merge function will be chosen as target and used when synchronizing A and / or B as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries must be displayed in the target file, even in the folder rusts. there are several options to avoid unnecessary surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directories start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keychain). to merge only the current entry: select the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If due to contradictory file types still exist nor invalid actions, a message appears on the incorrect elements. you can select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options, perform simulate and break down.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you would like to see what would happen, without the really changes. you will receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (together a single file), then a merge window will open (please note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready with a file, select folder / continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the conclusion of the list, you will see some troubleshooting. if you want to continue to skip the cause of the problem. so you have the opportunity to select another promotion for the entry or to solve the problem in any way before you go with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were taken together, remembers & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and lead them not again. even if the merge has been relegged or not saved, these entries will be performed once again. only if you merge the merge promotion, these entries will be remerged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit onto the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree. can be entered into the element tree. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default value *. folders must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this design are not shown in the element tree, use the semicolon; as a partakers. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this design are not shown in the element tree, use the semicolon; as a partakers. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autmatic files will be ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this file specific with a .cvsignal file can be set. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignal).)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding place. in other file systems marks a preset point. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is shut down, symbolic link is compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to the links. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links such as normal folders will be treated and recursively searches. (note that it would lead to a folder loop and lead to diff3; crashes off.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A full analysis of each file leads through and shows the statistics of the statistics. (the number dissolved, unmonasteries, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis, and considerably slower when they do not contain files that contain no text. (specify a corresponding Anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folder on a slow network, it may possibly be faster, only the change date and the file size will cost you a certain amount of safety. please use caution. this option is default in the default value.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered as identical if it is equal to size. that can be useful if copying the change date. please use caution. this option is default in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the sync mode if two folders are compared and no target folder was reported. in this mode the proposals are identical to the merger. the results from the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is suggested as action. (this is considered uncertain, because it is believed that the other file does not change.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced, the original version is renamed and will replace the extension .original. if an old backup file already exists, this will not only be deleted without any further backup. this option is also enabled in the default copy. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the file merge view is visible through the merge of individual files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the window into the window menu and switch the window into window & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply using double-click. nevertheless, you can use a single file directly into the menu. as soon as you want to run the folder, the status will be done, and the file will not run once again if you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status goes lost if you read the directory again: list -menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax as local files and folders. a few things should you notice:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively and.. do not contain. it is not possible with URLs. these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, idle &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then there is always a file as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit authorization or changement date. therefore, the permissions or change date from the original. (note: this is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main application is currently as a differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts always the built-in differences viewer. in order to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in Kdiff3Part view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as KPart is applied, it adopts & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the program starts to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as Part 3, it is only supported the same of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or the same of folders will not be supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now hot-pare) is already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already shows that it can merge the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot by what I have seen in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers that have gone to this way or let him go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program compiled from the sources and configure the default prefix to KDE. in default, KDE installed the resources for the user interfaces (e.g., diff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters varies, these lines will be treated as identical; however, if only one non-white characters varies, the line will be treated as not identical. if it is not identical to any other, this enis coachable this enis in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is stated for any difference in the files where it starts and where he ends. this important information is simply saved when the result is simply saved as text file and it's too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can select a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to process the larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text is suddenly laid; no src left; appeared and the text can't delete. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to come from differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. do not use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To utilize all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information about how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the changelog file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & install 3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system, installed in the KDE. if you are unsafe, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not appear any problems when compile. however, please tell trouble, please report on & kite; -mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Umschalt removing) copies into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences show: files that are identical in all folders aren't appear in the folder ruction, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you have to update the folder to these options with the function Refresh.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to display the differences. this also shows that identical files will not be copied to the target folders. if the target file does not contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behaviour is probably replaced in a later program version.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group at the end window (if they are not already available), if the lines are already available, clicking on the button on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Default, this option is disabled. Underdifferences in individual signs (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a minipreview of all virtual workspace. it is quite practical to change their current programs to work, to stop her size or move it. this works both within a desktop and with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can view all virtual workspaces as well as those in the current applications. applications can be selected and even move on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and also on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on it, where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of & kpager; however, the context menu can only be opened up to two entries. if, however, the context and the name of application as well as entries will appear, maximize, on the desktop and end. these commands are the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only if you click on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The application for the selected virtual desktop. appears only if you click on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, window can be moved within the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other workspace.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & kpager; the name of virtual workspace is shown.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Crossing this field leaves the & kpager; the numbers of virtual workspace. is it together with name Show, the names will be ordained to be ordained, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the & kpager;</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as a small window in & kpager; indicated otherwise only the empty workspace will be displayed to make their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the windows with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. remark: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager; the main window will be determined: classic can be known as from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontally, all virtual workspaces in some other window managers are known; horizontally shows all virtual working areas in a vertical row, which is very good for the presentation side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it will be changed in size, view the window as symbols or with their content and move. it also runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent triggering a switch... lets the dialog appears.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this can't be changed in the dialog for Settings: but you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc file with any text editor such as & kedit; or four. if you have no write permission for the file, you need to register and refer to your system administrator. in this file you will need to assign the key windowtransparent mode and to this value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & kpager; part of the package base is, you need a working installation of KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool, emulates a bit click on the same site. it is thought to help people suffering from the repetitive strain increment (RSI) Syndrome and which every mouse click pain. Moreover, it can do the pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain, which is created by clicking on the mouse, and helps to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you can find pain, who are coupled with the use of your computer, you should search for a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it even clearer: even if & kmousetool is helping to avoid pain, which is caused by clicking with the mouse, it is possible to use due to the mouse over due to the mouse, and as with all ergonomic assistance systems: the result can vary from each other.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click once you stop the motion.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent shifting activist, makes & kmousetool; now you move the mouse, waiting it until the end of the motion, before the mouse button is executed. the intelligent shifting requires a little practice, but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This retention time must be extended after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool will be out a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the button is switched on, the turnout time (1 / 10 s) is active. here the time will be set, the & kmousetool will be reset. after shutdown the mouse button, before it leaves the mouse button once again, there is no evidence for mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now it is activated by mouse button. this function is activated, creates a slow motion because of left and return a double click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt for the first time, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can reduce the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select there sound system and here the rider General. there is a slider sound buffer, which you will adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started; at any start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments please extract the relevant documentation to figure out how you start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings back to the values when opening the dialog. have already pushed the button on the user after the latest pressing of user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool, first you use & kmousetool, initially with the default settings. in particular, intelligent shifting should first be switched off. if you get rid of the automatic mouse click, you may later to increase the intelligent shifting.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it necessary to decrease the response times of & kde; with sounds too.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make aware of what places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window, which doesn't show a link. you can use the mouse on such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is printed, you should clean your mouse. this is usually fairly simple. the trick is that you are not only clean the mouse, but also the rolls that are in contact with the mouse sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as it happens, can be different from mouse to mouse, but it should be quickly clear if you see the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and pollution can easily scrape off with a flat blade or the barrel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system run by & kmousetool, when it was just an imaging process began. if you use the intelligent shifting, this means that & kmousetool does not mean any longer by pressing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool, use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists that you have a mouse click. this is reset to the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool will continue to execute mousclick and put the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to make it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of your desktop, if you are unable to retrieve the mouse button. safe zones for the mouse pointer is & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shifting, but I don't create it to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can easily move it into the clipboard, or to insert it into the clipboard, to move it into the clipboard, where you will probably prepare the mouse on the pressing mouse button. but there will probably be some problems once again. here are some advice about this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the intelligent shifting just if you just start to start & kmousetool; instead, check out text instead of the text area a mouse click, while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and again stick the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will play every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button is pressing a sound like a mouse click. later, you can use the intelligent shifting also without the audible mouse click. but it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, you have to use the XTest extension for & X Window; that should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and are set to be correct.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool, made the mouse button once the mouse pointer shortly afterwards. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI Syndrome and has prepared the atmosphere of the mouth-keys pain.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktts; for normal work with & ktops; filters are not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering, text is processed before being sent to the schedule of the dispersion tool. they are useful to improve language or abbreviations, a matching language and speakers or to obtain certain shortcomings of voice synthesis and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the work of filters, it is important to know how the program is working with a text. & ktops; distinguishes four kinds of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen-Readern has the highest priority. it will be set to all other orders and will hold these orders. if the issuance of the Screen reader is reread, the orders received again will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is hot to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output from news and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application, the messages are used. while you want to read a long text on a website, you can welcome you with & kmouth; someone welcome you straight to the room. & kie; -Notices are also News.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you use by the card orders will be a text contract. KSayit is an example of applications that uses textbooks. text orders are intended for the issue longer texts that have no particular dringness.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queue, except for the output of Screen-Readers. if an application sends the output of a Screen-reader, while & ktops; just such a reading, this output will stop and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen-reagents. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and give it to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filter are designed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Replace character sets of a text by other text. the fixing parts can be delivered either as words or regular expressions. it will be created with predefined character strings such as: -) by text or for reformat messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better comprehensible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformers use a XSLT-file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format into another format. in the scope of supply & ktts, some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speech selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of text or dependent on the program that send the text on & ktops; for example, if you have a female voice, you can read text by KDE messages about it. please read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filter has adjustable rules, according to which he is applied for a speech output. if the filter does not determine that his rules does not exist, the text does not affect the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text contract, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktops; it is sent by all activated filters that have been arranged on the side down. the processing through the filters are displayed in the list from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and it will be shown below the following entry dialogues.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the device of character strings, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison model. these patterns will be replaced in the text, then the text is exchanged against the corresponding spare text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose any of these names, he must only differ from the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the string chains in the column classification and replace it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is shown in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>

<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional filter filter. during the first start of & ktts, it will be automatically set up as a set of satin-border filters, but you can change its settings or more satin cross-borders filter, but it is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest option to check the device selection by way. switch on the card selection, which speakers & ktts. switch on the card selection again, change some features and check how the selection of the speaker has changed. of course you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>

<seg id="2731">You can then remove text orders on the card holder or cancel, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal satin cross-border filters will automatically be set if you can't go down to the first time. do not change anything to this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Compare text with a regular expression for propositional and add a tab character (decimalcode 8) to the proposition limits. note that the standard satin cross-border filters are attached to the character.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter will never be applied on & kde; -News (kv), warnings, messages or the output of Screen-reagents.</seg>

<seg id="2741">Check this check box when the property requires priority prior to other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when standing, this property is always treated as the primary feature. if you want to specify this feature, if you may want to specify the attribute language, if you want to specify a specific application in another language than that of the environment.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontroller center; that allows management of network interfaces, the routine and the DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a single, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting from K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & ccontroller center; create areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>

<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot be installed. physical devices and their drivers must have already fully functional and configured, that & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and the setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed for installing & Linux; with installed and furnished. network devices later added, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, corresponding to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings will be loaded when the network settings will be selected automatically, when the network settings can be selected automatically. starting with the module network settings this system automatically tries to detect the system on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform is not recognized, the right choice is offered. it is the platform from the list, select the distribution and the release of the best. by marking the attitude Not yet again, the definition of the network settings can be set automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings can only be displayed in system management mode. before, all options are displayed, changing settings are not possible. in the system management mode you will be able to verify the button mode at the right end of the module. it is the input of the password required.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the rider network interfaces can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be addressed by selecting the desired device in the list and pressing the knob interface... in the dialog box.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool can be used with graphical surface like a package or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but also the development tools are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic networks are given in the second, all by & knetworkconf; alterable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace more information on IP networks. in this section only basic information about the integration of the PC is mediated in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). "5 never has large spread. of IPv6 it is expected that it focuses in the near future. this description is therefore focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator to assign a valid IP address, or if available, the IP address can not be chosen as desired!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address accounts with the global (internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore it is possible to use any use.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, the addresses are used in the field of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is sufficient for networks up to 250 hosts large enough.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the mask mask will usually be on 255.255.255.0, so all the computers are on the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is required for IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part there are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically altered by DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if in the event of active DSL connections to find another content as specified there.</seg>

<seg id="2897">If everything goes smooth, the symbol is changing to the tape drive to indicate that the band is connected. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to the expulsion of the tape, first the integration must be solved. there are three methods to be able to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; announces by a change of symbol for the tape, that the integration of the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message to the tape. the tape can now be cast out without any risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a volume of & kdat may be used, it must be formatted by & kdat; it has to be formatted.</seg>

<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you must select the desired files that can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in a local file tree. only this file or the folder is secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a fisher profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the band indexfile using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can also download the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">In this way, a safety profile is created with the just selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a fuse profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current job folder where the backup should be done. the list of secured files will be updated automatically according to the selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, only those files are saved on the same file system, as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be downloaded separately under the backup file. each entry is considered independently from the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have been changed since the last inincremental backup, a snapshot file will be saved, which has changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup has been used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files will be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt;; and lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of compilation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings regarding the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be carried out:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path for the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must be transferred to the non-winding variant of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the band is connected to the drive, the command will load to the drive. in some drives it is necessary to run read or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The option is switched on, tries & dat; to lock the design of the tape drive. maybe this setting does not work on all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when soldering the connection of & kdat; the band is automatically cast out. use this option not for floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option switched on, tries & dat; the hardware block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable blocksizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need to stop & dat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only be a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is set as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N byte) The band ID. the format of this sequence is host name: seconds, whereby the host name is the name of the system is being formatted on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds, which has passed since the epoch in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can directly manage directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not around incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2941">& ksysteme log; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can obtain information on your system or where the system is stored on the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & kslog log; experienced users get quick access to the example of information on your server. & ksellers log; therefore, some extended features will be filtered and evaluated with the help of the protocol files on certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksellers log; a number of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocols, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included, and will be explained in the other chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, & ksellers log; features available to easily filters and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily and sort the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering in the next chapter of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & ksellers log; initially the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be displayed, so you will not run with system administrator right. the protocol files will usually take under Linux usually in the file / var / log, for the normal user usually no justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a limited range of criterion or according to the filters. in the default setting the select box will be displayed next to the filters all. then a protocol line will only be displayed, if in one of the columns contain the character string of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this place. the string of the filter search term is then displayed only with the entries in the specified column. choose the column process and enter it on the name of a process, so it shows & ksellers log; all protocol lines, which have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a conspicuous colour as protocol lines of the level note. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched to setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Would you only want to display certain process (for example in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), so you can check the process identification (PID) if you want to examine the output of a specific command as for example to start the Samba server. in this case you will use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksysteme log; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>

This is therefore important because someone could try out a machine on System V Init, without a reinstallation and new format. that is why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc will be directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole set of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service, which you want to start at the high level. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & mail;, httpd & etc., system services do not include such items such as setserial that is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie down under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for this file, even if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard volume level is listed in / etc / inittab. you should start a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can discard a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre-set runlevel 3 is necessary. if you want to change that, then you can change / etc / inittab by hand. if you have something wrong, then you will repair it by changing the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start now all the real scripts? if you are using -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder no correct files are located. instead, each entry is here a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start this script in the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would keep the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K includes, the script will be called by the argument. if it includes a S, the script will be called using the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to create a simple way, machines for many purposes. I could run & eg; a server running level, that can run only httpd, & shipmail;, network & etc; run. furthermore, I could also have a user level, das & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program has been created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to say to say trivial: simply drag one entry from the range of availability services to one of the six round level to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts between Runleveling or change the position within a level by changing it anywhere else. this will only be removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this happens only if they draw a entry from the availability of availability.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed if you simply drag them to a new runlevel, you need to select copy from the menu pane or from the context menu and then add to the target range - even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes be calculated. in such case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the environments before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the paper basket. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the various workareas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another round level, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired level level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or the name of a single entry, press the tab button to switch between different fields. do not use the dialog through pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I did with the standard Runleveling, and now the machine starts continuously. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel on a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under round level X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, such as system services in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for proprietary operations in distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are required, which are required from the respective system service (and even if they are located in the right folder). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply complete without message when their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send us information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation by & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you have to save them. either use the respective icon of the tool bar or the entry to save in the menu File.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user groupies. to do the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cartographs can only be displayed if you have enlarged system settings. only if you can create individual settings (Quota) for users, you will appear on the individual settings, if you are either Shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD-Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The box card password management appears, if you are Shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD -Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card may only be activated and initialized for at least one file system limit (Quota) and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user, whereby the maximum limit of data in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be selected individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field file system file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card groups informs about the users of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the field of primary group. furthermore, users can become a member in other groups by using this in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Dialogue Properties dialog contains a list of users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, choose from the menu users or group or click on the suitable folder button of toolbar. editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time to boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, modify, change and more.</seg>
