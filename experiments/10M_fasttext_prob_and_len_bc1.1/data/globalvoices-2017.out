although I visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extraordinary .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have picked up American music , American writers and operated in sports .
in fact , this country had a serious impact on me that I became mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the grand D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura @-@ Stud@@ ying , the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who wanted to inclined their interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was it as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else I would like to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you &apos;re always that you can , and it is easy to find in a community of equ@@ alled human beings .
I even had a very nice love cover about his size .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and ra@@ cial of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as it goes with its commitment .
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he says what he th@@ inks , as a former colleague it express , and declared his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and women .
nevertheless , people re@@ acts on his statements and tuned in notes for him .
the 13 million votes that he won by the republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever made by the Party nominated candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , asked me ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters with men , whom I had learned during my time in Phoenix .
such as my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , takes people from all over the world , a deep gl@@ om@@ less man , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
also , Tr@@ um@@ ps Uni@@ fication did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for Basketball and we spent many hours with the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; on the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz is also in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who f@@ ights for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , which treated me as their son .
it still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , which always helped me and help me and my colleagues to get to the complexity of the American life .
and there were Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice has helped me much in my career .
these people and those caused by them combined my love to America .
while the way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the equivalent of its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or maybe even because of his cont@@ emp@@ t to non @-@ white people .
the strug@@ gles with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they had either distributed his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , nearly the heart broke .
perhaps it is not fair to describe Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a ra@@ assi@@ sts .
the people said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is super@@ fic@@ i@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on another way and thinking .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes will not be taken into account in their congregations .
could it be that these voters , of whom most of them are , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to re@@ win control of a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they may perhaps say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks at those who look at those who look differently than he .
this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( note ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ jection of the White Against all Other Eth@@ ics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Word of white in An@@ play on the White and W@@ r@@ ash , which means so much does the great Van Jones called exactly what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always like , America is always welcome .
for this country chose as his President , twice the son of a Ken@@ ite , whose history as he himself says that it would be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with frequent , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America , after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on the ru@@ der , they say .
at all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
in a manifest@@ ation for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the human being .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have had my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud voice &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; have Muslims in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; br@@ ushed the lot .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were loud .
&quot; would someone who doesn &apos;t like to do a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a one @-@ voting and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; God be than@@ k@@ fully , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t it your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was con@@ ferred .
the country for which his son was , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find in this new America no more .
and that breaks my heart .

from El@@ end to the stars : these Latin American children can not leave their love to music by tr@@ ash ?
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
that music that is played on both places is not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill area , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ colonial Ru@@ ins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for a few years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found their musical instruments to overcome the over@@ coming poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church that is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico is known for their drugs abuse and the banana violence .
however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth had always offered a rare hop@@ el@@ essly .
the young band members take their comm@@ it@@ ments to the music group , the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
once they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their big passion .
you will always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bust@@ le you can learn day for Day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ ke , bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically at the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital of Paraguay - on instruments which are made of recovered waste material :
music with restored instruments made from local fixed waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the loss in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , trumpets and percussion that were made out of the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez re@@ members a local econom@@ ist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the initial time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach the parents in the rub@@ b@@ ish . the children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one out of the waste produced .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of recovered material and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary N@@ ames &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic land@@ fill ) shows the musical performance to :
the world generates about one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who are with him and live with him are the p@@ oo@@ rest - like the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into a little beauty .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ing spectac@@ le from tr@@ l @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work successfully against illegal fishing companies
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports targeted solutions for environmental problems .
re@@ published in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for joint use of content .
in West Africa it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing waters before it was seeking the other coast of Africa .
the Eastern African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly offered and a little bit inclined to con@@ fin@@ alize the crimin@@ als of this species on its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ po@@ res , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refused him to reach one of its har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing territory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that all of you could simply refused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he re@@ members the Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive employee of the Ken@@ an fishing authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship of a stone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch the fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia for pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and protect resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illeg@@ ally , F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries stop ) .
the members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries who had exp@@ elled the Premier of their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equ@@ is@@ cated and work together . they exchange information and stand on each other where it is illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ ming Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is being caught , so it is extremely difficult to grow . thus , illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
by the deliber@@ ate ab@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , which should be protected by means of certain living rooms and types , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem may harm a del@@ ic@@ ate balance .
however , during the actions of illegal fishing , once again , the actions were cur@@ ated by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , with the information between individual countries , the actions are today in real @-@ time , with tra@@ ce@@ ability on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there you can exchange the individual countries together for example lists existing licenses , news to di@@ gest activities or more details that one had noticed during an port inspec@@ tions .
fish @-@ i pursued the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive if they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this enables to mark the authorities to mark ships that are fishing in banned areas - such as such that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fish license where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal off@@ ence .
countries that are against illegal fishing catch can be found on the basis of this information that the ships can &apos;t be sold in their har@@ bors . what means that the ships can &apos;t be used to sell their charge , as in the case of the Premier League .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about considerable financial losses for the owner , what means that the illegal fishing catch is fin@@ anci@@ ally no longer worth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to reach , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , conduc@@ tive director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a cat@@ erer company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover , which lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i each year due to Il@@ legal Fischer who penet@@ rate the East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing catch from around the world . under these same illegal fishermen .
their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , speci@@ fying ph@@ ant@@ as@@ ia , fish protected species and fish in nature conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non@@ sense organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illegal and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t want to walk my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this legitim@@ ate hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
to date , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects .
it has exposed criminal networks , which had counter@@ f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and it has been persecuted and found .
based on cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing companies across large distances .
some of our research lead us quite far into the networks of organizing crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system that can help F@@ ISH @-@ i to multiply vessels of precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that has always been developed further , helps to hide the illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st with Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , a N@@ RO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships have to switch their automatic identification systems , where they can &apos;t be able to be able anymore by satellite .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal off@@ ences with larger precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of afri@@ can have actually influence the influence of illegal fishing problems ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be rendered to each of each tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it , who does what does - this makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and to bund@@ le their resources for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ ité Tru@@ sts to run a similar project with which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities did not only feel crime , but they also cri@@ es out .
ships that previously conf@@ is@@ cated without license and had hardly any consequences for consequences , they now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since then more licenses are buying more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board towing nets , whose deployment is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries notice these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that us now also copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are a study object . &quot; in West Africa disappear annually several hundred million dollars through illegal fishing .
there are six countries joined in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . even they combat the illegal fishing industry , according to the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; by safety , the aim is to create more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia could report on his first major triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were not allowed to have been forbidden .
the ship was still located in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the take of dimensional rules toward Gre@@ ko 1 , they were a strong sign that they go against illegal catch @-@ catch , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time , evidence is that such a special , collab@@ orative work works to protect the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
it is considered to be a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the President of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after Venezuela &apos;s government had rejected the request of opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country , in which they were gathered to the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the return order of Venezuela ) can be used both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the region Bar@@ inas , in the regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ part@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , resulting in everyday life of Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medic@@ ations .
many representatives of the opposition were seen in the Office of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance to obtain a fundamental change ; finally , however , the preservation of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government decree as follows :
within the context of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ sufficient lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to conquer his institutional structures and close a new government alliance .

great waves beat the news of the police suppression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves according to his own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ acy of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t wear coats , because you could see something many national@@ ities do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic shows the round that forms the extent of repression per day :
thus , the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had put the validity of the demand after a minist@@ erial procedure in question - this was now proven in the eyes of many of the presence in many more than few people on the road .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was forced to visit the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ean city of Cordoba .
in the meantime , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were examined for crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano hasn &apos;t chosen his life .
starting with the brush , the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has enough suffered .
he kept the family Secrets for 34 years .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ent .
as a child with 15 years , you will not notice that one is manip@@ ulated by his father .
I couldn &apos;t recognize that my father was a thief , Fol@@ der and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ e@@ officials . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was Deputy Commander of the secret service division 141 in the prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the history of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the history of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos son , a man who knew the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy in the course of the years before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child , and as this child chose a way of redemption .
from the Sports Hall to the Military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I had a boy at the sports hall there .
all they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo , and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a ar@@ ous@@ se , you have rounded yourself with one of the ERP .
pass only if you don &apos;t escape a day , and I will save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolutionary Gu@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers in Argentina .
therefore he banned me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would become secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father loved me .
at the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the det@@ ain@@ ees .
these were all possible documents : University reports , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ aganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ da , the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance of the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ itone , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little in a blan@@ ket wrapped pack@@ ets and commanded me to wear it by car . when I opened it , I saw that a large cl@@ ums@@ y silver was found in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen objects were taken and under@@ took me with a wax .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I par@@ aly@@ sed in and looked a Lie@@ ge on the human being tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fortified the end of a cable ; the other end was fast@@ ened by the body of the person who was just there .

the rock there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same od@@ our came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and me became clear that the smell of a body is in ad@@ versity .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me , What is it possible that a man can do another as much sorrow ?
&apos; I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were folded up and were treated with hands .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , an civilians who was also indicted in the process ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses that naked people with the face down , they were fast@@ ed at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people still quiet on the matt@@ resses .
when my father knew that I saw a prisoner , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , ass ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you meet me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know that , because my father told her home at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed .
( according to the survi@@ ving of survi@@ vors of the civil , Jorge Rom@@ ero is also indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process , students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina ( Molina ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way , where you came in here , is the way where they came here .
if you look on the map you see that they took about this road and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned to the process of de@@ formation .
when they survived the torture , the det@@ ain@@ ees were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the order came from above that they should be moved .
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of man and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all possible things with home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war &quot; - as they called it .
but when I was later on the military , - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that the yield of a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military cap , which one took away from the enemy that one fought against the enemy .

but if you enter into a house and then the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... steal , then it &apos;s no time yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always asked me , like my father , the head of security forces to join this V@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also officer in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never come to enter into a house and steal everything therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a crime and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You that you should go to the streets on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are no crime ?
he explo@@ ded me , and struck me , and cried , saying ,
if you go so far , then I will find you and get rid of you .
we need no one another !
that was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
when I told in the process , I showed a photo of at that time I had a jacket and a roller swe@@ ater made of wool . both my father had taken from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he brought them clothing with home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been with this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay a burden to me what they wanted .
I was so there to announce .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the glue is the last ab@@ h@@ ous act &quot;
now , where I &apos;m older , I guess I Reu@@ e .
I have children . if you only have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and recogni@@ zes that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
good , so did you know during the dictatorship of men . but why do they disappear for the bodies ?
why do children result ?
one day , my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this a little girl was .
I asked me again the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
you &apos;d have been able to put them into prison .
I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people , but to disappear their bodies ?
had these people not even families who could commit their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the surro@@ che is the last ab@@ h@@ or act , which one can do a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoner .
they were cr@@ ushed and somewhere . no idea , where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course always .
&apos; I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even with the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have just told the truth about 20 crime . it is my father .
the idea to view my father was created during a conversation when he stood under house arrest .
I made him because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed none . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt and touched me , and asked me what the entire bu@@ oy@@ ancy Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly defended it were actually well .
then I cried out :
how can you say what to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed a dre@@ ad@@ ful crime , and you have forced me to participate in a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly what did I do .
in 2010 , I paid the first display .
I finally knew that he was a crimin@@ als .
no one can tell me that I am sorry . I finally told my own father .

the sentences in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process ended for crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1978 and December 1978 .
43 Supp@@ res@@ sions were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and in 28 cases the Court hanged life imprisonment and nine cases of adher@@ es between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was hands @-@ free .
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants were killed during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder , tort@@ uring and rape through ministers . # Es@@ War@@ is terrorism
all of the accused were members of the military , including former military , former police , and civil employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti was ab@@ duc@@ ted along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the welding case :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
the Court is a historical milestone for all human rights organisations working for the victims for many years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the advoc@@ ate of the Argentin@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who were the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship , or disappeared , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the search took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ian government delivered the country to La Per@@ la , so that a memorial was erected there , which is now managed by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ U to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a center in Kyoto where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was dis@@ sem@@ inated in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos from Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a very particular disp@@ leased translation .
on a sign the Japanese word ( en@@ rol@@ ment@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means , too - maybe even with b@@ ö@@ n rear thanks &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; translated .
the wrong translation was available on electronic ads in the entrance and building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was shared in the social media .
the error was the translator Julian Holmes , a population of Ky@@ ot@@ os , which he was also atten@@ tive to the local newspapers .
the conservative daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult for elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; -@@ drivers &quot; ( german : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by appropriate , if also the gram@@ m@@ atical is not the correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( german : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture did not affect the translation error . we also declared that the error was already contained in the text that they had been tested by the translator and that the translation was not checked in their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sorry that older people through the in@@ adequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online News Service J @-@ C@@ ast News continued to look back in detail with the phenomenon of the &quot; awesome &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; was ref@@ ill as an appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved , but quite a reason to concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , in 2005 , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents by Sen@@ iors . this equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ egal@@ ese seniors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 caused by a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of senior citizen caused accidents in the same period .
the nam@@ ing is not mentioned re@@ porter in which published version of the article comments on the light , which show what pre@@ ur@@ ges are some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation error received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) is not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; So is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that a real translation error is . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; dis@@ sem@@ inated in all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true mine for those bizar@@ re bugs in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation were mani@@ fold .
to transl@@ ate , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the text and active language skills in order to transmit it into the target language .
the latter requires the active behavi@@ ors of target language - something that is in parent &apos;s language . generally , the persu@@ asion that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother tongue should be .
thus a French native @-@ language was to transl@@ ate from English to French - not from the French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ not employ people with English as a native language that could cause translations into English . this may be on missing understanding for the transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English speakers , the Japanese language .
some companies that have no foreign employees have left their own data . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best appreciated for trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and r@@ ying phr@@ ases that are created by mechanical translations , show that this technique has not yet been able to replace any human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages .
some of the strange English for@@ b@@ ings in Japan , among them also the r@@ asp@@ ir@@ ish im@@ prints which often uses T @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry nor un@@ acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but of great company or by the government who have the funds to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source of their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protest and C@@ ens@@ ur@@ gical measures in the internet and television to
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to PRE@@ N@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , ven@@ ez@@ oli@@ an Internet users found that they don &apos;t have access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online .
later another user wrote that the Internet access from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV was no more accessible .
other online stations were also organized by the protests in Caracas which were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups that Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro government had contra@@ di@@ ct themselves .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the tasks of the parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was shot and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezuel@@ an providers are again blocked again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access dental vene@@ ers , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ated since 2014 on the coverage of protests . at that time the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closing arguments when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission had seen it as an &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I have registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is astonishing that the cheaper is cheaper than two litres of lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO network fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was not accessible by a blocking of the domain name System ( DNS ) but also two other online stations . this also applies the website to the National Assembly on their sessions .
earlier re@@ resear@@ ches of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet providers may benefit from DNS . this is a technique that answer the DNS server in@@ quiries of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS server , the server answer is incorrect or denied the request when calling on a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ der@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ per@@ ched channel , the transmission was discontinued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV @-@ Cam@@ am@@ ann El@@ vis Flo@@ res , which had over@@ took the protests in Caracas .
Flo@@ res was struck , while he was kept in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went up again .
although some channels are accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government is regulated by direct connections to multi@@ media coverage over current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls become a slave to obtain a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she is visiting the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ dish , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which they did not eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies at the University , she returned to the house once again , and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride over her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who has become a little , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated as a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , in Paraguay , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a big family with little money over@@ lay their least year old son or her minor daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
however , that is not mentioned , however , that the children must aff@@ ord countless days of work , who can never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all that can &apos;t be raised within the context of a treaty which cannot be raised .
this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread practice in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating from her studies Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathering witness , calcul@@ ating and p@@ iti@@ vely .
she tried to name the things by name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is imp@@ aired in Cri@@ ad@@ itas .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is one of the family that her daughter in the belief that they do so their training , improve their position in society , and can make something from himself , to another family .
on the other hand , the family , which decreases the girl with him and just@@ i@@ fies the exploitation of believ@@ ing that she would not receive any training , otherwise no education would have been hungry and perhaps even was hungry .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will find out many years later .
sometimes they can never learn it .
in January 2016 the so far relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret area of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a vision .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was in the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her bodies showed violent stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military @-@ born Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as officials at the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira flew on Mar@@ ín until she suffered dead@@ ly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they are concrete that the ex@@ hor@@ ted child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Society of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came to protest in protest and demanded that there was no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photographs were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; compl@@ aining Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without pap@@ ers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which conditions boys and girls are living .
the neighbours of the sp@@ a@@ ars and nearly 60 civil society organisations resulted in a fast investigation in the case .
they wish that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case occurs before the Court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín &apos;s case could be considered for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a fall from Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before the Court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only be explo@@ ited as workers , they are also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when she worked in her father , she had to sign con@@ course and lost his father &apos;s work .
their brothers had to go all work and started to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employ@@ ers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
they had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn .
she rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for their employ@@ ers .
on Fridays , for example , pur@@ ified the fridge , cleaning the living room , polished the furniture and the infected .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more time they had finished with learning , the more time had her free time .
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never been hungry , but also won &apos;t be un@@ restricted food . &quot; I could get more books from the library of the house@@ master &apos;s library as a food out of the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the owner of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was part of the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was part of the dictatorship from 1954 to 1989 .
in addition to some evenings , the land@@ lor@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , alongside him and editorial articles from opposition leaders , such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to convince the reports of official media about the regime &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held her for intelligent , but kept not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t allowed me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I heard there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad hab@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who would speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , to home their mother tongue Guar@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feared the Lord , that they might lose their education , they would lose it again , explains them .
but it was completely clear that they had paid for everything they had paid out of them , with their hard work .
also in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ated . &quot; a thing that is almost never spoken , mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans , which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school .
because the other children are parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not invite you to my home . I did not have any friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friends arise , I felt very clearly that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society approved the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group in which one can view space for cleaning and nur@@ ser@@ y in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter , which plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
to learn .
please ask you .
starting from Monday , when possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman out of the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleventh year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , which also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children , and is very pretty , &quot; wrote it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third commentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the inner inner that works &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors split up once again :
Dear friends , I have found one . I look , if it works with you .
thank you , I &apos;m writing again if something is .
the business was finished .
in Pro@@ log for the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of witness , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , when the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores had under@@ gone and to just@@ ify themselves to just@@ ify themselves that many girls and boys become involved in a system of slavery , where they become a slight sacrifice for abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and these are the key to the understanding of the phenom@@ ena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill proposes Egyptian users social media to register in the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently ordered a bill to &quot; regulations regarding the use and commercial social networking . &quot;
if he is adopted by Parliament , users of social media must register and use social media in Egypt in order to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law a place would be established , which is to be commissioned to share social media citizens and citizens .
within six months with acceptance of the law would have to be able to register the user with their real name and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it be missed to do this , this may be a penalty of up to six months of prison or a fine of money .
the bill , consists of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is running on the internet and used to communicate with others through a voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear , as the draft is assumed , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities is currently able to register the useful and users of regi@@ ster@@ ing users , which is not able to sign up with the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .

this could mean that Egypt plans to judge a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to them , it would be necessary to submit to the Egyptians and Egyptians , to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are sk@@ ep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the prec@@ urs@@ day .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights , &quot; ) told by Global Vo@@ ices :
I doub@@ ts strong to the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are for@@ ci@@ ble physical public and private rooms that could be done online .
if I take it , then it means that they may apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizens , or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and to bring it to a court process .
that is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate .
whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful , or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , whose sen@@ ses is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different sc@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a Legislative Decree against Cy@@ ber crime , who was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who were found guilty of threat@@ ening &quot; public order to thre@@ aten &quot; and &quot; to protest to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq , the animal protection H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq have to protect the spiritual Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the bigger family of the Leop@@ ards , which led by Africa and Asia , are among the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to be found due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the fra@@ ction of their living space , as they always find less prey to end@@ anger@@ ed .
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian is the only remaining rob@@ ber@@ y in Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large room is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in fact is low and goes around zero . when the team therefore asser@@ ts that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera body , R@@ aza breaks out in a pure joy .
when educ@@ ated Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza , a different side of their country , which is not only the war and conflict exists .
it has been involved in field studies with wild living animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 , ensuring that protective zones for wildlife will be set up in the Kurdistan region .

early March 2017 , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o , the progress made in the past six years , were affected by the &quot; three @-@ cav@@ ity cat@@ astrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had the cat@@ astrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture , which pre@@ fecture Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture in Japan , which had both experienced the earthqu@@ akes and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had destroyed all the coastal cities of the map .
even that the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima experienced an atomic accident , so far alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o shows the progress made up six years after that progress has been reached in order to re@@ constru@@ ct the lives of the local authorities .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ building authorities as well as the survey results of the affected themselves .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( the end @-@ end , sa@@ w@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i saw the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures found Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened at 70 percent the final light .
it still lab@@ oured , even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ation of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ j@@ ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u were converted into final replacement houses .
after the triple cat@@ astrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation .
in December of 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such accommodation .
almost 40 per cent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lives in emer@@ gen@@ cies , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i were more successful there . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ees were settled in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald , were settled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the state of works and daily life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o @-@ Newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have been affected by evil , their doors opened until December 2016 , which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are back into operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation .
ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , have moved to the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ lands in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of land destroyed the farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lie in the &quot; nu@@ cl@@ ergy wave zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered far back , but also Fu@@ kus@@ hima remained unbe@@ aten here .
tourist tax in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 per cent at the same time as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can have only 75 percent .
however , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that almost half of the coastal inhabitants is almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to make their living .
is the native population prepared on the next big earthquake ?
to determine a total image , the newspaper conducted numerous evidence among the local population and below the evacu@@ ated by . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and as well as their indig@@ nation has changed over to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o conducted a survey conducted by more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
the survey presented that 8@@ 3.1 per cent of local residents , measures taken in order to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents have not yet done enough in terms of cat@@ astroph@@ es .
as to those who are evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture ,
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o @-@ Newspaper has also been strengthened its attention to the position of evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima did not only see the massive earthqu@@ akes and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also witness of the worst , disaster @-@ causing , nuclear accident , to the Japan ever .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima in a permanent replacement parts .
according to the 2017 state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in cat@@ astroph@@ ic areas , most of the Ev@@ acu@@ ated ones are still known in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald , older than 50 years old . they must compete for the re@@ building of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a building projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if you meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
after a while , however , one knows that one more bin@@ ds more than it seems at first sight .
these global compounds are important as they require our pre@@ ferences to enlarge our perspectives and recall that the world finally is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look forward to these global compounds . in our In@@ to the Deep po@@ d@@ cast we will treat issues that will often get less attention than they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember at a moment in which they have felt very strongly associated with someone in language and country limits .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ con@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Viol@@ eta Camar@@ asa re@@ members how the love of music worked in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time where they worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care centre . last Friday , a police officer in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia was defeated by a strike in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march towards au@@ ster@@ ity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
physicians operated him on Saturday and then put it into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread within a few days fast in Brazil .
on the pictures you can recognize the face of the police officers who identi@@ fies with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the preliminary service of the Order .
the pictures show the police officers , as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would be a police officer of a demonstr@@ ators and landing at the Inten@@ sive station , his face would be six months long on TV and the whole op@@ pression would be justified .

another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the below shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to stay one part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during the hospital .
&quot; be vali@@ ant , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing was shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political power : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was assassin@@ ated to his father , because he was attacked the Occup@@ y movement of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group . here we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who was attacked by a polic@@ emen who was attacked by a polic@@ emen who struck him with a stroke .
police transferred to police
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to protest@@ ers during the last Friday .
police officers were sitting at the protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
members of the Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again the Brazilian media of protests cap@@ turing the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window plate .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a frag@@ ile glass window to make sure to look around with a photo their title pages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; contrast , the O Glob@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preferred a title story with a set of brand new &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window plate than the protests thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing to report .
it is necessary to recogn@@ ise that if you are stri@@ ped against any form of non @-@ damage .
here , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an ab@@ sur@@ d , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate significance , and the typical violent actions of the military police will be caused by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ation course with the police . &quot;
the villages of det@@ oxi@@ dis@@ ing villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso closed almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the Gregorian parish church Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i , which is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as a Central Central and Spanish Sug@@ ar mill - regardless of that there is no significant sugar @-@ harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane fabri@@ c@@ ites have been laid .
following the result , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the report was left of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to be re @-@ found .
some change the work .
others signed and comm@@ utes daily for factories which still grin@@ d .
N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar pipe industry never screw@@ ed to his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the region sugar cane factories , which are back into operation after long in@@ active days , because they have been preserved .
that was something that he was not expected .
N@@ ene is sure to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would get the sugar cane Factory , but that promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resistance the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , poor administration and climate change .
in 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity .
the news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad harvest is no longer a new question .
why was the Cub@@ an Sug@@ gest@@ ion Industry ?
the old platform of the community saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the cr@@ ushing of the sugar cane industry was economic need : the 155 sugar cane fabri@@ cation were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive , they were not competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased to roughly one decade ago .
between 2017 and 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar level would generate at about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything ran well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day will go with safety into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the Gregorian pipe factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene is known as a soldier , talking about the closure of the factory , the word that he is repeated , &quot; fr@@ aud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group .
prior to the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially registered documents , which would only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed , add@@ res@@ sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could serve any removal of withdrawal .
from there the responsibility of responsibility and letters were always more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for the shut @-@ off factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for those in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years waiting for retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was in charge of his will at the stand@@ still of the factory , whose construction he helped , took part in it .
with each part , which he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial sector in Cuba and the most important work@@ pieces was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases there were no alternatives to work and services that gen@@ ated the plants in the churches , in which they were created .
we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw , when he guaranteed that factories had not been in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closing of the sugar tube factory
since 2004 , sugar cane has only been extracted high due to mice .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the People &apos;s Con@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i learned that many things are changing , but not always to make a factory when a factory is closed .
when the sugar pipe factory ended , or better , when they began to paint them , they also stopped to asph@@ alted the road , this also under@@ stands other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they have been spare parts .
without future perspective , many young people left the region again .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
nin@@ ety @-@ forty of the old soldiers bring to the old soldiers a two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I .
LORD N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is no follow@@ er person , yet he gives the lies that told him not .
they have been tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years of age , not because it is lacking in power , but because he is bitter .

first Nations you@@ ths use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express yourself and maintain their own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
yo@@ ungst@@ ers of the first Nations communities in the whole of Canada have to deal with topics that are important for them . they do with Hi@@ p @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour we have been introducing mobile Ton@@ studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the Ped@@ agogues David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ Group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop thus increases that young particip@@ ates in convers@@ ations topics such as &quot; cultural Ident@@ ity , Language , Dest@@ roy , Love , Self @-@ acceptable , &quot; or whatever is happening in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the yo@@ ungst@@ ers are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Y@@ oo in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the history of highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway from tears , &quot; on which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were not resolved .
the next video of Nem@@ k@@ hi Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate , as important of the receipt of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of global@@ ization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the people of the First Nations have not always been mut@@ iny @-@ speaking .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation will be recorded , the refra@@ in will be sung on cre@@ e .
the participating young people involved something from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group who gave them a stand in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the st@@ rop@@ he is available in the heading , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel that nobody would be interested in me
but I try to go on the earth my days
that is the day when you will take our cri@@ es .
because we lost our way in life as a youth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that we will rise up one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so you can grow and lead them as well as our youth
so you can do it , as determined by the Creator

in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers that is exactly on the menu will be seen in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( in the end , the &quot; Plastic Models of the dishes &quot; ) are issued by any food that will be served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a variety of these small enterprises that produce those plastic dishes made by the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese people are these plastic dishes so usually that they don &apos;t have any more to everyone . a new trend , however , is turned into con@@ current cell accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome , the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos depic@@ ting this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic geri@@ es decorated cell@@ ars , such as they are shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed to a kit@@ ten collection , as in this case , cool@@ ers :
here are a few Sho@@ es cool@@ ers for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of Essen@@ ti@@ ers will increase increasingly .
in this case , an imper@@ ial @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone support .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
we have also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that contains your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s only the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ic .
some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon are used , a popular T@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who say to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can emb@@ race my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appet@@ ite form to surprise for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile phone support has the shape of sch@@ mel@@ on ice .

in reports and foreign media about the inf@@ am@@ ous &quot; struggle against drug trading &quot; in Mexico the mis@@ si@@ sts and cas@@ ks regularly appear in statistics . however , these things do not reflect the extent of human tragedy that brings this battle with itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ al@@ oa cartridge , pressed the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , barely any man looks at the g@@ rief or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each surro@@ che , behind each bone remains in the hundreds of secret graves , stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug sales &quot; ) , that they should give a voice and told stories of people in the fight between prosec@@ utions authorities and cart@@ ons .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as :
organized crime may not only be afraid of our lives .
the consequences are much more pro@@ found .
for example , if businesses are close because they are threatened by drug tra@@ ders and all congregations will need to drive many kilometers in order to buy something as milk as milk .
the Pain of Vic@@ tims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( german : &quot; how fear live &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who sear@@ ches every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her neph@@ ew .
priest : &quot; like every Sunday , we also prepare ourselves again to the task that we have started to go and go to graves after the people who we loved , we are looking for . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he was again back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now with three children who need a education .
there is also my mother , who is also with me here .
at the moment she has no income .
you will be the insurance of my father , but they won &apos;t pay it out because they demand a dying .
where should we get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those that are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state guide .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some ex@@ cer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Gu@@ err@@ ero .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal than normal , in which form it occurs :
I have now known illness and Sens@@ ation journ@@ alism now for some years .
I pass every day at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with pictures , which actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from ac@@ companies of specialists .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes I feel the feeling when I am the only one I was wi@@ ther or sad . it works as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I can not be valid , or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin th@@ inks that he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders , when they go through the streets .
for me it is that , when they had lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened to them too .
I see our weakness if stories come to blo@@ om numbers in a statistics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the belief of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village that they had been justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to talk to that they are spar@@ ed by such a tragedy if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of press@@ ings in the Main region : &quot; as a family with thre@@ ats were pl@@ under . &quot; it describes how the armed crime month paid for month money from their business , until they had not only destroyed the business , but also her family had torn apart .
you think all that you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never goes on , the trau@@ ma remains high , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , telephone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
we further away from each other , the better .
she completed its report with the words :
we want that the others are arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they run or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would solve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot to live how to live . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he th@@ rows questions on how : who car@@ es for the child of a mixed woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime ?
how is it , in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells himself that he had to kill himself , how to make a egg co@@ cht , potatoes ro@@ ar , Tort@@ illas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ ac@@ on with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left B@@ one - one for each year of life .
but they are ir@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother be gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years ago , when he had seen only a few blocks from his home , the bloody Lei@@ che of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a pre @-@ driving car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was as follows :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence caused by the organized crime and the struggle against existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of the civil council for public security and the government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor counted 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories who organized the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories are still alive in view of the new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who we don &apos;t forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 established the data journ@@ alism project , whose aim is to observe the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in compreh@@ ension way .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this article and the pages , to which it is represented , contain images , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment in which it comes to lift a rum@@ or or to de@@ formation a f@@ ake .
but how is the year after the first time emerged ? content in social media , whether it is true or un@@ true , tend to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it has been util@@ ised as a dec@@ eption which took place in Nigeria or Myanmar since its first publication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this false copy of image and event - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false description &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false context &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - deny not the fact that there are plenty of more careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it th@@ rows questions about our desire to search for pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker crossed the place of S@@ ange in the East of the DR , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . 230 lives lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa had been neg@@ le@@ cted for years and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region were become dangerous cl@@ ads filled with impact holes that were difficult to ride .
the crane fell to the victim of the tank wagon .
the government representatives described a fire ball , the dozens of houses included , including a cinem@@ as near , that was full of people who illustr@@ ate the soccer world championship .
the houses so@@ jour@@ ned and shortened bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to in@@ firm@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ic Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple photos of the occurr@@ ence form the grey scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example .
it displays rows of carbon@@ ized bodies that are rounded up on the ground during the persons .
but here the history does not find their end .
over the years the same photo was wi@@ ped out several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but are not true , however , in the context of the trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the indigenous villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of grass , of which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained to count to count , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were ru@@ ined , shot or burned .
only from satellite images could be presented in the following time .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am , to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture of the DR Congo again appeared as proof of the fact , and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image of the DR of DRC is only one in a series of failure ; Africa Check has documented assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was introduced as a cover for mass@@ acres .
another step further bring personal comments like this example , from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also occurred in conjunction with the dead@@ ly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee hits , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s reported as the following that these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo gathered together :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page that took part in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein was told , mon@@ ks and politicians had involved in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the picture of the DR Congo to convert these information .
the original membership , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations which AF@@ P were named as their source , had also attributed to His statement too , but did not see the picture of the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupling sizes up to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere in all over the world .
using a &quot; inver@@ ted picture search &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded .
a converted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to the reported picture of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed the wrong reports , others have attempted to viol@@ ate the counter@@ f@@ ences .
we have sent some examples of the mis@@ im@@ aging use and to them in conjunction with the respective countries , based on which page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the reach than by the language alone .
several examples of ab@@ uses are linked to the listed countries ( in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be split yet ( on the map in orange ) :

Myanmar , 2017 .
in Myanmar , the government of Myanmar published a right position as &quot; inten@@ tionally , breaking news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding in terms of Myanmar . &quot;
this right position , which is published only in English , contains references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of rum@@ ours that are operated and used by extrem@@ ist groups to kill Muslims Budd@@ hist@@ s and elsewhere ( which is often used by bur@@ ial national@@ ists ) .

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodo@@ x community , clearly states that the picture of the DR of the DRC does not seem to kill the Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein was granted in 2012 that Mon@@ ks and politicians had been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story with the picture of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication is the picture included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture is not taken by the red@@ ness , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ av@@ ory attack . &quot;
as the picture later , in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to contra@@ di@@ ct that there was connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fertilizer y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and replaced a discussion on Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the stop on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities found this events that took place in the Islam@@ ist name , took place greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was wi@@ dowed for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times save ) . but the messages that were associated with them were taken in no religious context .
instead , the target , attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reports in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a message that allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the n@@ ig@@ eri@@ an massacre had been written , in circulation , there were discussion for@@ ums like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the embassy that included the image from the DR Congo , the organization of Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
at other accounts , generators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ an also has no longer tra@@ ce@@ ability : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and Time / Dat@@ st@@ amping stamp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler and moved them via image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which had appeared only after the original accident of 2010 , the image finally might be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that drag them through . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of bigger discussions about silence in connection with Muslims , or - for the defense of Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how a African life is evaluated in comparison with a European or French life .
religion understanding and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images can be used in connection with these efforts .
but a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can &apos;t give this pictures longer .
with social media there are funny people who have un@@ intended to comfort the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ars this mood are mis@@ erable and fal@@ seh@@ ood , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tast@@ es the actual gro@@ ove of what actually happened in the DR , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
dis@@ sem@@ ination images have already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the re@@ tention of pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al does come to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims itself .
at the same time , the concern is that for@@ ci@@ ble images and spectators des@@ per@@ ate and gave them the ability to feel emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , seeking to help others to help others ) .
whereas there are a lot regarding violent represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact is that it is indisp@@ ens@@ able for the present news report .
Techn@@ ologist experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will thoroughly re@@ consider the situation in which an image can be interpreted in which it is actually replaced by the context or completely mis@@ used by the context or completely mis@@ used species .
each examination should be considered as internationally as international .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. ir@@ re@@ plac@@ eable ) ende@@ av@@ oured to offer a variety of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to transl@@ ate .
such words are available in each language : you press some situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able words are already well @-@ known ( as the famous Portuguese acid ) and others are ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist obst@@ inate any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient , why a full explanation and sometimes something is required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
this unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists by Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u office , as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ ent your parents in recognition of how to have lab@@ oured in thy younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;

like Sri Lanka with the worst fl@@ ashing disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka currently sees the worst flood disaster in this decade compared to the worst flood disaster .

after a position of Sri Lanka &apos;s disaster of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the tur@@ keys and sl@@ ud@@ ge .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe accommodations .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water circumstances went back slowly .
health and hygiene requirements of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos have an impression of the extent of the Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ astrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ i and Sri Lanka are providing regular updates for flood situation .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
using En@@ ig@@ t.@@ Dam@@ als in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbouring and love @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
I trust me my four year old daughter , and trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute , we call par@@ ols for the rights of women .
in the next we add rights to Trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of rain@@ bow and people , some keep the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound up from a American flag , other sk@@ ill@@ ings par@@ ols against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend looks at me , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not affect you , or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ h@@ a ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
people who have been working or people who have been working for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built themselves in their performance .
they mus@@ cl@@ ed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all alike .
we practic@@ ed our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different art . but somehow we are all connected to the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective presentation , that as soon as Muslims who do not pur@@ ify there .
will be dischar@@ ged
so I &apos;m not alone .
that is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come in one in the sense when you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I am now , he was a Orthodox Muslim Pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , Kor@@ an , and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western presentation , religion Rum@@ is was deleted as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another exists in the re@@ trac@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , the Western books already colonial since centuries .
this entic@@ ing image language is determined by the dark man that should be afraid , and the exotic woman that you should save .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid in the 1970s the history behind these pictures .
but these pictures are also forward today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood they continued .
I &apos;ve been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , incorrect sc@@ ents domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v transfer the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades , while the USA could not choose their first female presidential candidate in the USA in 2016 .
this Nar@@ rati@@ onal refuse to recogn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are forced to wear their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover Saudi women through their government to cover their entire body , which both are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this powerful Nar@@ rati@@ onal weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it shows that the first Muslim prayers had been spoken to the American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which were brought together with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has led us deep and faul@@ ty , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become the target of tim@@ us@@ li@@ stic attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ations .
because of these stories , which we tell us and due to the species , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also do fol@@ ks that help us understand the world .
and my industry is advis@@ able to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ ham@@ mer@@ ed Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jew@@ ellery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ per was made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan &apos;s sky@@ lines of the world were re @-@ thought , my parents were untreated Muslims and Americans .
but am I now overcome , Mus@@ lim@@ a and American woman ?
sometimes , if people ask me , why I don &apos;t get pork , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or get my hand@@ ful T@@ ash@@ ore that are all Muslims - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I sh@@ ear , we don &apos;t wear all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
we also need to be a the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or in order to be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists , and religious activists who ende@@ av@@ our to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ treated Islam@@ ists , think tanks and experts for fal@@ low information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or of which Islam is manip@@ ulated .
because of the stories that we tell us and tell us , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in more than just a stranger , who breaks the head .
or as the terri@@ fying card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole States , see below .

I want to explain that .
I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a mus@@ cul@@ a was born until I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
when social schol@@ ars describe religious life , they look back to the following terms : believe , Beh@@ avi@@ or and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend would see my neigh@@ bor , my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the fire that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a , when they look through the 15 meters of concrete and air which can separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ u@@ ary rit@@ ual with my daughter when I kept it in my poor and her Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an , and the Q@@ ul@@ s are called .
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pray you , that it is being protected from evil , the evil which you can see and the evil man that can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men do not weep , but at the same time I cri@@ es to my grandfather .
stop@@ over during he writes books about the modern Islam and about independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan , who ruled her family in India , who ruled the family in a half century not into its arms .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families were like in my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists , who have dealt the Muslim world like the game .
Mus@@ lim@@ a is to know that in the last two centuries of Europeans all Europeans have colon@@ ized by four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means that the first spru@@ ce of history was cast out of history before a century over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an in@@ dish , k@@ ash@@ ore under British imperi@@ alism , called it as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he was the first mosque in England .
even before the aircraft , he travelled to more parts of the world when I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ate has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means that when a tragedy has come home to the USA , and the susp@@ ects named a Muslim name , the history four times more reported as a story with a white attack .

structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regi@@ sters which began with President Bush and was widened under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immig@@ rants , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists of a country that includes its borders opposite people from just across the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arab@@ s and Muslims .
we are the wars that we lead and cast bombs to the Muslim countries .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep , to be a Muslim or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we &apos;re back for decades to recogn@@ ise the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous prints , which we stopped in our news editorial operations .

initiative for nar@@ rative Art to preserve Urban Language diversity
number of history count , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way , here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone to enter into the connection ?
Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the stories of stories in their original language is a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported a brief initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ ex@@ changeable blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve the language variety of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the children born there .
the project is valid for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we assume cities that accept di@@ vers@@ ity - safe environments where people do not forget to belong to these .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they often listen to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hear these events &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to feel to feel to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , history counter will initially represent its history in their own language and transl@@ ate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional history of history , their dev@@ otion and their representation is that the list@@ ens will be on it .
they call laugh@@ ter and emotions appearing , the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the history of history , R@@ assi@@ op@@ ou outlines the opportunity to explain the country &apos;s typical customs of customs .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the fjord from the bun@@ ni@@ es and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he explained the meaning of his fing@@ ern@@ ity , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in , he divi@@ des his feeling of in@@ breeding :
you have heard it !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
to date , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can organize with T@@ LS in contact to organize your own story guides .
Puerto Rico calls for the state of state debt by the USA
with the aim of a revision of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amount to USD 72 million on April 3rd , 2017 , several religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ian Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the neur@@ on of the debt ) and the Ec@@ ological Church of Puerto R@@ os .
the advoc@@ ate of the new debt of debt also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os calls for the politicians , banks and government agencies that are responsible for debts of their corruption .
we call for a financial examination and a tap committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding re@@ mun@@ eration that is in favour of the economy .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ os refused to pay a debt that is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers are not to be found with sin@@ king retirement .
we require immediate action .
the island - not into the state @-@ established integrated territ@@ orial territory of the United States - is suffering under a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the state of state .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto R@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
the measures imposed by the exter@@ mination of the citizens without the participation and over@@ coming of the citizens of the citizen shall be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nach@@ watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the sy@@ ring@@ @-@ Palestinian Web developers Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for more than one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and the campaign for his freedom continue and remember the contributions which he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference for digital culture that is held annually in Berlin , dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the France resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , l@@ ases from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ ch ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is licensed here , contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression .
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to create movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are associated with which this is associated .
activ@@ ist , artist , designers , developers , researchers , researchers , researchers , who are involved in movements for free knowledge , have been working on page to view over the fog who gives our news@@ feeds to create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of A@@ dra prison , which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or position .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that want to release on his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel has a high price for its participation in a free culture , has many of us start to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , acts and decisions .
why are we now here ?
what to do we have decided ?
what do we have given extreme belie@@ fs in this process ?
since March 2012 , the website for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution which was transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , writer and lawyer in N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Based on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; was taken from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by individuals on 12 November 2015 , having set themselves on the Insider of the Assad government and set them in an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his position and condition remain un@@ unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in making access to the Internet and to know the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently transfer the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the bass prototypes were predic@@ tive than the work that he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ constru@@ ct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ wise of numerous civilians and are mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ ber@@ y traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture , not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world em@@ bodies .
this striking train is created in the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be the public to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of an estimated value .
however , Bas@@ sel was able to un@@ lock this project so far .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dream of liberty and Bash@@ an taught me to emb@@ race them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bash@@ sel brought me English to me , even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read English well , writing and speak English .
he always has his knowledge with everyone who asked him . he taught other in@@ quiries to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened me the gateway to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought the Internet to me .
he had also taken other in@@ war@@ ns , as they use computer at least theore@@ tically , without that they actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
they tast@@ ed the lyrics when they visited him , and he translated them from the Arab in English .
the book is licensed freely .

here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it is happening in each visit ,
that I hide in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the sprinkl@@ ing in the moment , in which we are poor ,
that each of the d@@ angers is no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , bo@@ ilers and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the pris@@ ings of the pris@@ ons
and I dr@@ ens in every detail of your voice and words
I bear with my passion ,
if your eyes say empty
and I lay another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments ,
and over thy absence to weep and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
one year is going , my soul
during the
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of the monster
bass story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ets has gone over 65@@ ,000 people according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or executed by the regime through the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many further people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community calls on the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today we repeat this demand in hope we need to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption prosec@@ ut@@ ted director returned to the previous post
Moz@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted with wrath on a corruption , in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state of the government , in which the corruption was committed .

the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council was CFO Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and asked immediately his re@@ setting to the company what happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which imp@@ acted the request , there would be no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , again to relate to his old post since the company was no discipline proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants are not good .
the Centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution which conven@@ es for public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to set up the director in an interview with the Deutsche Welle :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a decline in relation to the efforts of our legal systems , so the C@@ IP .
what we have to know is that the company should have had a discipline trial against access .
however , the company apparently seems to be adequate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behaviour also as &quot; contra@@ di@@ ally &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and to have taken half of it .
he could have paid lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ ech@@ es , he might be advised and polishing his image .
but as he is in@@ competent , he has vent@@ ured to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is being paid for his silence .
resist@@ ible !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ que and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not matter any mur@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state , because he didn &apos;t believe him , that one has rewarded him to such a way that has already been rewarded so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ally to return and to serve the state , * he had already served as a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only himself served by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was used to use the state as a hand@@ some of an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money @-@ source and the state itself is tired of this man we@@ ari@@ ed and sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this guy was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief belongs to the prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , will not only remain as the first independent President in memory , but also as a sharp , conc@@ ision , and - next to the proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous written represent@@ ations , when he was energet@@ ically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , even the father@@ land for its amb@@ itions , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he turns not from his amb@@ itions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is de@@ crimin@@ ated simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also dis@@ closure :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and was free .
and today , the company reli@@ es on him again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pav@@ is - Dis@@ cipl@@ ine ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to iniquity
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ ies .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their post to the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although over the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian source , or in general as ad@@ j@@ ec@@ tively . &quot;
Facebook dis@@ ates the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or , ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hass@@ tongue in Burma in the social network .
in the last few years , the rise of radical national@@ ist movements has given an extreme se@@ wer@@ ed k@@ onn@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word which is mostly used by ultra @-@ national@@ ists as Hass@@ elt against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat Hass@@ elt in Myanmar , the company has licensed a lot of sen@@ su@@ al content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism in connection , but the Word of itself does not call automatically Hass@@ elt .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even Post@@ s , in which they have discussed the use of the word or doub@@ ts for purposes of his use , have been cen@@ sored .
in addition there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same book sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair at Bur@@ m@@ ese also wrote &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( &apos; aging ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on the spiritual way , if they might know how he could lin@@ king his back pain when he made a word .
the sentence K@@ U la - &quot; Cure &quot; ( K@@ U ) + the fra@@ ction ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - similar to the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that they must decrease in Hass@@ elt &apos;s radical national@@ ists , but also stressed that fac@@ ial must be analy@@ tic before it spread all the postcards that are out in the suspic@@ ion of pure , rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you want to write on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
in fact , what it should do , it is carefully to analyze and control it by checking the refer@@ enced words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chips ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these three @-@ star national@@ ists are spread of Hass@@ elt , a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their national@@ ism .
while the action is going to send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ sem@@ inate Hass@@ elt , may not keep the efficiency of this strategy .
the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship is often getting a K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users social networks can simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the scen@@ ic word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his post when he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was attention to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the Word is closed .
Iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and to me the li@@ ken , post and share of contents for 24 hours , because the post &quot; the Facebook community standards cannot be ent@@ eous . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of postcards from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or simply try to show their opinions against Hass@@ elt &apos;s radical national@@ ists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , who has nothing to do with Hass@@ elt :
post without Hass@@ elt from Facebook .
in the post , the author divided his opinion , why extreme national@@ ism and religious foundations were badly in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have to do more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community concerns :
Facebook likes to have a beneficial intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform but it does not work .
such words leads only more hat@@ red within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support , as words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ an curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they did not have error , they didn &apos;t tried to report the due post .
if they had only some respect for the 15 million benefits , which would have a big turnover , would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has drawn up for a lot of sk@@ iers under the users .
instead of serious , users are now funny via Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ elt to see if their posters will be taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook &apos;s , which had no hate @-@ language , but nevertheless removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch the pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch a Indian film .

the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;

in the last five years , extreme national@@ istic Ide@@ ologies and religious fundam@@ ent@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ elt is to heat the violence in the churches in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , especially in the region of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands of escape .
on Facebook , Facebook has been critic@@ ized to his bur@@ ial sites , critic@@ ized a crit@@ erion for his bur@@ ial sites .
but rather than simply did the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; too , it would have been better to have been closer to context than concentr@@ ating on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is at the end with the child
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament &apos;s parliament unanimously decided to offer a law that this practice is to offer , so that the age of married is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the husband , some members were du@@ istic and Muslim religi@@ ons at the practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , that the state should not mix , because that the state didn &apos;t determine the maturity . &quot;
this happened un@@ expect@@ edly the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN children &apos;s rights , the min@@ ors as , and every man under 18 years of age .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 there were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Central Central Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media mot@@ ions that ende@@ av@@ ai@@ ved , laws to the child before , followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support . und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly , they continue to support this result .
nevertheless , everything was smooth .
an Hin@@ du guide , e. g. had no concerns to say the critics of the children before , they should be dam@@ ned by their own matters . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition was actually used for st@@ resses in this actually un@@ complicated thing and sometimes came doub@@ ts on whether the Opposition would agree to the bill of the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the child before - despite 4 trans@@ formers ( including one woman ) of the opposition and an independent , that abst@@ ained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him to do it .
now , only the President of the country has to agree and preach the law .
one of the country &apos;s trans@@ formers have been released on Facebook with Facebook Update , Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill against the Children &apos;s bill was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes against it and none .
after having decided previously in the Senate , the draft can now be transferred to the law .
the majority of social media users was thr@@ illed because the laws have been last changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who dressed a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary sc@@ ede , which has swal@@ low the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the child is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s almost every prize .
while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excellent news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for that - 0 ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ding Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that is quite open to it , how important is the adoption of the law , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft summary was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and 35 of them were present at the voting .
all members elected to the law have approved for the law .
the children &apos;s before is not allowed to be legally allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # demolished .
many thanks to all activists who have made him out .
congratulations to our congratulations .
a thank you to our members .
but there is a possible hook in the form of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country .
prior to months Mah@@ ar@@ aj has announced its intention to companies the judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and it seems to resol@@ ve his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a disc@@ er@@ ent of the law said it was quite lawful if Mah@@ ar@@ aj was accused against the law , most social media users would be subject to the debate on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
Dear Sat , if we are instead of talking about discussion so generally , in a way that we need to talk the state in our bedrooms , simply specifically talk about it that they may be mis@@ used by major , persistent males who are ab@@ used to them compared with their advantage , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial accus@@ ation against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children is legal or remains the norm , although there are laws that they may instru@@ ct them .

Turkish users can view Wikipedia content through the mirrors of websites
the Wikipedia page was published on January 18 , 2012 , and to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright law in the USA , internationally dar@@ kened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month , Turkey opened the popular and on the crowd sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tag for day is clear how important the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both students as well as re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV series watches against pl@@ u@@ cle@@ ation .
although many technical users are used to block space tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times , that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most of the ordinary Wikipedia are not in this category .
although Turkey has been un@@ locked by Wikipedia , as recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , you will find regular block@@ ations of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the most massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform still remains closed , there are several Mir@@ ror@@ sides ( pages which reflected the contents of Wikipedia and often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform submitted all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able in spite of the legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post report IP@@ FS about his efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( via the wave of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to read snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can not reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS also gave that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and only for screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the sperm .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sun@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ ach@@ .org , an open source project that everyone can use such Mir@@ ror@@ sides to ho@@ ist when in the respective country Wikipedia is closed .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror .
it is ri@@ p@@ ens on another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server guides the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are blocked in Turkey .
because this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese Wild@@ animal photographer uses his camera to be atten@@ tive to the necessity for nature conservation
a su@@ hl@@ p rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo of S@@ um Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
S@@ um Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were w@@ ned with po@@ or@@ ly positioned mot@@ ives and balanced colors .
this motiv@@ ated him to bear a camera to try and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
at that time he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , he ende@@ av@@ oured to bring Nept@@ une , Nep@@ as animal world to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that guides the attention of Nep@@ als wildlife .
he described on Facebook , how this first @-@ class location helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what might be better for a passionate game photograph@@ ers ! !
I just rested from home , when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the Manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida ) , he had received a call from my father that would have been a Leopard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I tried with my camera and was there in few minutes .
my father loved him , and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was found and I immediately began to look back images too ! !
s@@ ooth@@ ills a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition of Nep@@ als nature and would like to understand the understanding that wild animals are not so fear@@ ful as they look like .
and he should know , because he had already stood by face to face to face :
a tiger can not distur@@ b your flocks by the opinion of sheep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
also I was because of darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately tells us , and let us go through the S@@ al @-@ Tre@@ es ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ays placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he was waiting for 22 days , and lived in a tent to take in Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live in the vicinity of the tourist information .

years after the wedding , there were Indian women for the first time to discuss the name of their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was released here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , there are women with greatest care to discuss the names of their hus@@ bands , or even from older men in the family .
instead they use a Pr@@ inters or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ ec@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect them as well as fear of the social pressure , as well as fear of consequences they should preserve the norm .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted by the Indian State of O@@ stra@@ a by a head@@ court and by her family and the village community after she had spoken a secret relationship with names .
the tradition of her marriage did not believe in the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able to fear , if ever , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health care as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main focus of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the host@@ ile of the patri@@ arch@@ ate alone .
as one of 56 clubs , which there are in 13 Indian countries , it is part of the campaign # K@@ help Bad@@ al that is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and reli@@ es on the dismant@@ ling of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s home to the ban of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these cl@@ ubs .
it reports how these clubs were created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time for ambassador of the mur@@ al .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round , tra@@ ded by women who do not name their hus@@ bands on their name .
she decided to have op@@ ted for this subject , because they wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves .
not according to the names of their hus@@ bands , there is a ro@@ man that they pleaded not guilty to all the dem@@ nity , and have never been question@@ ed in question .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman respec@@ ts her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t keep this , is regarded as a woman without morph@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never seen through this discussion round about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to never before her husband &apos;s name until now , at home , tried to try at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother in law is still long after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned back to me , saying , I should call him from now on his name .
this self @-@ confidence in the luggage started their first discussion club .
many women had ever heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after video projection the women tried to bring the discussion with a practice in gear .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant in the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , off@@ ended , sad , lov@@ ingly , and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want us , meaning that they would not respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was out of the village of Wal@@ vis in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which women never have married the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
one woman was so sh@@ y that during the whole exercise just before himself , a second decided to let the whole w@@ asted fru@@ stration against him and let his family leave to curse him .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it .
in addition to this , with an ancient fires , the women decided that they would actually try to try her husband at home to name her husband at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what the ideas answered the women in the head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name to say his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the entire family .
when her mother ex@@ hor@@ ted in law , she got afraid , and told that it was an error .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said &quot; I should do it . &quot;
an husband of an attendance was less intelli@@ gible and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the fasc@@ ination red spot on the fore@@ head , who shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the fasc@@ ination red point if he also died .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard that , to wear it .
the other women did not have to hear that , but mine , they are now in a better position , to choose it in some days not to wear .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip at each discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want that the women make sure what could hear what could hear , &quot; says it .
in the last months , she celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake ; she dan@@ ces and sang and talked about things that they had never done thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working for many years since so many years and yet I have had some things , for example , how our ident@@ ities are linked to our hus@@ bands , never hon@@ est hon@@ est .
it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have talking about the concept of honor , and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have been carried by Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most is the okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a long shirt over a tro@@ users , carry it not .
after a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of their own clothes , the mor@@ als are connected to the sar@@ is and much more , tast@@ ed cru@@ ini in a discussion round , so that women could bear them .
next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can take Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it .
on the question of whether in the five months has already been changed since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things begin to come into rolls :
we have made only small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but they list@@ ened to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; one or two women have now carry out Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot at their fore@@ head .
the women in discussion club know that the changes that they want to reach in their lives - how to get more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
by doing each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how raw ini declared :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman walks in the club home and others tell others what we speak and what we do .
we are all in the same boat .

another group , the aim of ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to that the UN 2016 in South Africa led a mission to investigate these practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and pre@@ ference .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably recently made recently .
this story was originally published on Hong Kong Free Press on 8 July 2017 .
the following version will be published within a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn up in the international community attention , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June , that he has been hosp@@ ital@@ ized due to liver cancer in the hospital &apos;s final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state end@@ anger@@ ed ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which calls the democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has declared Li@@ us case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man tells it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China still receives calls from the international community , Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , allow to allow for a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely excav@@ ated to the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has taken some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Z@@ eid Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met the fall of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
one spokes@@ person , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to allow for a treatment abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ø@@ r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came back to Sto@@ u after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 , although the Norwegian Government ha@@ sted that this was nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement in order to return to China , since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread the message that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an un@@ conditional release , and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to its imprisonment , he was not able to meet its price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , China also called Li@@ us to release Li@@ us as she was in a statement on 30 June :
we are at the same time that China lifts all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife , as well as family members .
they are to meet and receive all visits , who wish they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outer world .
USA
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that the Americans would like him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , unless it be possible to help him in his gen@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy must not allow the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the repe@@ ating of the US Embassy attracted a desert response from China to itself , with the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to make a unique and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple with :
protection and freedom such as travel accessibility and access to the medical care of its choice which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditional release .
I ur@@ ged China to release the Nobel Prize @-@ Lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditional , so that it can be kept in proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex could over@@ take care of Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on the 28th of June , the Canadian Ambassador , John Mc@@ Call@@ um , asked China to provide a reasonable medical care and to give him the opportunity to leave themselves out of his family .
Li@@ us An@@ w@@ alt told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in hospital , and that it is not permitted to talk with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact us .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you further :
Canada calls to China , its international human rights commitment , including the freedom of expression , to be true and used for the exercise of this rights .
France
in a statement on 29 June , French Foreign Ministry asked China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken in order to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments , which he , regardless where , is needed . furthermore , his wife and his family may have to contact him .
although the news broad@@ caster France Info reported that the French government li@@ u would be welcome in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced that there would be no further information , that France will eventually record him .
Taiwan
the Council of the Oc@@ cas@@ ions in Taiwan called for China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and require a larger tolerance towards those that require peace funds to demand political re@@ forms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u also called the China Democratic Party of the Democratic Party of China also called to allow an intellectual li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself very careful in a statement on June 28 at Li@@ u , and gave that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us Wellness .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith , that the initiatives that he took and kept strictly adher@@ ed to a harmon@@ ic , more stable and we@@ al@@ thy China , which again contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally very travels , and also encour@@ ages when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter of 8 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and law .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question might be stup@@ id , since Singapore is recognised as an independent state since Singapore .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered to be a city in Singapore .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting at the international bien@@ ni@@ al Association of the State of New York , the Minister , that many people critic@@ ized the Domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he under@@ support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has asked if New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people go to a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to turn the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and promises to create this valuable land , we hear that we &apos;re not going to be no country .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had the licence of a flight before the responsibility , a mandatory infr@@ in@@ gement .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons given by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very Nobel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of which he appeared un@@ certain un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally as well as cities that are permanently led to the party .
these cities are democr@@ atically .
as soon as you reach the subject of the subject , the good old Lei@@ er from the authorized distributors go to the pre @-@ release Democrats , leaving the turned logic , because they fit better to their power .
in the final day of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , we were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our J@@ udi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really not answers .
relevant questions will be rati@@ onal with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls to Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am on his opinion , because they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city is , so to which country belongs to our city ...
short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grat@@ eful if our wer@@ der K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would like to clari@@ fy this point if he was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog his comment posted on the reviews that you should start to read the entire co @-@ address of the conference , so that one could understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the inscription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore would be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated why the elections in Singapore would be so easy , even if we are looking forward to free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he moved Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said to Singapore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No land , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not sense to this meaning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes the leader in a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about that which said the Minister of Justice in Singapore ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and members of the old gar@@ de that awaits me - be understood with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubt and I am not even sure whether he really believes it , and is aware of what he is def@@ ending .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ lays the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am Arg@@ um@@ ni :
did Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; committed a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher spokes@@ man ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , in which country go back the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government Cab@@ in , the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious significance .
why do they live in their military service , they defend their city but not their country ?
who has to rep@@ ay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our rosa Personal@@ ized ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
if the Journey Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ ahu , Singapore is and always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have many more people more expensive ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak rather from the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked for recently his editors : what is the most disp@@ leased aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a ongoing series , revealed with the rum@@ ors over certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et will be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is set to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , and answer me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on which the situation takes place in the situation , it is considered to be pol@@ ite , interest in his conversation partners , providing personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on my clari@@ fication then the standard answer is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans have to cook for Americans , though they are kept for Americans , but me do not distur@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know itself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us the Canadian of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
by Americans , others ... .
so it was even when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans always have small car@@ hor@@ n@@ sheets of their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
the same sexual marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are saying very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups as a toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not like this type south of the border .
we are Canadian .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends that I ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would not make me nothing , if one would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fir@@ stly : as &quot; nice &quot; to be called , is basically to be noted , as the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but trag@@ ically significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing , at which one can meet .
be harm@@ less , is in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , from the things that happen around a round .
I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone to be one of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own matters .
the exceptional as &quot; nice &quot; signi@@ fy , is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
we l@@ acks warm heart@@ y , open kindness , which I connect to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au became the stage to show that Canadian player has more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has grown in Canada .
music video of a pop band in Thailand in Thailand
one in Thailand famous pop band has published a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which took power in 2014 and restore the civilian government despite their promises , continue to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells what regulations make him his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not explicitly polit@@ ically , the music video refers to the continued military su@@ prem@@ acy of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days , this was shared on Facebook by Facebook and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; dict@@ ator has been blocked in Thailand since a group of activists trained the public to view this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entert@@ aining introduction to Thai politics as well as it beha@@ ves in particular with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the videos which relate to some of the political issues that have been pursued in Thailand in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical Section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which the commander of the army command@@ ing an absolute decision on important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your setting &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the post @-@ war company recovered only very slow in East Asia , especially in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic still visible .
the abandoned villages of the northern part in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive paintings .
villages like D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal tanks of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ ies , Geor@@ g@@ iers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called spiritual ministry in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10.000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16,000 people , after it had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 , approximately 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ k@@ ow@@ k@@ az , are symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and quite rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk with you ? &quot; why ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile forsaken the district .
there are about fifty inhabitants in the town of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages to see it similar .
the Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ ow@@ kas that can accommodate one or two families , one recogni@@ zes about the balconies , where linen is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look at the windows of a destroyed house .
when she will discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother is forbidden to photograph us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed with her gir@@ l@@ friend and suddenly abandoned the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the subject industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for own demand ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable building .
it &apos;s difficult to come about the laps .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ ini . &quot;
about ten years ago , a older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to the jung@@ le ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ ch@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia , &quot; says it .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial assistance from her daughter , and insi@@ sted that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly rates are just 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden or a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is too expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet and celebrate public holidays regularly .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells their story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calling T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get to all things &quot;
Nat@@ asha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a couple of time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remin@@ is@@ cent of the village in front of the war .
in spite of the relatives published in Central Russia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the Land Ab@@ ch@@ Asia broke away ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought the country in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but it will take a little bit , &quot; explains it .
Nat@@ asha received approximately $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ ash@@ as children &apos;s garden was found once , they hold pigs , cows , h@@ uts and h@@ ens .
it tells you that it was initially a very anxi@@ ous situation when people left the village as many people after the war .
but in the course of time they lost their fears .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people .
you can get to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , however , it has somewhat to do with pill@@ age .
after the war there was hardly any work and all experienced as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day as the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our talk is ten@@ dered to the end , a little boy ended on us .
he runs through the windows of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out from the window and another boy ch@@ ased him .
he plays with the ball that sh@@ uts down the hill .
a group of children now persecuted the ball .
while they run , some of them cast stones onto the falling building .
these ruins are a part of her childhood which provide in@@ justice in their lives .
they don &apos;t know any different .

in Mexico , &quot; M@@ om Africa hosts &quot; Mig@@ rants on their long voyage
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants which cross Europe or Latin America , certain places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is guided by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink Br@@ ill@@ ary base and gold coloured ear stu@@ ds in t@@ ed@@ dy b@@ ular form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many among the name M@@ om Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) became a target for Afri@@ kaner and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , grinding , cr@@ um@@ bled walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of afri@@ can and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full mini@@ bus and from the upper part of the coast to call it : &quot; m@@ om Africa !
where are you my m@@ om Africa ?
at the moment , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have slept outside on cardboard .
she would like to re@@ ject us .
she also helps them , and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medicines that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time .
I asked him if Mama is a reasonable first name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ tened st@@ ache ) , with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits you , that African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels to Boston with his sister , hopes to go to Boston to return to her husband and her three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but is it for some Afri@@ cans , which are on the way to the United States , normally a first stop in South America and then turn to the north .
the family had heard from other tra@@ ilers of Mama Africa . &quot; M@@ om Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ kaner &apos;s often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App of Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his captivity , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builders on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy has been weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest in Mama Africa for the months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om Africa is our mother and we never leave it again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests often send text messages when they continued to gre@@ et them or to report about the course of their journey .
they declared that her Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught them to prepare chickens like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only radio hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a cu@@ l @-@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter was added to Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the Bust@@ ick@@ ets are sold to numerous African migrants .
he began to help them to receive an appropriate prize , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 persons , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on bl@@ ank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ ery outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells me . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and help others . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his place .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of the people who wanted to rep@@ lied with him without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a sole , has offered him a roof .
a few months later the family lives and try to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , the trav@@ ellers are quiet their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has spent 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nost@@ al@@ g@@ ically , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she fl@@ ashed her in her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair@@ dressing , which you made a sp@@ ine , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laugh@@ ed at her , while she briefly presented her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they are already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a Check @-@ Point for personal communication appliances in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users en@@ quired period .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users received a mobile phone in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a mobile phone notification in which she shows the District government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the notification , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities , however , has the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women have been arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture because they had previously installed the app , messages with a private we@@ aving group .
in the notification of the police , the app stand that the app and the distribution of the terror@@ ists would determine and persec@@ ute , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; dam@@ aging information , &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service system with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web@@ pages , by online fr@@ aud , Tro@@ ians and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users attention to make sure how much time they spend online , and control your own home network .
this app with fil@@ tering for min@@ ors shall help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can naturally be used in a variety of ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; or even h@@ acker able to manip@@ ulate home network to manip@@ ulate or steal home network .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while announ@@ cements concerning digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focused on the experiences of users in the major cities in the East and South , the reality is much often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit the rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme poverty and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet banking .
based on Twitter @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; images from the China &quot; ( current survey ) , which was cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos of a Check@@ point where the polic@@ emen have subsequently checked the residents when they had the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered on a Check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a blow for technological development .
you are forced to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the Republic of China &quot; ( en@@ ligh@@ tened ) , in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ product description published that the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus obtain un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang will be easy to use in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city party , to minim@@ ize illegal contents .
all government branch , authorities and associated facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office when running their computer and communication appliances .
a recent report from Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the assignment to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell@@ phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media cards &quot; by local police .
the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy them . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other potential income , including such that refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all cri@@ es after death
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ cli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activity of Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and setting that you &apos;re very alone at a place where everything has disappeared .
everything has been dissolved after and after dis@@ band@@ ed and a truth , which is clearly visible , both from inside and outside .
one who makes her name &quot; glory . &quot;
one that caused itself into a list of skir@@ ting and squ@@ ee@@ zing the met@@ aph@@ ors that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you come back the reality , and go behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all of doubt dissolve itself in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the Un@@ sanctified . you will clear that you are caught between the walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they did me and I was arrested three times , but that was not enough to prove my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security services formulated it - with that promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he wrote his power against us by doing even the most influ@@ ential concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protests like the dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was sufficient to break the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the quarters were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , in the wrong time , even if I put no high demands to a city which is to be stack@@ ed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their complic@@ es .
in the third night , things had something cal@@ med up after the power supply stopped in the district .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I crossed the silence when I cried out several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice through silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends have joined me ; we were able to send us a splendid picture , which was full of expectations and totally filled .
in such a moment , you are aware that you have delivered the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the upri@@ ghts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you ready to meet us at the military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can submit - nothing can return to you your voice , after you got the way up to the office of the safety service from the body .
I came there .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear , as you are called &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only cour@@ age@@ ous enough to cry when we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes set up for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you don &apos;t g@@ rief to see me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , did not do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was sure that I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I have never heard you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation , which could have such fat@@ ale consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regre@@ t the word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in sol@@ itary and his father equally with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father equally with it . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this cursed pro@@ claim is in my nose today until today .
he became one of &quot; syndrome , &quot; an ep@@ ic torture that I had been exposed to months .
I am cri@@ es out the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything back with me .
thereafter again by the farm and into the second office that leads through a gear to the single cells .
I &apos;m looking forward to me all the details before I support the room .
otherwise they have assigned a larger cell for me this time .
I have to share it with only one other prisoner and may immediately set me immediately , without any permission to wait .
after some minutes , which felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I handle on an old well @-@ proven communication method : with the f@@ ist to beat the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell fin had a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ain@@ ee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time he responded to me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells , there was a respected male aged @-@ old age , which is similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there are no striking fac@@ ulties , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone else , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers connected to its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would not leave him if I remain .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
glad@@ ly would have had a bird @-@ h@@ ors to distribute all these cranes that lab@@ elled on the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I hear them still &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be at least 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the colour of the sk@@ ating is , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the tomb in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; play on 13th of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the secret to protect the secret security against us and prevent the betra@@ yers and the terror@@ ists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ty dial@@ ect - so they played their cont@@ emp@@ tive replacement card and the close eye view of their world view .
this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call Ko@@ existing in order to transform the crime of their sound into a hero .
I cared for the hearing and meet to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he will come to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ vers@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions that you are still young , you can join so much more important with your life when you join this day@@ time and to protest demonstrations , that will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I answered not .
I did not acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer me .
I really can &apos;t say more exactly what vou@@ chers and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation for me became a common communication tool .
when and how it happened , it was not important .
any voice in me said that I had to be acc@@ ust@@ omed to me or disp@@ leased , although I had nothing done to earn this sentence .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to rip myself as much meat as possible from the body .
he called the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably originates from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker will learn to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you will not withdraw your cry .
my cri@@ es were not enough for him , so that they did not divide the reed through a cable .
in my first day of arrest I asked me if the investig@@ ator had worked earlier than gar@@ bage , or whether it belonged to normal working configuration .
they had four cables in each other to present themselves from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
three of them will be changed within one hour , while I was still in the series .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice I heard .
the Hen@@ ker noticed the cooling and found no pleasure in all , so he was the next to a electrically charged staff .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ bare body , which lay out on the ground was the perfect power conductor .
the divers van@@ ished and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he met his duty for these night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep on me again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed away , which came before me as few minutes .
then call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light ful@@ fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering the voice of a troubled young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father has to worry about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and keep you , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am h@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cig@@ ar in his studio .
this photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am h@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ covers the most of its time inside ; times he pl@@ otted to his screen , time to his computer , and again to his couch .
but after that you can leave a cig@@ ar between his fingers , or his lips with nic@@ ot@@ ine fle@@ eing lips .
he lives in the top of his family house , which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ een ( about : farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activity , which is transferred to the conservative majority against gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression by art and rap@@ ture .
with his music that places often with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry . all these issues are not only found in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a man who is not restricted by bound@@ aries , and he can feel at his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it isn &apos;t open it openly , he turns against US American foreign policy , a special appeal .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas , something like he was born in Jordan as &quot; Palestinian Po@@ wers &quot; - so he himself , even though he was born in Jordan and never before being in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life , &quot; emphas@@ ises H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that I am a man , while he dissolved in water &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan . in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast@@ en from sunrise until sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
apparently , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sensitive Jun@@ it@@ ag had little with protest against Islam .
basically , the pieces of warm coffee and the wa@@ ist of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when one th@@ rows a look into the neighbouring countries .
therefore it is easy to do to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - to do not in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary elections which support the Islamic Act of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of hom@@ osexual fron@@ ts@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , is contra@@ dic@@ ting and the main reason for the concert tab@@ s .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former pressing of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singers .
many of them also claim that the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more hazardous acti@@ vis@@ m that provides the most proven legitim@@ acy reg@@ imes in the whole region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a was the progressive people as &quot; progressive support of human rights , &quot; which still has decided to use &quot; an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply called Rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually a clear@@ er reality is reflected in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs plant clearly .
in the year 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender nor@@ ms to the body by giving his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ iced sex .
the picture shows the Skel@@ eton of a obviously unknown woman , whose arms and legs ends up to the corners of the screen .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by hands of those who actually should trust in confidence .
in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; honorary moral &apos; - the un@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch , according to Human Rights Watch , reached its zen@@ ith in 2016 ; however , Jordan was still missing that Jordan was missing the institutional infrastructure to support the victims , victims of murder , or domestic violence .
according to a law to un@@ interrup@@ tions from 1954 , women who are exposed to a danger of in@@ defin@@ ite violence , &quot; and for their release is often a year @-@ long bureau@@ cr@@ atic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music is delighted with great popularity and is well @-@ known for this , also in front of topics , which are as tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b claims that his work is polit@@ ically , however , is that he is able to separate his music that is full of explicitly on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , not from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
in me , politics was told , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question after the Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are polit@@ ically polit@@ ically , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
a verse is often repeated in this song :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the further development of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind market , in which one can get , in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ believ@@ ing , hetero@@ gen@@ e@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that barely any man talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on gender equality between L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya in order to notice that his comments were torn out from the context , rev@@ sted and his opinion was cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but stretched it only an amended version , &quot; says he .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arabic L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance compared to homosexu@@ als did not talk to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ i , a poet of the eighth century , who still has remained in remembrance thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ vo , who would like to work once in order to work in order to write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why are Jord@@ an@@ ians not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b did not have anything with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled to do .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom there is nothing new , that the government attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service resum@@ ed several former government members and members of the Lec@@ turer , with the grounds , they had expressed himself in social media critic@@ ises the problems with the deeply ro@@ oted corruption .
according to what is the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , only the top of the Eis@@ ber@@ gs - the actual challenge is to act a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is a permanent type and take a gig . Jordan has got a gig now for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks for slow , bed@@ time and in@@ tra @-@ changes . he is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s , were coming from a Arabian world without inter@@ ventions .
he dre@@ amed not only that his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
perhaps the region with the help of music , art and literature will be a real and basic open@@ ness - and not by bombs , stre@@ um@@ erable and artificial type her@@ ent Democrats . at least , he hopes it .
until it is far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to pass , and thus also resist the resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis reporting , which belongs to the A@@ man as student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ ks are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ ula Festivals .
it is thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which was also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the drums and dancing were over a thousand years , in the armies from the West Japan in the nor@@ theastern China to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi to force the knee .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to gra@@ b a few great seats , therefore we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I &apos;ve been looking back to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ ula Festival is the only truth - and to spend a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ meter car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely been external apparition and body care as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from the crime and maintain a legitim@@ ate profession as to promote the fresh@@ ness course .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road smo@@ b and illegal drugs are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this area do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - as many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ style of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , and N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to give himself more normal citizens to the experienced hands of hair@@ style , which can make this increased hair@@ style .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ style , which go to the extreme borders of imagination and creativity , even has an annual event inspired to contest the hair@@ style &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts contrary to each other , to show those who can see the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks how to see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions there are available on the public fac@@ ebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here a opportunity to find young people to convince their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of poor ratings a training in the hair@@ dresser art , which makes it possible to find work .
motiv@@ ated by this activity and some opportunities , dozens of young people saw that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops ahead of the school year before the school year and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only expert school in the municipality and the district which we are very proud , because of love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ vo .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the amended version of the &quot; Liebes@@ ambassador for gu@@ err@@ illa &quot; in gu@@ err@@ illa &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the post is published here within a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
isn &apos;t it a lot more important , people who feel it out , aff@@ ection for us ?
this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , who inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ón ( Letters to Re@@ conc@@ iliation ) , young people to encourage young gu@@ err@@ illa letters .
recently , her country was the place of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after the long negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered as meaning@@ ful that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its for the Nobel Peace Prize .
however , before the Colom@@ bian , there is a long way until you can talk about a real reconciliation and peace of peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa soldier , who lived in illeg@@ itim@@ ate camps for many years , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and contributed around the clock to integrate their weapons again in life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society again who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases , it has to record into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian convinced that the young colum@@ n@@ ans would have to close together and help the integration process .
and exactly what did they do : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa regime in order to welcome them again in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa , which will then be handed over .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the Campa@@ ign
the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Prize winners who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk just with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people whom we love to write on the Day of thousands of love letters , but those forgotten that they need much need .
he was telling that he continued to share his love with people in this year , bre@@ eded the most ur@@ gent matters .
so the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now will find their place in the company and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make a dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19th March in one of the UN camps .
a group of 40 students from J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ art Foundation in the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC set up on how they had done earlier in order to meet the orders of their leader .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all participants . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between lies &quot; telling the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Govern@@ ors of the Valle del Cau@@ ca Province , described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after having passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; ( a kind of tent , in which the gu@@ err@@ illa boys live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa soldier , who wrote something .
I was afraid to enter , because beside him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ egran@@ ate , a dead@@ ly weapon in the Dor@@ n@@ th@@ igh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what are they just ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never , in my life , someone has written something so beautiful , therefore I am going on . &quot; since I suddenly ran tears over the che@@ eks .
I troubled him , and set me beside the pom@@ egran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I &apos;m sorry for all the years of the faithful companion of this cat , and would help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had to join the F@@ ARC , the only possibility to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive myself for my mist@@ akes .
but now I know that there is a company outside , who wa@@ its with open arms for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have only learned how to handle weapons with weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but now where peace is prev@@ ailing , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new votes
at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together at a discussion round .
the students were all grew up as a war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
that is why the leader of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced , how to develop the social in@@ justice by the state of the state to develop a political party , we can help to create a political party in this country .
for a target of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people have never heard , who had never heard their hearing , and did not know that people who have often seen as a monster , and even hated even people with great feelings that were turned through their lives and its environment , was very painful for me .
the truth , in which the country lives , does me hurt me .
but it comfort me that all men - also those who have killed and have caused much damage to bring with us and give us a smile and a h@@ ug .
many former fighters have answered the letters to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote to the example of Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ vo , the arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the column was prophesied that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation would be peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will be always people who are ready to sei@@ ze , and to protest their rights , and this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
therefore we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology belong to them - are talking about all those who are dre@@ aming of a country in the war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from your own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend the lives as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way there will be many obstacles on our way , but we will overcome them together .

this follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner A@@ ida Mir@@ mac@@ sum@@ owa and its first published in the OC Media website .
hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a large bandwidth of d@@ angers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and path@@ ogen .
with terror , activists have experienced the coverage of the last months over the persecution s@@ ul@@ er men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ onal value on the local L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community , was not only done over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ y who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about it what happens in the Republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines after several months , after reports were published that dra@@ g@@ ation , torture and killing que@@ er males in the Republic of thematic areas .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ k@@ ina in Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta , and she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , who took part in secret pris@@ ons and killed them in secret pris@@ ons .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
as early as early childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they became adult , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ an@@ enen was opened by the gen@@ e@@ alog@@ y of her estate , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
she went from fear of her life in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunte@@ er hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ verse that appears in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone did , from whom I thought , he would be a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere in the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he s@@ ick@@ ed them on his t@@ ash@@ ic friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men going to remove this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made by all W@@ hat@@ s@@ app the round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing a few shopping street from the back of my car , I heard a male who say : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt something in my body , but did not hurt me .
then I heard a set , but this time on t@@ ush@@ i : &quot; how long will you honour the family yet ? &quot;
I knew not the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ wo@@ ke last end of the hospital again .
apparently , some women had to get everything and started sh@@ out .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had taken two samples in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary wings .
OC Media : in which n@@ urs@@ ors they were laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name ; but the doctor stopped and laid me in the women .
I am very grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as good man .
I am than@@ k@@ ful to him that he is respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , stranger , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a Alp@@ ha@@ ms .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie .
they set ab@@ sur@@ d recei@@ v@@ ables : some said me , I have to prove it , that I had not changed in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ y , saying that I did not change my sex that everything was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say in TV ?
OC Media : how did your family tries to deal with this print ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some elderly people spoke to my mother at the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , but not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she placed a kn@@ it around the neck .
fortunately , the neigh@@ bors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
after it happened for the third time , I was clear that something was la@@ zy .
my Human Rights @-@ Friends re@@ prove the number@@ ing of the number@@ ing - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give their names , but I will say that I remember it all , they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something anno@@ ying happened .
I still cannot understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it , without permission , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the rub@@ b@@ ish .
came and checked the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe in safety , only because you have left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel you push . you even know your room number .
only to prove it : it is Number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
that was really my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the sexual activity , that &apos;s a table topic .
some traditionally cas@@ c@@ cas@@ ian elements , I still carry out in me .
so very much I wish I can &apos;t overcome this se@@ al@@ gic barrier .
I say always that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
when we make with camera , I really give me about how the person is out of their past , thus it is remin@@ is@@ cent of my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with someone who has spent one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan it had not been arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan was hardly able to wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
so that I , they invite you to load the relatives with the affected person , and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ ung .
OC Media : are they now weak@@ ened in these secret conditions now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me says it wasn &apos;t very many .
if , especially those who have no rich relatives , or who have dropped from their relatives to present the Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they will be held there to present them later than terror@@ ists .
say : should they be brought down , they will show her body in television , and claim that they had attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these men had not simply disappeared , but specifically to di@@ pped themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is this only a mut@@ ation or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just got someone who had been imprisoned for a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after her be@@ ard had grown .
there was nothing new of them .
they simply took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was taken away when these people were taken away .
however , they were not yet introduced as band@@ its , but there were no reports so far . we assume that such actions are possible .
why else would you not allowed to shave this man ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation which took place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always bore my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in the very Gro@@ z@@ ny when I still lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the aria was applied , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much saf@@ er than now .
Russia wanted to lead us to &quot; civil king &quot; at the time , but he finally threw us back to the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted , I had colored eyelashes , bore tubes and short tops .
the Department of Department of Sh@@ aria has never been glu@@ ed to me only a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met with me .
it was a small place where several banks arose , and the whole city knew about it , why men , young people met there .
we were never off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a spe@@ ech@@ ing : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t go beyond the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it often to children , if they make the sick of sick .
OC Media : so they simply shut up their eyes before you , because they believed you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never ins@@ ul@@ ted me , never ch@@ ased and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long did this ministry start ?
Sab@@ rina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ al in TV .
he spoke not to us by se , but foremost on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city began to change .
he who suffered before and raised up , looked at once with suspic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel as the situation in the Republic steadily disappeared .
OC Media : what activity do you go after ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA are not much .
apart from that , I still worked as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ates with them as a type psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , conven@@ tions , I beg@@ ged them to the hospital and help them to get food types .
I don &apos;t forget any cent .
I discovered these people , when I did exc@@ use the flu@@ ency .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : apply a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ ms .
so is the nature that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to make you with foam before the mouth that there is no oscill@@ ation with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which the Cab@@ ard@@ iner have , who also have Russians ; on all the planet , there are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is very pleasant , so what to hear .
I meet so many guys from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque and fast@@ ing during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
do you know , many think of tran@@ sid@@ y of men , the men love , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a Tru@@ g@@ utter .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact , different hab@@ itats .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not very sad - I know that I &apos;m now myself .
local groups Ab@@ le before an increase of self @-@ moral within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high occupational health and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the past months , there is a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ atorium .
the photo of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 came back the two situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under attack@@ ers , depression , and he sto@@ op@@ ed for his own help , to get in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Human Rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous .
one on YouTube shared video kept the moments after he had attached itself .
some people made it quickly to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could not do any more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only one committed suicide in August within the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activ@@ ist activists before that even more men could take the lives .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights told that this month some other - Ham@@ id manifest , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , Say@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hanged .
their stories have a matter together : they were all family @-@ perpet@@ rators , who , due to the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable , to nour@@ ish their families and a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment , and discrimination
the region , which is a majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was struck by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population .
before a century , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a mainly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took power and under@@ taking great efforts to termin@@ ate ethnic autonomy throughout the whole Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran present oil and gas fields as well as some of the most common and valuable useful space for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slowly , and the native population receives only little from this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and kidn@@ apping .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s systematically , in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a large number of dem@@ ons , the water of the Arab regions in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are round .
these dem@@ me only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by d@@ rought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ youth rose to 81 % now .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for Ko@@ cher , work and social welfare , told that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a work that completed elementary school , 55 % of secondary school completed and 45 % have a university degree .
a systematic strategy ... it aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activists in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of self @-@ mor@@ atorium among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men .
Ken@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has got worse . due to this , a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z newly founded ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since functional and institutions preferred not to work in Arabic working forces , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will de@@ pri@@ ved the access to work possibilities in all sectors .
this is a part of systematic politics of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s , and to force them to earn their hab@@ itable outside of their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their advantages and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as the Arab names are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of Arab language or Tra@@ cking Arab clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i must bear the human rights activists , before the situation explo@@ ited .
it remains to wait for whether the world aw@@ akes and knowledge .

&quot; why didn &apos;t I identi@@ fi@@ able with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ ession

the following article is a revised version of comments written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments using the original text .
if I say that I am not a femin@@ ine , many women - especially white women who design@@ ate themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even think well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments from me , why I should be femin@@ ine and why we should be all femin@@ ists * inside .
for example , that women still earn less money in spite of similar formation as men .
that women still stand under str@@ ingent observation , unless they are going to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards ensure that women had to stum@@ ble or later in various areas of life to a gl@@ ass@@ uring blan@@ ket , and that discrimination based on sex still attracts across the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced of it and I am dou@@ bling twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to skin colour , on pen@@ it@@ ism , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention , what kind of being physically , se@@ duc@@ al and verb@@ al have been mis@@ used , both in and outside the fem@@ inist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - together should come together to sing &quot; their voices , and &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to get the equality ( some ) of the women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that there are in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an associate form of self @-@ motiv@@ ated violence which we are exposed to black women on two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration background more often the school will be interpreted as white girl , due to obvious integration issues .
or that women in black sp@@ ears and women with migration background a higher risk are suspended , domestic violence and violence to suffer from the partnership as white women .
on the other hand I want to join all men , all men , and all men of any skin . on the other hand , I cannot join me as a black woman , whose centre is the white woman , who refused to take into consideration of their thinking in their thinking , which relate to both gender and skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white femin@@ istic @-@ oriented sp@@ ies that has always turned me and countless other black women always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 1851 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In their speech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to just@@ ify a ide@@ ology in which the black woman in a historical respect is a horri@@ ble and mar@@ gin@@ alized beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me group , which also absorb our customs and customs to drive their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program .
I &apos;m not trying to push white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to overcome the importance of black women for fem@@ inist movement dead , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give a home to women to be a home and eng@@ age by white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I am going to resol@@ ve me full and entirely of femin@@ ism and join me the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , to use my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of me for a white @-@ fem@@ inist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in our own ideas and will give us to the don@@ tics that will be created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana Falls : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism ) says that we can defend ourselves to our own species . and not only that - black women can also realize in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , se@@ el@@ ian , physical and even the spiritual elements can be ad@@ mi@@ red that make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I pray you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ di@@ ctions of fem@@ inist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures because of the par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I &apos;m recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradise .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment , neither igno@@ res my life nor igno@@ red , nor denied .

Paraguay Women and their difficult fighting against violence
one group women represents &quot; The weeping Women &quot; to bring their pain on the women &apos;s moral in the country and to show its re@@ jection .

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ dish . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ un@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) , who reported on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protection of affected persons .
a police commission@@ er A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that she was nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ partner who had become a violent company .
since the end of its relationship has gone some time and the police said , their statement would be laid down to the action , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena did not consider for abuse , also the acute indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was nothing .
a few days later , the second woman returned to her ad .
the Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ is of violence against women is difficult .
if women once ad once ad , they do not receive support by the State .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on the men that they mis@@ use . this explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit violence to be victims of violence at all in the prosecution authorities .
ingredients and Statist@@ ical 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that nothing under immune laws : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics
it &apos;s hard to determine how many women really mis@@ use , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for com@@ at@@ eries at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports , which show not even to the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them .
however , the numbers are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General At@@ tor@@ ney came to 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women .
86 % of ads when the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence . also here 86 % of ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women who were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women said of psych@@ ic abuse .
this statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ical Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i will actually appear only a few of this off@@ ences . &quot; on each woman who is re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay for mental abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
on each woman who re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed for physical abuse are re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , two women who do not do this , &quot; explained at the end of 2014 .
as women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay cannot be in@@ adequate , the prosec@@ utions authorities cannot be in@@ adequate , as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners .
by August 2016 journalists there were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordin@@ ators for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases , in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies due to violence through men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the fixed gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that they called his name of all her former friends .
at the beginning it was not really wanted to do that , but after that , however , it was for ever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but for two years she bore the psych@@ ic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ z@@ able :
I never thought that I would have become a victim of abuse once .
if I have read it earlier , I always thought that the only women happens to under@@ go the ones , because they let go out of violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about failure by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his ins@@ ul@@ sions and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people answered on their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ isch if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to be a form of mist@@ ress .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long of Carlos , and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost like that they wanted to say that victims of Mis@@ sions could have at least a certain co @-@ debt .
Victoria Santos , who is not of Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner did not work .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all involved in some sort of abuse .
in the group , they can speak with others about their experience , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
their prosper@@ ous partner even managed to convince them to convince them .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as displays with the authorities without result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against its former partners , who developed into an un@@ search@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , where it was mainly for money , power and the influence of its former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied .
the display of missions is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for women in Paraguay , looks also great problems in the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the H@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # Inter@@ pack ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Easy ) are part of a campaign based on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law looks to explain the Fem@@ ale in an autonomous criminal off@@ ences and har@@ der as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia of the case .
thus , the legislative text was altered in some points to win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which are generally banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had provided the majority of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence at present themselves , if they simply receive instant indication and secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature has no sufficient financial resources available to :
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ ate is seen as a part of human relationships .
here , a change must take place , that violence is no longer regarded as a little standardi@@ zation .
he who dis@@ appoint@@ ments in view of these facts is guilty and also contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we have to be so long display , until mist@@ ress does not apply more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law have been modified . in this case , a passage was cancelled , which called partners in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section concerning Re@@ conc@@ iliation was seen as the opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Act , however , is considered a big return . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after the prohibition of a newspaper still exposed to attacks
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Information Minister , &quot; at the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n in the Sult@@ ant because of their coverage of corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he is a prison sentence .

the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the execution of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the freedom of press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .

in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure , to raise a judgment in an inheritance .

the newspaper was closed on un@@ certain days after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the court took place in Mas@@ k@@ at the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Court sentenced three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .

in spite of the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again allow the newspaper to be exposed to attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and thus the Minister for the decision of the Appeals Court presented the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases , in which Oman at the youngest time the press was hurt .
for example , for example , the closure of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation .
due to the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ bian authorities are still not ready to prepare an extensive violation of the Press Freedom .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is only rarely or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most ur@@ gent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need in front of the site . there are two reasons : for a lack of global healthcare system many medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and Malaria have far more serious effects than elsewhere in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by pharmac@@ ies are a big problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , with its own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er is director of the centre for the research of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Sam@@ bia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched on HIV virus before being decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ische healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and on mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ ors speaks private people ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic National Programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions to what we have been developed .
this must change , otherwise we will always be recipi@@ ent to stay instead of myself .
the solutions that we get are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
g@@ v : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find appropriate scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
projects are supported differently well .
it &apos;s difficult to find people who come back or come here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs plenty of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there is demand for special academic education , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research on the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit of it very well .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientist in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the full access to scientific expertise that show here challenges .
the system that magazines are available only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seeds produce worldwide food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine created by solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has been bred for Sal@@ ad in the United States since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant , which has grown from NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ ons &apos;s work was only bound by his own in@@ corruption and the question as many sal@@ at@@ varieties can get set limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s it noted that more sal@@ ads were patented , so that it could not continue to bre@@ athe out .
the patents are not only suitable for individual types , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special Rot@@ or or green leaves .
over the last few years , more such patents have been registered to more plants such as cer@@ eals or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environmental protection and experts for food security ensure the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , M@@ orton is still a salad , but he still needs more restrictions as well as his work is still further worth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a river a b@@ oul@@ der which I must have sh@@ aker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we must make this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think this patents have to go to sal@@ ads .
and if they stand before the judgment , no one can bre@@ athe out any new salad because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes so good as possible and tries to recover the characteristics that he would like .
however , it is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use no material that is protected as a spiritual property .
he also joined a movement that is increasingly larger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have red Roman sal@@ ads in the &quot; green@@ house &quot; of the station far@@ med and eaten . it is tested to be cultivated if plants can be grown in space .

it &apos;s no co@@ incidence that this name would be so sounds like the movement from the IT area , and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as a spiritual property and can be used for plant bre@@ eders .
in the context of the initiative , shortly Oss@@ i , US bre@@ eders could under@@ take to use himself that other seeds may have been cultivated in them .
however , this does not mean that they can do with their seed well , and they can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow others to cross your seed , to cross your own varieties , and it is not immediately exp@@ elled - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plants .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
sc@@ aff@@ old prospects
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Oss@@ i @-@ Executive Committee , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seed well and the opportunity to bre@@ ads new plants as well as for environmental protection .
seeds plays to him a role in larger mer@@ ging such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter no or only little while breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with genet@@ ically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genet@@ ically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; for example , what is good , locally and su@@ stain@@ ably certified organic farming , such as it is offered on pe@@ asant markets , should also know that the species is bred to itself as this vegetables is bred .
nutrition so@@ vereign without seed so@@ vereign so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to provide other seed well as freely available . in contrast , their approach is to patented , seed well and vegetable features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i supporters argu@@ ed that the future of the food supply is end@@ anger@@ ed , as the available gene pool because of the always numerous new spiritual property rights on plant material , which thus always is limited , un@@ readable .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . it took out that about one @-@ third of all cart@@ oning features are protected as a spiritual ownership , making it not only worth in plant bre@@ eders .
for other plants there are no estimates not yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by means that mass@@ ac@@ red plants as wheat are still sized pat@@ inated , as a salad or car@@ rot .
a question of visibility
plants will be bred so far@@ med that they provide specific features - by such that their taste or their colour has improved until such , due to them flour@@ ish and thre@@ ats like p@@ ests or diseases such as p@@ ests and diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders by more and more patents are currently increasing . genetic variety is currently necessary than ever before , because the changing conditions in climate change are much worse than ever .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to is that genetic diversity was generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States , the company established itself for the conservation of genetic diversity .
it is however , however , the view that intellectual property will promote other bre@@ eders , da &quot; patents and the protection of plant varied innovations . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expi@@ res .
often , these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
such protection was not in@@ hib@@ ited innovations , but promotes them to be provided by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
M@@ orton looks for the other way : 20 years to wait until a patent expi@@ res , certainly there is no innovations .
and if you have to wait for so long , on plants can be adapted to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have lost the fight .
the main argument for M@@ orton is that genetic resources always have been a general good and still should remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ aries are not attractive to us .
we want to facilitate farmers their work .
that &apos;s it , which drives us , and it &apos;s impossible to use it , if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in all , M@@ orton is concerned with the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we do not create the features really itself .
the plants make them away , and as bre@@ eders we had no idea how the plants do it .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Oss@@ i Executive Board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who ch@@ ased a variety , stri@@ ves its own values in it .
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with big farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation , her@@ b@@ icides are needed , who are breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is precisely genet@@ ically modified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets but smaller than such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , it will create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either re@@ ject the patented or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank M@@ orton is looking for Sal@@ ads in its breeding garden .
photo by Karen M@@ orton .
M@@ orton is also the view that trains by the Av@@ oid of vegetable patented innovative would : &quot; it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented .
I need a constantly new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years itself , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent is protected for 20 years before competition , where you simply make my opinion very nice . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the United States seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept spreads very quickly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program works through farmers together with farmers , helping them to bre@@ ads new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports you to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ e works on an &quot; Open Source &quot; license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Oss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , in due to the Oss@@ i obligation can not simply be acquired one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it concerns the current practice of the European Patent Office , the patents applied to conventional plants .
however , a statement is not yet no law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent to this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from across East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ entation of seed products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that the organization is currently a worldwide alliance of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds for the planned next year of the official starting signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit @-@ development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed well @-@ map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of Essen@@ tial , was published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have to come to produce , to exchange and to improve seed policies , so that a stable supply of food supplies can be ensured .
this report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a varied , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , by Lu@@ by Oss@@ i , hopes that soon more people will be recogni@@ z@@ able soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has shown above all that and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a roll , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now try to clear the people , that even beyond their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and Blog are the newest targets of the C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
this sometimes it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend around the 05.@@ August the Egyptian government stopped the website of the network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which has documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network released a statement on Facebook which critic@@ ized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
in spite of this attack , the Network for Human Rights Information remain - despite this attack and the Constitution in the Arab world , in this part of the world , it was never so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI confirms that all technical possibilities would be exhau@@ sted to overcome and not follow . we hope to meet our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities have blocked 21 pages of websites , like b@@ assist the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave trap to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt in the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the spread of column and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , whom he set up in order to circum@@ vent the z@@ ens@@ ur@@ ion of the Egyptian government , even the goal of a attack .
Blo@@ gger , who is native to Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he participated in the student protests and executed a video like the police of physical violence against two students .
his article is mainly turning around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed the re@@ jection of the government and refle@@ cting what does it mean for him :
the blo@@ gs , blo@@ g@@ ging is very old but has nevertheless been priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the blocking of the blo@@ gs may not be meaning@@ ful for the world , it is it for two reasons for me :
1 ) It is possible to give me the feeling of a siege of siege to me ; an arrest , a su@@ al murder , pre@@ load on the national Security Council , the blocking of Blogs and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) They have proven that I wrote not for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first I used it to post the item of articles to get the zen@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mud leave the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities opened from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the network of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the pl@@ umb@@ ing of providers which was possible by changing Internet @-@ sur and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12th , we felt like the blocking of websites that started V@@ P@@ N@@ s .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block contents and filters to block the Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed that the interest rates are met behind closed doors , thereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with the help of this acts against this acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are dispute .

day for day and throughout Brazil , newspapers reports from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home numerous postcards .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ th@@ iev@@ es Phar@@ m@@ acy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ se sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air af@@ ee after Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a stressed financial situation , the Communist wave of 2017 in Rio reached the highest status for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice called even the United Nations .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on August 16 the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision declared the newspaper as follows :
extra will continue to report about crimes reported in any major city on the world , such as murder , smo@@ b , sexual abuse , etc . everything that happens in Rio , will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we didn &apos;t close our eyes in front of the grave .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes declared that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war@@ fare in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist reported that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 territories , which are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article , the newspaper writes :
it is aware that a war dis@@ course when it is dist@@ orted , even though he can be used , atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to betra@@ y .
but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partner .
is the name &quot; War &quot; more than it profit ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journalist in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira to describe the violence as &quot; War &quot; by the media and might make it difficult to move the responsibility of the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as an extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in personnel , ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ neg@@ le@@ cted public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just his capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is false : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most current available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we watch the mor@@ se each state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes .

in addition to these safety measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ ce gol@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the State of Rio in 2003 , belonged to the police unit , whose goal is to conquer a Fav@@ ela and permanently stationary there .
at the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP had to protect against the poor municipalities which should protect the curious police unit to protect the curious police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux wrote from one of his article in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention on the criteria of the &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of Rio as war is also serious consequences for people after itself .

since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X and the Research Institute for PA@@ X and the Research Institute , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently has a million Syrians in a state of siege .
particularly strong is the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons demanded the life of hundreds of civilians in August 21 , 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acres committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these reb@@ els have been con@@ founded by reb@@ els outside the siege of Damascus , which led to the residents of local or through tun@@ nels and control points .
the years of long block@@ ade are traditional food products such as meat become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics are the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; li@@ fel@@ ine food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the conventional , in Syria planted food products and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes them a attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Board of Directors , subscription Nab@@ il , said opposite the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we chose us for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years since three years , this project has been well @-@ known and pressed his relief , that it now wins more and more &quot; an acquain@@ t@@ ness . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ lies the humanitarian C@@ row@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to produce 125 families of knowledge of plant@@ ing mushrooms , Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of its expected target of around 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is based on generators which maintain the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel cell , locally produced fuel from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy supply .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with &quot; production from the regions of the fung@@ us , before they have checked their quality and are whether they are suitable for consumption .
afterwards they planted a small Pil@@ z@@ hof in a tub . when they succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teaching farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have mushrooms in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring people out the fung@@ us of various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break@@ age of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ supply , making food waste ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) to profit new food .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea in all over the world , so our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want that our experiences people in crisis areas inspired and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese Demand for Justice for the Vic@@ tims of fires in 2017
several hundred people were protest@@ ing in many districts in Portugal and called justice for the victims of fires that gr@@ ates in the north of Portugal in the week of Portugal .
two @-@ two people died , and about 70 were injured following the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to that the government had proclaimed last week from solidarity with victims for 3 days .
fires were registered in the region of G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en in Spain , where it was 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ bur@@ ns that spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite recordings are burned in 2017 in Portugal about 500,000 acres of forest - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
thus you can make you a better picture of the Ernst of the location : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the fore@@ se@@ eable tragedy
the objective of Saturday was the demand for better relief and fire control measures through the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to in@@ corporate the extent of tragedy so far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al of the Federation of farmers declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did so no@@ where : there are dozens of open reports of open streets , surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have had to happen in June , as the roads were blocked very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits in est@@ ranged with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a far @-@ sufficient proposal for the Wal@@ de@@ form , which had brought the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was raised by the commun@@ es which saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , if the applicant has funds for self @-@ protection - this was an open back@@ door , so that it was built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; João Sor@@ val continues to continue in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus made it out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us , trees made from light burning wood , as in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ re@@ is , after fires of this species still spread .
in addition to these problems we added that the site of civil protection from Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , when the residents sought , or tried to contact those who was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : you use their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and inform@@ al the population in real time about the site and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers of João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of fire brig@@ ade and was decis@@ i@@ vely by this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400,000 users , who followed the fires . this website counted more than half a million .

during one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan started by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group , who had defeated the short @-@ lasting per @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air .
this time was named A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i province in Central Afghan Pakistan for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother doesn &apos;t say it then , she knew that she couldn &apos;t see her son very long - maybe even more .
in the morning the boy was breaking .
his un@@ cle would pick it off and bring him to the locks .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was murdered just by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly .
the Taliban were always closer to its hat@@ red for Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found themselves in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a coh@@ es@@ ru@@ be . the work was hard and made him ill .
then he took the thing that was left of his low pay , and went in Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towing bags with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than he himself to earn his living .
at that time , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , which we worked on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we put nylon before the open window , so that we do not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af released his life without pap@@ ers in Iran , and made it ready for the trip to Europe .
on the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities turned his asylum seek@@ ers , A@@ shar@@ ks came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , went alone by the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day in Essen .
it is true that Italy is a major second chance for asylum seek@@ ers . it &apos;s true , however , that the terms that the terms of asylum seek@@ ers in the country is cat@@ astroph@@ ic .
the Human Rights of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering under a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers will only be assigned to a recording center when they have officially applied for asylum - what can be post@@ pon@@ ed after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers .
till then there are people who have no money for an accommodation either to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so that A@@ shar@@ af did so .
but his un@@ defiled life , A@@ shar@@ af , helped him to free from these conditions .
after he made various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af turned his entire story in the founding of a host@@ els in Venice .
it ran so well that after a while another hostel opened a second hostel and a bar@@ ren .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now the theme of the handic@@ apped Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( german : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wah@@ id@@ i .
the Venice City Award in 2017 has been awarded the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
much bureau@@ cracy , high tax and conditions for loans are only some of obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
over the last years some of Afghanistan operating companies were created , including dres@@ s@@ ands , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even blessed in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience in Venice , where the cell@@ ars and the kitchen staff are mainly refugees from various parts of the world .
the menu of restaurant tells about the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the story of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the p@@ izzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome also standing Afghanistan .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to pass far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic industries and Ret@@ ail and aim to go back to the country which he had to forced to leave teenagers as teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can not live happy if I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af includes plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , which can learn the people of packaging and preserv@@ atives . &quot; so they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve its financial situation , &quot; says he .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eurs was a journey through un@@ certainty and doub@@ ts , but at the end stand stability and prosper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af did this journey itself . now he would like to help others Afghanistan on this way .
