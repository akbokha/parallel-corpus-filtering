<seg id="1">Although I visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have picked up American music, American writers and operated in sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a serious impact on me that I became mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the grand Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Studying, the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who wanted to inclined their interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else I would like to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you're always that you can, and it is easy to find in a community of equalled human beings.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very nice love cover about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racial of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as it goes with its commitment.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says what he thinks, as a former colleague it express, and declared his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people reacts on his statements and tuned in notes for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes that he won by the republican elections, was the highest number ever made by the Party nominated candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters with men, whom I had learned during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Such as my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, takes people from all over the world, a deep glomless man, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps Unification did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for Basketball and we spent many hours with the "Phoenix Suns" on the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intoleranz is also in contrast to generosity, which I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fights for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, which treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me and help me and my colleagues to get to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">And there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice has helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those caused by them combined my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While the way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the equivalent of its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe even because of his contempt to non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The struggles with the idea that people voted for trump, because they had either distributed his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to oversee these things, nearly the heart broke.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is not fair to describe Trump-voters as a raassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act on another way and thinking.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes will not be taken into account in their congregations.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most of them are, voted for Trump, because they would like to rewin control of a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they may perhaps say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks at those who look at those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "" "" "" "" Whitelash "" "" (note).: as much as "" "" Rejection of the White Against all Other Ethics, "" "" The Word of white in Anplay on the White and Wrash, which means so much does the great Van Jones called exactly what America has done so great. "" "</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always like, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as his President, twice the son of a Kenite, whose history as he himself says that it would be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of white America's promise and says: to Hell with frequent, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America, after 9 / 11, the white man is back on the ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">In a manifestation for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the human being.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have had my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud voice "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"have Muslims in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brushed the lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would someone who doesn't like to do a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a one-voting and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "God be thankfully, Mr. Trump, isn't it your America." 36 hours later he was conferred.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son was, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find in this new America no more.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean town of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That music that is played on both places is not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill area, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby precolonial Ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years now the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has been playing in the municipality: one of children and adults existing symphony orchestra, which has found their musical instruments to overcome the overcoming poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for their drugs abuse and the banana violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth had always offered a rare hopelessly.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group, the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to follow their big passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You will always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you can learn day for Day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timke, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the largest landfill of AsunciÃ³n in the capital of Paraguay - on instruments which are made of recovered waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with restored instruments made from local fixed waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycling of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to transform parts of the loss in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, violas, Celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trumpets and percussion that were made out of the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio ChÃ¡vez remembers a local economist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach the parents in the rubbish. the children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: one out of the waste produced.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of recovered material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary Names "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic landfill) shows the musical performance to:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tonnes of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who are with him and live with him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into a little beauty.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from trl-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work successfully against illegal fishing companies</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports targeted solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Republished in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing waters before it was seeking the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries were correspondingly offered and a little bit inclined to confinalize the criminals of this species on its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compores, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refused him to reach one of its harbours and refused to share a fishing territory.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that all of you could simply refused." "" "he remembers the Kiilu, an executive employee of the Kenan fishing authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship of a stone." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay $2 million in Liberia for pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and protect resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegally, Fishing (Illegal Fisheries stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries who had expelled the Premier of their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are equiscated and work together. they exchange information and stand on each other where it is illegal fishing." "", "Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charming Trusts project Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is being caught, so it is extremely difficult to grow. thus, illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate abempt of existing laws, which should be protected by means of certain living rooms and types, the illegal fishing ecosystem may harm a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during the actions of illegal fishing, once again, the actions were curated by bureaucratic hurdles, with the information between individual countries, the actions are today in real-time, with traceability on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There you can exchange the individual countries together for example lists existing licenses, news to digest activities or more details that one had noticed during an port inspections.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursued the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables to mark the authorities to mark ships that are fishing in banned areas - such as such that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fish license where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing catch can be found on the basis of this information that the ships can't be sold in their harbors. what means that the ships can't be used to sell their charge, as in the case of the Premier League.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "about considerable financial losses for the owner, what means that the illegal fishing catch is financially no longer worth." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to reach, "says Per Erik Bergh, conductive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a caterer company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover, which lose eight members of the network HISH-i each year due to Illegal Fischer who penetrate the East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region's commercial fishing catch from around the world. under these same illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, specifying phantasia, fish protected species and fish in nature conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a nonsense organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "a ship was illegal and a country could say" "" "you don't want to walk my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legitimate hole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">To date, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks, which had counterfake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has been persecuted and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Based on cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing companies across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">Some of our research lead us quite far into the networks of organizing crime, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that can help FISH-i to multiply vessels of precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that has always been developed further, helps to hide the illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst with Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships have to switch their automatic identification systems, where they can't be able to be able anymore by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal offences with larger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of african have actually influence the influence of illegal fishing problems?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be rendered to each of each tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it, who does what does - this makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for the investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on global level." "" "Pew CharitÃ© Trusts to run a similar project with which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities did not only feel crime, but they also cries out.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously confiscated without license and had hardly any consequences for consequences, they now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries involved in FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in fisheries, since then more licenses are buying more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose deployment is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries notice these successes. "the effect is so strong that us now also copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we are a study object." in West Africa disappear annually several hundred million dollars through illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are six countries joined in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. even they combat the illegal fishing industry, according to the same model as FISH. "by safety, the aim is to create more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia could report on his first major triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were not allowed to have been forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still located in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the take of dimensional rules toward Greko 1, they were a strong sign that they go against illegal catch-catch," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time, evidence is that such a special, collaborative work works to protect the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="163">Within the context of the social, political and economic crisis, the inflation rate is estimated at 500% (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-sufficient lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to conquer his institutional structures and close a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to visit the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the meantime, Quijano said now in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, were examined for crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>

<seg id="203">Starting with the brush, the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he has enough suffered.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family Secrets for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you will not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I couldn't recognize that my father was a thief, Folder and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeofficials. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, his father was Deputy Commander of the secret service division 141 in the prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="224">He said to me, I would become secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father loved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the detainees.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: University reports, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he left me at the entrance of the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a baritone, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little in a blanket wrapped packets and commanded me to wear it by car. when I opened it, I saw that a large clumsy silver was found in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the Baracke, where the stolen objects were taken and undertook me with a wax.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I paralysed in and looked a Liege on the human being tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field-bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fortified the end of a cable; the other end was fastened by the body of the person who was just there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They caught a man with handcuffs on the bed, overshot him with water and pursued him a charge of 220 volts to the genitalia.</seg>

<seg id="248">'I knew that these people were killed'</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the detainees were folded up and were treated with hands.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke to "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, an civilians who was also indicted in the process) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses that naked people with the face down, they were fasted at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Near the entrance, people still quiet on the mattresses.</seg>

<seg id="254">"" "why did you meet me?" "" "Why have you brought me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that, because my father told her home at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence, in the last month witnesses of a very particular displeased translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word (enrolmentsha), which means "older drivers" means, too - maybe even with bÃ¶n rear thanks & # 8212; as "terrible car drivers" translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was available on electronic ads in the entrance and building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was the translator Julian Holmes, a population of Kyotos, which he was also attentive to the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The conservative daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult for elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable. "</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was first removed. the designation "-drivers" (german: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by appropriate, if also the grammatical is not the correct name "Elder drivers" (german: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture did not affect the translation error. we also declared that the error was already contained in the text that they had been tested by the translator and that the translation was not checked in their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "sorry," "" "we sorry that older people through the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online News Service J-Cast News continued to look back in detail with the phenomenon of the "awesome" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "fearful" was refill as an appropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved, but quite a reason to concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005, 1.941 were caused by a total of 19.460 accidents by Seniors. this equates to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, Senegalese seniors 1,803 caused by a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of senior citizen caused accidents in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The naming is not mentioned reporter in which published version of the article comments on the light, which show what preurges are some Japanese seemingly against older drivers:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation were manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the text and active language skills in order to transmit it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active behaviors of target language - something that is in parent's language. generally, the persuasion that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother tongue should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French native-language was to translate from English to French - not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ not employ people with English as a native language that could cause translations into English. this may be on missing understanding for the translating, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English speakers, the Japanese language.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees have left their own data. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best appreciated for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and rying phrases that are created by mechanical translations, show that this technique has not yet been able to replace any human translators. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English forbings in Japan, among them also the raspirish imprints which often uses T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry nor unacceptable or at least harmless. but of great company or by the government who have the funds to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a serious source of their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a big family with little money overlay their least year old son or her minor daughter to another, abundant family. in exchange the child receives food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, that is not mentioned, however, that the children must afford countless days of work, who can never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all that can't be raised within the context of a treaty which cannot be raised.</seg>
<seg id="425">This as Criadazgo is widespread practice in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating from her studies Alvarenga worked a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - gathering witness, calculating and pitively.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name the things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is impaired in Criaditas.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in her house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants, 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>

<seg id="462">She rose up at five o'clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, for example, purified the fridge, cleaning the living room, polished the furniture and the infected.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="475">Also in the school, Alvarenga discriminated. "a thing that is almost never spoken, mobbing and the chicans, which Criaditas are exposed to school.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture of Pixabay, changes from Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently ordered a bill to "regulations regarding the use and commercial social networking."</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is adopted by Parliament, users of social media must register and use social media in Egypt in order to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law a place would be established, which is to be commissioned to share social media citizens and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law would have to be able to register the user with their real name and identity numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it be missed to do this, this may be a penalty of up to six months of prison or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consists of six paragraphs, and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defined social media as "jedwede application that is running on the internet and used to communicate with others through a voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear, as the draft is assumed, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities is currently able to register the useful and users of registering users, which is not able to sign up with the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Saar, parliamentary elections and conveyer of the Legislative Decree, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and a password to get through the firewall which blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to judge a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to them, it would be necessary to submit to the Egyptians and Egyptians, to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are skeptical regarding the technical feasibility of the precursday.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for personal rights, ") told by Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubts strong to the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they are forcible physical public and private rooms that could be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it, then it means that they may apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizens, or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and to bring it to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">That is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature of parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful, or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military thinking in parliament, whose senses is maximized and ensured that no different scration is present on the image surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a Legislative Decree against Cyber crime, who was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who were found guilty of threatening "public order to threaten" and "to protest to protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">High above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq, the animal protection Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq have to protect the spiritual Leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the bigger family of the Leopards, which led by Africa and Asia, are among the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to be found due to Wilderei, the loss and the fraction of their living space, as they always find less prey to endangered.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video shows, "the Persian is the only remaining robbery in Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on that a large room is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in fact is low and goes around zero. when the team therefore asserts that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera body, Raza breaks out in a pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">When educated Biologin shows Raza, a different side of their country, which is not only the war and conflict exists.</seg>
<seg id="531">It has been involved in field studies with wild living animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013, ensuring that protective zones for wildlife will be set up in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="544">Early March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shanno, the progress made in the past six years, were affected by the "three-cavity catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shanno-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture, which prefecture Miyagi prefecture in Japan, which had both experienced the earthquakes and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages of Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had destroyed all the coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even that the prefecture of Fukushima experienced an atomic accident, so far alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shanno shows the progress made up six years after that progress has been reached in order to reconstruct the lives of the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese rebuilding authorities as well as the survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shanno-Zeitung reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (the end-end, sawai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi saw the biggest success among the three prefectures found Miyagi, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima happened at 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">It still laboured, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of Behelfsjjuutaku were converted into final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December of 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the evacuated from Fukushima still lives in emergencies, whereas Miyagi were more successful there. more than 75 percent of the evacuees were settled in Behelfswald, were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and daily life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shanno-Newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools have been affected by evil, their doors opened until December 2016, which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction of the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are back into operation, in Fukushima only 30 percent of fishing ports have resumed their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and nuclear accident, have moved to the three prefectures agricultural land in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the farmlands in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of land destroyed the farmland of Fukushima, lie in the "nuclergy wave zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered far back, but also Fukushima remained unbeaten here.</seg>
<seg id="567">Tourist tax in Miyagi and Iwate are back up to 90 per cent at the same time as before the misfortune. Fukushima, however, can have only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, Kahoku Shanno-Zeitung reports that almost half of the coastal inhabitants is almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to make their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared on the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine a total image, the newspaper conducted numerous evidence among the local population and below the evacuated by. she asked them about the state of rebuilding and as well as their indignation has changed over to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shanno-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimplico conducted a survey conducted by more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey presented that 83.1 per cent of local residents, measures taken in order to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents have not yet done enough in terms of catastrophes.</seg>
<seg id="575">As to those who are evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture,</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shanno-Newspaper has also been strengthened its attention to the position of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only see the massive earthquakes and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, disaster-causing, nuclear accident, to the Japan ever.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people back to Fukushima in a permanent replacement parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In catastrophic areas, most of the Evacuated ones are still known in Behelfswald, older than 50 years old. they must compete for the rebuilding of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is a building projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">If you meet people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one knows that one more binds more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global compounds are important as they require our preferences to enlarge our perspectives and recall that the world finally is very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look forward to these global compounds. in our Into the Deep podcast we will treat issues that will often get less attention than they earn.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember at a moment in which they have felt very strongly associated with someone in language and country limits.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Kriconi speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Violeta Camarasa remembers how the love of music worked in rural China; Adriana Macias speaks about the time where they worked with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experienced a wave of political power: here, the activist Guilherme was assassinated to his father, because he was attacked the Occupy movement of a WhatsApp group. here we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who was attacked by a policemen who was attacked by a policemen who struck him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police transferred to police</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil, where it came to protesters during the last Friday.</seg>

<seg id="617">Members of the Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso closed almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Gregorian parish church Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±ali, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as a Central Central and Spanish Sugar mill - regardless of that there is no significant sugar-harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane fabricites have been laid.</seg>
<seg id="629">Following the result, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the report was left of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be re-found.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some change the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others signed and commutes daily for factories which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, the crisis in the sugar pipe industry never screwed to his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that in the east of the region sugar cane factories, which are back into operation after long inactive days, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is sure to have heard that in MaÃ±alI would get the sugar cane Factory, but that promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resistance the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, poor administration and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvest is no longer a new question.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban Suggestion Industry?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the community saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The crushing of the sugar cane industry was economic need: the 155 sugar cane fabrication were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive, they were not competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories, annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased to roughly one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">Between 2017 and 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar level would generate at about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything ran well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "the day will go with safety into history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">The process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the Gregorian pipe factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich, May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene is known as a soldier, talking about the closure of the factory, the word that he is repeated, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Prior to the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially registered documents, which would only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed, addressat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ultimo Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could serve any removal of withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibility of responsibility and letters were always more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge for the shut-off factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for those in operation."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years waiting for retirement in another complex, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was in charge of his will at the standstill of the factory, whose construction he helped, took part in it.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part, which he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial sector in Cuba and the most important workpieces was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases there were no alternatives to work and services that genated the plants in the churches, in which they were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the mammoth speech of 21 October 2002, the former president in the eyes of the present people saw, when he guaranteed that factories had not been in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="679">In the area a food factory was created, whose production is not for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youngsters of the first Nations communities in the whole of Canada have to deal with topics that are important for them. they do with Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour we have been introducing mobile Tonstudios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups Songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the Pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in Nord-Quebec with ten cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus increases that young participates in conversations topics such as "cultural Identity, Language, Destroy, Love, Self-acceptable," or whatever is happening in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the history of highway 16, also called "Highway from tears," on which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were not resolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemkhi Cree First nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate, as important of the receipt of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the people of the First Nations have not always been mutiny-speaking.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation will be recorded, the refrain will be sung on cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The participating young people involved something from Gary Jolly of the Northstars Hip Hop group who gave them a stand in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan the strophe is available in the heading, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel that nobody would be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on the earth my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will take our cries.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">"" "" "" "but I believe that we will rise up one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So you can grow and lead them as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So you can do it, as determined by the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers that is exactly on the menu will be seen in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (in the end, the "Plastic Models of the dishes") are issued by any food that will be served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or continue.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokiabashi district of Kappabashi, there is a variety of these small enterprises that produce those plastic dishes made by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese people are these plastic dishes so usually that they don't have any more to everyone. a new trend, however, is turned into concurrent cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos depicting this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic geries decorated cellars, such as they are shown in Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed to a kitten collection, as in this case, coolers:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shoes coolers for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of Essentiers will increase increasingly.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular travel shell with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For these triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that contains your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon are used, a popular Topping, which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there is someone who say to say:" "" "Wow, cool, now I can embrace my mobile phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appetite form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the shape of schmelon ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handles made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">More skulrile plastic dishes can be viewed under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter on hashtag #. encircled.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports and foreign media about the infamous "struggle against drug trading" in Mexico the missists and casks regularly appear in statistics. however, these things do not reflect the extent of human tragedy that brings this battle with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa cartridge, pressed the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, barely any man looks at the grief or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each surroche, behind each bone remains in the hundreds of secret graves, stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug sales"), that they should give a voice and told stories of people in the fight between prosecutions authorities and cartons.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project as:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime may not only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The consequences are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if businesses are close because they are threatened by drug traders and all congregations will need to drive many kilometers in order to buy something as milk as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (german: "how fear live") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father, who searches every weekend secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost their father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "like every Sunday, we also prepare ourselves again to the task that we have started to go and go to graves after the people who we loved, we are looking for."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he was again back again, but he never came again. "Emma Veleta:" it is very difficult for me, because I am now with three children who need a education.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is also with me here.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You will be the insurance of my father, but they won't pay it out because they demand a dying.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get this? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those that are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state guide.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading of animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central Guerrero.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal than normal, in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have now known illness and Sensation journalism now for some years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass every day at newspaper kiosks and see the title pages with pictures, which actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from accompanies of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel the feeling when I am the only one I was wither or sad. it works as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be valid, or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is great. and it's not normal that people listen to the "heroic deeds" of the offenders, when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is that, when they had lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened to them too.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories come to bloom numbers in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the belief of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village that they had been justified." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to talk to that they are spared by such a tragedy if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of pressings in the Main region:" as a family with threats were plunder. "it describes how the armed crime month paid for month money from their business, until they had not only destroyed the business, but also her family had torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think all that you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never goes on, the trauma remains high, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">We further away from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed its report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want that the others are arrested, because you don't know when they run or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would solve my deep root feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot to live how to live. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he throws questions on how: who cares for the child of a mixed woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it, in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells himself that he had to kill himself, how to make a egg cocht, potatoes roar, Tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left Bone - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are irsignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother be gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years ago, when he had seen only a few blocks from his home, the bloody Leiche of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a pre-driving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez was as follows:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence caused by the organized crime and the struggle against existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of the civil council for public security and the government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor counted 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories who organized the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories are still alive in view of the new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those who we don't forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco", Animal PolÃ­tico 2015 established the data journalism project, whose aim is to observe the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading, which has tortured the country in the last four decades, in comprehension way.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the year after the first time emerged? content in social media, whether it is true or untrue, tend to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been utilised as a deception which took place in Nigeria or Myanmar since its first publication.</seg>

<seg id="823">It throws questions about our desire to search for pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker crossed the place of Sange in the East of the DR, kippte and exploded. 230 lives lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa had been neglected for years and thereby devastated. the streets in the region were become dangerous clads filled with impact holes that were difficult to ride.</seg>

<seg id="829">The houses sojourned and shortened bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to infirmity.</seg>

<seg id="833">It displays rows of carbonized bodies that are rounded up on the ground during the persons.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the history does not find their end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was wiped out several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but are not true, however, in the context of the tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the indigenous villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of grass, of which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained to count to count," "" "said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were ruined, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from satellite images could be presented in the following time.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unexplained, but the army point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram, to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture of the DR Congo again appeared as proof of the fact, and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image of the DR of DRC is only one in a series of failure; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was introduced as a cover for massacres.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments like this example, from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee hits, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported by violence against the Rohingya, Posts reported as the following that these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo gathered together:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidi-Arab news page that took part in 2012, the President Myanmars Thein was told, monks and politicians had involved in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the picture of the DR Congo to convert these information.</seg>

<seg id="858">Other news organisations which AFP were named as their source, had also attributed to His statement too, but did not see the picture of the DR Congo in connection.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false coupling sizes up to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere in all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "inverted picture search" you can see how far more information can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">A converted picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures below 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017) 344 pictures, which are very similar to the reported picture of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed masch private pages, platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="905">This right position, which is published only in English, contains references to counterfeit images of rumours that are operated and used by extremist groups to kill Muslims Buddhists and elsewhere (which is often used by burial nationalists).</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Thein was granted in 2012 that Monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of the Rohingya Muslims, and brought the story with the picture of Sange.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who had been killed by Boko Haram, published by the news page AnÃ¡lisis Digital, has expressly declared that the picture is not taken by the redness, but it claims that it was a "similar dschiavory attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">As the picture later, in connection with the massacre of Boko Haram, in circulation, the newspaper El Pais tried to contradict that there was connections to Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo appeared, provided with this twitterhashtag, and replaced a discussion on Muslims following the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and the stop on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities found this events that took place in the Islamist name, took place greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was widowed for the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 times save). but the messages that were associated with them were taken in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the target, attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reports in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="922">From the embassy that included the image from the DR Congo, the organization of Claretiner Missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">At other accounts, generators and pages in the following countries (on the portfolio in grey), Tinan also has no longer traceability: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>

<seg id="926">In all these cases, which had appeared only after the original accident of 2010, the image finally might be a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (irradiation) that drag them through. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of bigger discussions about silence in connection with Muslims, or - for the defense of Muslims - the murder of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how a African life is evaluated in comparison with a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understanding and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images can be used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">But a deeper question is, however, what happens if readers can't give this pictures longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are funny people who have unintended to comfort the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugars this mood are miserable and falsehood, that actual atrocities are untrue and tastes the actual groove of what actually happened in the DR, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">Dissemination images have already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the retention of pictures of a refusal does come to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that forcible images and spectators desperate and gave them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, seeking to help others to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">Whereas there are a lot regarding violent representations in the news media, the fact is that it is indispensable for the present news report.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologist experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you will thoroughly reconsider the situation in which an image can be interpreted in which it is actually replaced by the context or completely misused by the context or completely misused species.</seg>
<seg id="940">Each examination should be considered as internationally as international.</seg>

<seg id="945">Such words are available in each language: you press some situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakable words are already well-known (as the famous Portuguese acid) and others are rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist obstinate any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not sufficient, why a full explanation and sometimes something is required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">This unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists by Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu office, as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Bement your parents in recognition of how to have laboured in thy younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">Words in the Hunsrik Language which are spoken in parts of Brazil, as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- The comfort or sloth that you feel after being cured in cold days in the sun." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They grind other cultures, unveil other memory and weaving our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how to analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site would like to publish more of this "unreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way, here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone to enter into the connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the stories of stories in their original language is a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported a brief initiative of Steven Bird, the Unexchangeable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not written on the written but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has already been carried out since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The project is valid for the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we assume cities that accept diversity - safe environments where people do not forget to belong to these.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "they often listen to understand" "" "let these events instead" "" "hear these events" "", "to feel to feel to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, history counter will initially represent its history in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional history of history, their devotion and their representation is that the listens will be on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions appearing, the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the history of history, Rassiopou outlines the opportunity to explain the country's typical customs of customs.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fjord from the bunnies and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he explained the meaning of his fingernity, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a broad grin, he divides his feeling of inbreeding:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">To date, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can organize with TLS in contact to organize your own story guides.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a revision of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amount to USD 72 million on April 3rd, 2017, several religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the puertorian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The syring@-@ Palestinian Web developers Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for more than one year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and the campaign for his freedom continue and remember the contributions which he made for an open network.</seg>

<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, lases from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inch (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is licensed here, contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to create movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are associated with which this is associated.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activist, artist, designers, developers, researchers, researchers, researchers, who are involved in movements for free knowledge, have been working on page to view over the fog who gives our newsfeeds to create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of Adra prison, which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or position.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that want to release on his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel has a high price for its participation in a free culture, has many of us start to think about their own destinies, acts and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we now here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What to do we have decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What do we have given extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the website for Open Source and digital activist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military institution which was transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer in Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Based on the basis of a" strictly secret "was taken from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by individuals on 12 November 2015, having set themselves on the Insider of the Assad government and set them in an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His position and condition remain ununknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in making access to the Internet and to know the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently transfer the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the bass prototypes were predictive than the work that he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crosswise of numerous civilians and are merging Greek-Roman architecture types with hibery traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture, not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world embodies.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This striking train is created in the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be the public to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of an estimated value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">However, Bassel was able to unlock this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life to dream of liberty and Bashan taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bashsel brought me English to me, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read English well, writing and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge with everyone who asked him. he taught other inquiries to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened me the gateway to the technology. he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought the Internet to me.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He had also taken other inwarns, as they use computer at least theoretically, without that they actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They tasted the lyrics when they visited him, and he translated them from the Arab in English.</seg>

<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed by the regime through the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in detention since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many further people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption prosecutted director returned to the previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambians reacted with wrath on a corruption, in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state of the government, in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is here by Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other defendants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for violation of 54 million metical (approximately 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council was CFO Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and asked immediately his resetting to the company what happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Attorney General of the Republic, which impacted the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza, again to relate to his old post since the company was no discipline proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, shortly CIP), a local institution which convenes for public transparency, condemned the company's decision to set up the director in an interview with the Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a decline in relation to the efforts of our legal systems, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to know is that the company should have had a discipline trial against access.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently seems to be adequate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique social media, rejects this behaviour also as "contradially":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and to have taken half of it.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could have paid lectures and motivating speeches, he might be advised and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But as he is incompetent, he has ventured to be reintegrated into the company that he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is being paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not matter any mural:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he didn't believe him, that one has rewarded him to such a way that has already been rewarded so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morally to return and to serve the state, * he had already served as a unique opportunity to serve the state, but only himself served by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was used to use the state as a handsome of an inexhaustible money-source and the state itself is tired of this man wearied and sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this guy was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel, will not only remain as the first independent President in memory, but also as a sharp, concision, and - next to the prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous written representations, when he was energetically confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of everything, even the fatherland for its ambitions, to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he turns not from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious man is decriminated simultaneously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also disclosure:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat down 10 years and was free.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their post to the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although over the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian source, or in general as adjectively. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook disates the word "Kalar" or, (in Burmese) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hasstongue in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In the last few years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given an extreme sewered konnation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word which is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as Hasselt against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat Hasselt in Myanmar, the company has licensed a lot of sensual content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism in connection, but the Word of itself does not call automatically Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or doubts for purposes of his use, have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several burial words with basic meanings that have the same book sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair at Burmese also wrote 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words as' Kalar pae '(' aging), 'Kalar oat' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on the spiritual way, if they might know how he could linking his back pain when he made a word.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence KU la - "Cure" (KU) + the fraction (la) on Burmese - similar to the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win is the opinion that they must decrease in Hasselt's radical nationalists, but also stressed that facial must be analytic before it spread all the postcards that are out in the suspicion of pure, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you want to write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">In fact, what it should do, it is carefully to analyze and control it by checking the referenced words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar pae" "" "(chips)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-star nationalists are spread of Hasselt, a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action is going to send a strong signal to everyone who disseminate Hasselt, may not keep the efficiency of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship is often getting a Katz- and mouse game, whereby the users social networks can simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the scenic word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his post when he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attention to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the Word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and to me the liken, post and share of contents for 24 hours, because the post "the Facebook community standards cannot be enteous."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of postcards from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against Hasselt's radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, who has nothing to do with Hasselt:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hasselt from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author divided his opinion, why extreme nationalism and religious foundations were badly in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have to do more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community concerns:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a beneficial intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words leads only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support, as words as "chair" or "pean curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they did not have error, they didn't tried to report the due post.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only some respect for the 15 million benefits, which would have a big turnover, would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has drawn up for a lot of skiers under the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of serious, users are now funny via Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasselt to see if their posters will be taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook's, which had no hate-language, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission is used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch the pea curry and watch a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try out if Facebook contains the post that contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, with permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post states "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, with permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalistic Ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hasselt is to heat the violence in the churches in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, especially in the region of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands of escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On Facebook, Facebook has been criticized to his burial sites, criticized a criterion for his burial sites.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply did the word 'Kalar' too, it would have been better to have been closer to context than concentrating on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media motions that endeavaived, laws to the child before, followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they continue to support this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything was smooth.</seg>
<seg id="1351">An Hindu guide, e. g. had no concerns to say the critics of the children before, they should be damned by their own matters. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition was actually used for stresses in this actually uncomplicated thing and sometimes came doubts on whether the Opposition would agree to the bill of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the child before - despite 4 transformers (including one woman) of the opposition and an independent, that abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now, only the President of the country has to agree and preach the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's transformers have been released on Facebook with Facebook Update, Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the Children's bill was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes against it and none.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided previously in the Senate, the draft can now be transferred to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users was thrilled because the laws have been last changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who dressed a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary scede, which has swallow the core of the thing, but do you know what? the child is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's almost every prize.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was happy that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Ehegesetz has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for that - 0!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folding Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society that is quite open to it, how important is the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft summary was approved today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 members and 35 of them were present at the voting.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members elected to the law have approved for the law.</seg>

<seg id="1374">A thank you to our members.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But there is a possible hook in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Prior to months Maharaj has announced its intention to companies the judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and it seems to resolve his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a discerent of the law said it was quite lawful if Maharaj was accused against the law, most social media users would be subject to the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we are instead of talking about discussion so generally, in a way that we need to talk the state in our bedrooms, simply specifically talk about it that they may be misused by major, persistent males who are abused to them compared with their advantage, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial accusation against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children is legal or remains the norm, although there are laws that they may instruct them.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hackers controlled the office of the Prosecution in front of nationwide protest at the Russian National Day</seg>
<seg id="1383">Screen print of the message, which was posted on Sunday early on the site of the Yaroslavl district.</seg>
<seg id="1384">On the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption, which coincide with the day of Russia - Russian national holiday, the site of the Prosecution of Yaroslavl was chopped. the hacker have left a funny message "stay at home.</seg>

<seg id="1386">The hackers post the YouTube video "He is no dimmon for you" on the website of the Prosecutor with the following commentary: "the office of the Prosecution invites you to follow the citizen to follow the provocation and from all non-gentle events!"</seg>
<seg id="1387">However, at 11.15 the message was removed from the page - but in the middle memory, they remained.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Turkish users can view Wikipedia content through the mirrors of websites</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on January 18, 2012, and to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright law in the USA, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than one month, Turkey opened the popular and on the crowd sourcing principle based encyclopaedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "tag for day is clear how important the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporters and fans of TV series watches against plucleation.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technical users are used to block space tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times, that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most of the ordinary Wikipedia are not in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been unlocked by Wikipedia, as recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, you will find regular blockations of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the most massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform still remains closed, there are several Mirrorsides (pages which reflected the contents of Wikipedia and often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform submitted all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is unmistakable in spite of the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost report IPFS about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the messages (via the wave of Wikipedia), we set everything to read snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if they can not reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also gave that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and only for screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consuni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansikloach.org, an open source project that everyone can use such Mirrorsides to hoist when in the respective country Wikipedia is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consuni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Source: Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">It is ripens on another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server guides the request to the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are blocked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sum Giri was with the photos that he looked around, never satisfied. they were wned with poorly positioned motives and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to bear a camera to try and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, he endeavoured to bring Neptune, Nepas animal world to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that guides the attention of Nepals wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, how this first-class location helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what might be better for a passionate game photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home, when suddenly Navaraj (the Manager of the Chitwan Gaida), he had received a call from my father that would have been a Leopard on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I tried with my camera and was there in few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father loved him, and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was found and I immediately began to look back images too!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Soothills a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition of Nepals nature and would like to understand the understanding that wild animals are not so fearful as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know, because he had already stood by face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not disturb your flocks by the opinion of sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was because of darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he immediately tells us, and let us go through the Sal-Trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Says placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click on environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He was waiting for 22 days, and lived in a tent to take in Bardia National Park recordings of Otter. up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, who live in the vicinity of the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was posted by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was released here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, there are women with greatest care to discuss the names of their husbands, or even from older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a Printers or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Checisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect them as well as fear of the social pressure, as well as fear of consequences they should preserve the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian State of Ostraa by a headcourt and by her family and the village community after she had spoken a secret relationship with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of her marriage did not believe in the name, is also common among men. however, they have far less conceivable to fear, if ever, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health care as well as housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main focus of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the hostile of the patriarchate alone.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which there are in 13 Indian countries, it is part of the campaign # Khelp Badal that is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and relies on the dismantling of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices such as children's home to the ban of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs were created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time for ambassador of the mural.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion round, traded by women who do not name their husbands on their name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided to have opted for this subject, because they wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not according to the names of their husbands, there is a roman that they pleaded not guilty to all the demnity, and have never been questioned in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't keep this, is regarded as a woman without morphal.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never seen through this discussion round about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted to never before her husband's name until now, at home, tried to try at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law is still long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned back to me, saying, I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">This self-confidence in the luggage started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had ever heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After video projection the women tried to bring the discussion with a practice in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant in the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, offended, sad, lovingly, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us, meaning that they would not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husbands on her lips," Rohini Pawas out of the village of Walvis in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which women never have married the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">One woman was so shy that during the whole exercise just before himself, a second decided to let the whole wasted frustration against him and let his family leave to curse him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In addition to this, with an ancient fires, the women decided that they would actually try to try her husband at home to name her husband at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what the ideas answered the women in the head: his wife couldn't stop his name to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother exhorted in law, she got afraid, and told that it was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said" I should do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">An husband of an attendance was less intelligible and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the fascination red spot on the forehead, who shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the fascination red point if he also died.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard that, to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not have to hear that, but mine, they are now in a better position, to choose it in some days not to wear.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at each discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want that the women make sure what could hear what could hear, "says it.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, she celebrated their own birthdays with cake; she dances and sang and talked about things that they had never done thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working for many years since so many years and yet I have had some things, for example, how our identities are linked to our husbands, never honest honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have talking about the concept of honor, and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been carried by Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is the okay, but some wanted a Salad-Kurta, a long shirt over a trousers, carry it not.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of their own clothes, the morals are connected to the saris and much more, tasted cruini in a discussion round, so that women could bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can take Jeans and Rohini is sure to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months has already been changed since their first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things begin to come into rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but they listened to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">One or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; one or two women have now carry out Zinnoberrot at their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion club know that the changes that they want to reach in their lives - how to get more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By doing each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How raw ini declared:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman walks in the club home and others tell others what we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question might be stupid, since Singapore is recognised as an independent state since Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered to be a city in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting at the international biennial Association of the State of New York, the Minister, that many people criticized the Dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He undersupport that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked if New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people go to a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "to turn the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and promises to create this valuable land, we hear that we're not going to be no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had the licence of a flight before the responsibility, a mandatory infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons given by Shanmugam were not very Nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of which he appeared uncertain undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally as well as cities that are permanently led to the party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the subject of the subject, the good old Leier from the authorized distributors go to the pre-release Democrats, leaving the turned logic, because they fit better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final day of Shanmugam, we were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judikative, our political system really not answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Relevant questions will be rational with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls to Shanmugam on his opinion, because they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city is, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our werder K Shanmugam would like to clarify this point if he was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog his comment posted on the reviews that you should start to read the entire co-address of the conference, so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore would be a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he stated why the elections in Singapore would be so easy, even if we are looking forward to free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He moved Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said to Singapore," "" "No land," "" "he did not sense to this meaning!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over Shanmugam, who makes the leader in a growing generation, making such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about that which said the Minister of Justice in Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and members of the old garde that awaits me - be understood with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubt and I am not even sure whether he really believes it, and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review dislays the weaknesses of Shanmugam Argumni:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr Shanmugam "committed a mistake" or was it a Freudscher spokesman?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government Cabin, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of serious significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do they live in their military service, they defend their city but not their country?</seg>

<seg id="1730">This set seems to have many more people more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know itself, there is little that distinguishes us the Canadian of Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the real problem exists that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing, at which one can meet.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants which cross Europe or Latin America, certain places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is guided by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals pink Brillary base and gold coloured ear studs in teddy bular form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many among the name Mom Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) became a target for Afrikaner and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, grinding, crumbled walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of african and haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells the people in full minibus and from the upper part of the coast to call it: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you my mom Africa?</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She would like to reject us.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them, and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medicines that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived at a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama is a reasonable first name for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Joghtened stache), with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel that it suits you, that African women are very nice women." ""</seg>

<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels to Boston with his sister, hopes to go to Boston to return to her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but is it for some Africans, which are on the way to the United States, normally a first stop in South America and then turn to the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other trailers of Mama Africa. "Mom Africa is a well-known name on the route," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Afrikaner's often travel along the route and that Africans speak on WhatsApp of Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his captivity, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builders on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy has been weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest in Mama Africa for the months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mom Africa is our mother and we never leave it again," "" "he answers." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells that their guests often send text messages when they continued to greet them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They declared that her Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught them to prepare chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only radio hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a cul-asse leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter was added to Valenzuela and his family migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the Bustickets are sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to receive an appropriate prize, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 persons, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cookery outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells me. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and help others. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his place.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of the people who wanted to replied with him without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a sole, has offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and try to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, the travellers are quiet their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has spent 20 new guests, a majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostalgically, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she flashed her in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hairdressing, which you made a spine, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughed at her, while she briefly presented her.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A Check-Point for personal communication appliances in Xinjang from Twitter users enquired period.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users received a mobile phone in the Tianshan district of Urumqi, a mobile phone notification in which she shows the District government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the notification, it is said that the app" "" "may" "" "to get access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities, however, has the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women have been arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had previously installed the app, messages with a private weaving group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification of the police, the app stand that the app and the distribution of the terrorists would determine and persecute, together with "illegal religious" activities and "damaging information," including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service system with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking pornographic webpages, by online fraud, Troians and Phishing pages to make users attention to make sure how much time they spend online, and control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors shall help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can naturally be used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" or even hacker able to manipulate home network to manipulate or steal home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements concerning digital censorship in China mostly focused on the experiences of users in the major cities in the East and South, the reality is much often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit the rest and dissatisfaction in the conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme poverty and monitoring measures as well as routinely Internet banking.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter-based media Outlet "images from the China" (current survey), which was censored news in China, showed photos of a Checkpoint where the policemen have subsequently checked the residents when they had the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that the people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">Mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a Checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a blow for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You are forced to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from the Republic of China" (enlightened), in addition, a Jingwang-product description published that the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang will be easy to use in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city party, to minimize illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branch, authorities and associated facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office when running their computer and communication appliances.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report from Freedom House, a US-American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the assignment to all residents and entrepreneurs, to register their "personal ID cards, cellphones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media cards" by local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy them. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole range of other potential income, including such that refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2063">Any voice in me said that I had to be accustomed to me or displeased, although I had nothing done to earn this sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to rip myself as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He called the lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably originates from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henker will learn to your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure you with him, and you will not withdraw your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cries were not enough for him, so that they did not divide the reed through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In my first day of arrest I asked me if the investigator had worked earlier than garbage, or whether it belonged to normal working configuration.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables in each other to present themselves from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Three of them will be changed within one hour, while I was still in the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice I heard.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker noticed the cooling and found no pleasure in all, so he was the next to a electrically charged staff.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity through my whole body, enough to supply my whole quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-bare body, which lay out on the ground was the perfect power conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The divers vanished and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he met his duty for these night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep on me again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed away, which came before me as few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then call for the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light fulfills the room ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"" "I am answering the voice of a troubled young people:" "" "my lord, my father has to worry about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and keep you, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always released me.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam hdaib smokes a cigar in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">This photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam hdaib recovers the most of its time inside; times he plotted to his screen, time to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But after that you can leave a cigar between his fingers, or his lips with nicotine fleeing lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house, which had belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they had lived as felaheen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib is a passionate activity, which is transferred to the conservative majority against gender roles, sexuality and free expression of expression by art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music that places often with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry. all these issues are not only found in his hometown of Amman Relevance, but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as a man who is not restricted by boundaries, and he can feel at his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it isn't open it openly, he turns against US American foreign policy, a special appeal.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas, something like he was born in Jordan as "Palestinian Powers" - so he himself, even though he was born in Jordan and never before being in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life," emphasises Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think that I am a man, while he dissolved in water" "" "NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan. in this time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise until sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sensitive Junitag had little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the pieces of warm coffee and the waist of the Kent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when one throws a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to do not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections which support the Islamic Act of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of homosexual frontsers Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country, is contradicting and the main reason for the concert tabs.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former pressing of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many of them also claim that the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more hazardous activism that provides the most proven legitimacy regimes in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila was the progressive people as "progressive support of human rights," which still has decided to use "an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply called Rhetoric, but actually a clearer reality is reflected in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs plant clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In the year 2016, Hdaib traditional gender norms to the body by giving his vision of the fate of Arab women who have voiced sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the Skeleton of a obviously unknown woman, whose arms and legs ends up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by hands of those who actually should trust in confidence.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of 'honorary moral' - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch, according to Human Rights Watch, reached its zenith in 2016; however, Jordan was still missing that Jordan was missing the institutional infrastructure to support the victims, victims of murder, or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to uninterruptions from 1954, women who are exposed to a danger of indefinite violence, "and for their release is often a year-long bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music is delighted with great popularity and is well-known for this, also in front of topics, which are as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib claims that his work is politically, however, is that he is able to separate his music that is full of explicitly on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">In me, politics was told, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed", Hdaib takes the question after the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically politically, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">A verse is often repeated in this song:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further development of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind market, in which one can get, in his words, "what you want" - be faith or non-believing, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that barely any man talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality between LGBTQ + individuals still censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya in order to notice that his comments were torn out from the context, revsted and his opinion was censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but stretched it only an amended version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib advertises the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intolerance compared to homosexuals did not talk to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nui, a poet of the eighth century, who still has remained in remembrance thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuvo, who would like to work once in order to work in order to write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why are Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib did not have anything with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled to do.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemic kingdom there is nothing new, that the government attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service resumed several former government members and members of the Lecturer, with the grounds, they had expressed himself in social media criticises the problems with the deeply rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">According to what is the concert of Hdaibs, only the top of the Eisbergs - the actual challenge is to act a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent type and take a gig. Jordan has got a gig now for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks for slow, bedtime and intra-changes. he is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, were coming from a Arabian world without interventions.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreamed not only that his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region with the help of music, art and literature will be a real and basic openness - and not by bombs, streumerable and artificial type herent Democrats. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is far, Hdaib will continue to pass, and thus also resist the resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis reporting, which belongs to the Aman as student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant warks are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebula Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which was also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the drums and dancing were over a thousand years, in the armies from the West Japan in the northeastern China to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi to force the knee.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a few great seats, therefore we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking back to the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebula Festival is the only truth - and to spend a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18-meter car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyle of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), and Neymar (Brazil), has led to give himself more normal citizens to the experienced hands of hairstyle, which can make this increased hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyle, which go to the extreme borders of imagination and creativity, even has an annual event inspired to contest the hairstyle "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalvo.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the amended version of the "Liebesambassador for guerrilla" in guerrilla "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The post is published here within a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it a lot more important, people who feel it out, affection for us?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question went to the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the Foundation Bogotart and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, who inspired them to the campaign cartas por la ReconciliÃ³n (Letters to Reconciliation), young people to encourage young guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, her country was the place of a historical event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after the long negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla Movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered as meaningful that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Colombian, there is a long way until you can talk about a real reconciliation and peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla soldier, who lived in illegitimate camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and contributed around the clock to integrate their weapons again in life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society again who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, it has to record into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young columnans would have to close together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what did they do: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla regime in order to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla, which will then be handed over.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Prize winners who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk just with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people whom we love to write on the Day of thousands of love letters, but those forgotten that they need much need.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He was telling that he continued to share his love with people in this year, breeded the most urgent matters.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now will find their place in the company and have to build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make a discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on 19th March in one of the UN camps.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotart Foundation in the camp to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set up on how they had done earlier in order to meet the orders of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all participants. "it is incredible how many different feelings one can run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between lies" telling the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governors of the Valle del Cauca Province, described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambook" (a kind of tent, in which the guerrilla boys live), I saw a guerrilla soldier, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to enter, because beside him on the bed a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Dornthigh.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I asked him," "" "hello, what are they just?" "" "he answered:" "" "I am answering a letter which someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never, in my life, someone has written something so beautiful, therefore I am going on. "since I suddenly ran tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I troubled him, and set me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I'm sorry for all the years of the faithful companion of this cat, and would help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had to join the FARC, the only possibility to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive myself for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company outside, who waits with open arms for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"" "" "" "until now I have only learned how to handle weapons with weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is prevailing, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New votes</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and some leaders of the FARC came together at a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grew up as a war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leader of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and insight into their views on the peace process: "many years we have experienced, how to develop the social injustice by the state of the state to develop a political party, we can help to create a political party in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a target of this size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people have never heard, who had never heard their hearing, and did not know that people who have often seen as a monster, and even hated even people with great feelings that were turned through their lives and its environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The truth, in which the country lives, does me hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comfort me that all men - also those who have killed and have caused much damage to bring with us and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote to the example of DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalvo, the archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was prophesied that after deforestation would be peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will be always people who are ready to seize, and to protest their rights, and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology belong to them - are talking about all those who are dreaming of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know from your own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend the lives as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles on our way, but we will overcome them together.</seg>

<seg id="2244">With terror, activists have experienced the coverage of the last months over the persecution suler men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, which is like a Damoclonal value on the local LGBTQ community, was not only done over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grozy who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about it what happens in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ-legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines after several months, after reports were published that dragation, torture and killing queer males in the Republic of thematic areas.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milkina in Nowaja Gaseta, and she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, who took part in secret prisons and killed them in secret prisons.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">As early as early childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they became adult, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechnanenen was opened by the genealogy of her estate, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She went from fear of her life in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a transverse that appears in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone did, from whom I thought, he would be a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere in the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sicked them on his tashic friends, with the following message: "then there are no men going to remove this disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made by all Whatsapp the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a few shopping street from the back of my car, I heard a male who say: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned back, I felt something in my body, but did not hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on tushi: "how long will you honour the family yet?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I knew not the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and awoke last end of the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had to get everything and started shout.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had taken two samples in my right pulmonary wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nursors they were laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name; but the doctor stopped and laid me in the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, stranger, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a Alphams.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">To send me back to Chechnya, to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd receivables: some said me, I have to prove it, that I had not changed in the official television in Grozy, saying that I did not change my sex that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say in TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family tries to deal with this print?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people spoke to my mother at the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world, but not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she placed a knit around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, I was clear that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My Human Rights-Friends reprove the numbering of the numbering - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give their names, but I will say that I remember it all, they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something annoying happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still cannot understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it, without permission, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe in safety, only because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you push. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is Number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was really my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the sexual activity, that's a table topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally casccasian elements, I still carry out in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very much I wish I can't overcome this sealgic barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I say always that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we make with camera, I really give me about how the person is out of their past, thus it is reminiscent of my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who has spent one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan it had not been arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan was hardly able to wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So that I, they invite you to load the relatives with the affected person, and at the end require a proof that the so-called "honour" has experienced by blood genugtuung.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are they now weakened in these secret conditions now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says it wasn't very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, especially those who have no rich relatives, or who have dropped from their relatives to present the Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there to present them later than terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be brought down, they will show her body in television, and claim that they had attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"" "" "" "as if these men had not simply disappeared, but specifically to dipped themselves." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a mutation or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just got someone who had been imprisoned for a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after her beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was taken away when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, they were not yet introduced as bandits, but there were no reports so far. we assume that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not allowed to shave this man?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation which took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always bore my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in the very Grozny when I still lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the aria was applied, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia wanted to lead us to "civil king" at the time, but he finally threw us back to the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted, I had colored eyelashes, bore tubes and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Department of Department of Sharia has never been glued to me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met with me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks arose, and the whole city knew about it, why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speeching: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't go beyond the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it often to children, if they make the sick of sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply shut up their eyes before you, because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never chased and never smitten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this ministry start?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, until Kadyrow stood on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about Moral in TV.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not to us by se, but foremost on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who suffered before and raised up, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel as the situation in the Republic steadily disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go after?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I still worked as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicates with them as a type psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize Teetreffs, conventions, I begged them to the hospital and help them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't forget any cent.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people, when I did excuse the fluency.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: apply a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is alms.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is the nature that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to make you with foam before the mouth that there is no oscillation with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which the Cabardiner have, who also have Russians; on all the planet, there are they - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is very pleasant, so what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many guys from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think of transidy of men, the men love, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a Trugutter.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact, different habitats.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm sorry that I'm so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not very sad - I know that I'm now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups Able before an increase of self-moral within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high occupational health and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the past months, there is a strong increase in self-moratorium.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27 came back the two situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahraz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under attackers, depression, and he stooped for his own help, to get inability for his family, so Ahwazi-Human Rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">One on YouTube shared video kept the moments after he had attached itself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it quickly to delete the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources the burns were so strong that doctors could not do any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only one committed suicide in August within the Arabian Ahwazi minority, and activist activists before that even more men could take the lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights told that this month some other - Hamid manifest, Ali Hazbawi, Sayyed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a matter together: they were all family-perpetrators, who, due to the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and incapable, to nourish their families and a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment, and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a majority of the Arab Ahwazi community, was struck by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">Before a century, the Arab Ahraz was a mainly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi-monarchy took power and undertaking great efforts to terminate ethnic autonomy throughout the whole Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran present oil and gas fields as well as some of the most common and valuable useful space for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continues to grow slowly, and the native population receives only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi Arabs systematically, in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has a large number of demons, the water of the Arab regions in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are round.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These demme only led to destroy the devastation in the region by drought, and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-youth rose to 81% now.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general manager for Kocher, work and social welfare, told that 5% of the Ahwazis who completed a work that completed elementary school, 55% of secondary school completed and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A systematic strategy... it aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance "</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activists in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," to a "high rise" in the number of self-moratorium among young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Kenimi said that particularly the unemployment has got worse. due to this, a combination of a high number of in Ahwaz newly founded ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functional and institutions preferred not to work in Arabic working forces, the local Arab Ahwazi will deprived the access to work possibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of systematic politics of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs, and to force them to earn their habitable outside of their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their advantages and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as the Arab names are not tolerated, because the speaking of Arab language or Tracking Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must bear the human rights activists, before the situation exploited.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait for whether the world awakes and knowledge.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of comments written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments using the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a feminine, many women - especially white women who designate themselves as intersectional feminists - with Frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even think well-thought scientific and social arguments from me, why I should be feminine and why we should be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money in spite of similar formation as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under stringent observation, unless they are going to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards ensure that women had to stumble or later in various areas of life to a glassuring blanket, and that discrimination based on sex still attracts across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I am doubling twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to skin colour, on penitism, on black cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention, what kind of being physically, seducal and verbal have been misused, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - together should come together to sing "their voices, and" Kumbaya, my Lord 'to sing "to get the equality (some) of the women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that there are in addition to sexualised violence an associate form of self-motivated violence which we are exposed to black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migration background more often the school will be interpreted as white girl, due to obvious integration issues.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spears and women with migration background a higher risk are suspended, domestic violence and violence to suffer from the partnership as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand I want to join all men, all men, and all men of any skin. on the other hand, I cannot join me as a black woman, whose centre is the white woman, who refused to take into consideration of their thinking in their thinking, which relate to both gender and skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white feministic-oriented spies that has always turned me and countless other black women always.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851" "" "In their speech," "" "I am not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to justify a ideology in which the black woman in a historical respect is a horrible and marginalized beings." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me group, which also absorb our customs and customs to drive their egoeccentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I'm not trying to push white women the importance of overlapping of skin colour and gender. because some of them will continue to overcome the importance of black women for feminist movement dead, no matter how many black women are trying to honor them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give a home to women to be a home and engage by white feminism, is still the word "Feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I am going to resolve me full and entirely of feminism and join me the movement of the Womanism, to use my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of me for a white-feminist paradigm, that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in our own ideas and will give us to the dontics that will be created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana Falls: Reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism) says that we can defend ourselves to our own species. and not only that - black women can also realize in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, seelian, physical and even the spiritual elements can be admired that make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, I pray you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures because of the paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I'm recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradise.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in a environment, neither ignores my life nor ignored, nor denied.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" by Kurdish. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weilichunefraubin), who reported on violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protection of affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner Ada BÃ¡ez said that she was nothing against Luis Balbuena, her expartner who had become a violent company.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of its relationship has gone some time and the police said, their statement would be laid down to the action, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena did not consider for abuse, also the acute indication of Ada BÃ¡ez was nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman returned to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Teufelskis of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women once ad once ad, they do not receive support by the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men that they misuse. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit violence to be victims of violence at all in the prosecution authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Ingredients and Statistical 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that nothing under immune laws: good approach, lack of implementation and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It's hard to determine how many women really misuse, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for comateries at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports, which show not even to the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General Attorney came to 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads when the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence. also here 86% of ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women who were physically harassed, 55% of women said of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">This statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayical Women's Minister Ana Baiardi will actually appear only a few of this offences. "on each woman who is reimbursed in Paraguay for mental abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On each woman who reimbursed for physical abuse are reimbursed, two women who do not do this, "explained at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">As women's suicide in Paraguay cannot be inadequate, the prosecutions authorities cannot be inadequate, as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 journalists there were at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinators for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases, in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies due to violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the fixed girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that they called his name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning it was not really wanted to do that, but after that, however, it was for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together. but for two years she bore the psychic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would have become a victim of abuse once.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read it earlier, I always thought that the only women happens to undergo the ones, because they let go out of violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about failure by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his insulsions and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered on their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorisch if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to be a form of mistress.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long of Carlos, and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like that they wanted to say that victims of Missions could have at least a certain co-debt.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not of Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that her former partner did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all involved in some sort of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can speak with others about their experience, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their prosperous partner even managed to convince them to convince them.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias displays with the authorities without result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against its former partners, who developed into an unsearchable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country, where it was mainly for money, power and the influence of its former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws, which are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The display of missions is a way full of resistors and a fight against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for women in Paraguay, looks also great problems in the application of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the Hashtag # PorElla (# Interpack).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# NonEasy) are part of a campaign based on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law looks to explain the Female in an autonomous criminal offences and harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislative text was altered in some points to win the deputies for the law, that the way for decriminalization of abortions, which are generally banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had provided the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which must bear the victims of violence at present themselves, if they simply receive instant indication and secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature has no sufficient financial resources available to:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreate is seen as a part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a change must take place, that violence is no longer regarded as a little standardization.</seg>
<seg id="2537">He who disappointments in view of these facts is guilty and also contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to be so long display, until mistress does not apply more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the paraguan Senate. previously, parts of the law have been modified. in this case, a passage was cancelled, which called partners in cases of domestic violence.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"this website was closed due to a decision of the Information Minister," at the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than one year ago, the omanic authorities closed the independent Arabic newspaper Azamn in the Sultant because of their coverage of corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison, where he is a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and lodged in court, but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power since 1970, after he had made his father, Said ibn Taimur, who had turned off by a state mark.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chief of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Ottoman Sultan's rule is characterized by the destructive efforts of security forces, in particular in the domestic service, including freedom of freedoms, disagreements and defenders, independent journalists, Blogger and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restricting peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and activists, their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online as well as offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the execution of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the freedom of press in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari announced that an article entitled "High-ranking Parties" hands of the Justice "was published in the newspaper on July 26, 2016. this went to corruption in the judicial authorities and the mixture of high-level civil decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure, to raise a judgment in an inheritance.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, member of the editorial committee, was charged to the special department and detained by security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS was appointed Deputy Chief Editor Yousef Al-Haj, who had directed to Al-Maamaris Festing as Chief Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed on uncertain days after the Minister of Information had given the statement that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on any way, including online, from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the court took place in Maskat the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted among others due to disruption of public order, "misuse of the Internet" and "sub-excavation of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of violation of an Publication and the Publishers.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj have been sentenced to three years of penalties and fines in the amount of 3000 oman Rial (7800 US dollars), and a year-old forbade was imposed against the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine penalty of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after taking the use of "an information network for spreading material that could represent a danger for public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri a damage deposit of 5,000 omanic Rial (13 000 US dollars) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court said Al-Abri on 26 December 2016, sentenced Al-Haj sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he allied his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also lifted up the decision of the information security to close the newspaper "Azamn".</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the Court, Azamn again allow the newspaper to be exposed to attacks by the omanic government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information received a statement with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information signed a further statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and thus the Minister for the decision of the Appeals Court presented the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases, in which Oman at the youngest time the press was hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For example, for example, the closure of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continuous closing of Azamn and the detention of journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the ombian authorities are still not ready to prepare an extensive violation of the Press Freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the omanic authorities to:</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rarely or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need in front of the site. there are two reasons: for a lack of global healthcare system many medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and Malaria have far more serious effects than elsewhere in the poorest countries of Africa and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by pharmacies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, with its own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Sambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched on HIV virus before being decided to go back home to support the sambische healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and on misunderstanding of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warriors speaks private people).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warriors RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the samic National Programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB, and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions to what we have been developed.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always be recipient to stay instead of myself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get are often used in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is to find appropriate scientists for projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It's difficult to find people who come back or come here, because financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs plenty of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is demand for special academic education, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research on the space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit of it very well.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientist in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the full access to scientific expertise that show here challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are available only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seeds produce worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine created by solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred for Salad in the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as outredness, the first plant, which has grown from NASA astronauts in space and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Mortons's work was only bound by his own incorruption and the question as many salatvarieties can get set limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s it noted that more salads were patented, so that it could not continue to breathe out.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only suitable for individual types, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special Rotor or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last few years, more such patents have been registered to more plants such as cereals or cartons. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmental protection and experts for food security ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton is still a salad, but he still needs more restrictions as well as his work is still further worth.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is in a river a boulder which I must have shaker." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we must make this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "says he." I think this patents have to go to salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the judgment, no one can breathe out any new salad because all features are already patented. "he makes so good as possible and tries to recover the characteristics that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavoured to use no material that is protected as a spiritual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is increasingly larger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeders).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have red Roman salads in the "greenhouse" of the station farmed and eaten. it is tested to be cultivated if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It's no coincidence that this name would be so sounds like the movement from the IT area, and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as a spiritual property and can be used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, shortly Ossi, US breeders could undertake to use himself that other seeds may have been cultivated in them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they can do with their seed well, and they can sell it. "open source" breeders allow others to cross your seed, to cross your own varieties, and it is not immediately expelled - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plants.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scaffold prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Executive Committee, Jack Kloppenburg are control of seed well and the opportunity to breads new plants as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds plays to him a role in larger merging such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter no or only little while breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "for example, what is good, locally and sustainably certified organic farming, such as it is offered on peasant markets, should also know that the species is bred to itself as this vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition sovereign without seed sovereign sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to provide other seed well as freely available. in contrast, their approach is to patented, seed well and vegetable features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argued that the future of the food supply is endangered, as the available gene pool because of the always numerous new spiritual property rights on plant material, which thus always is limited, unreadable.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it took out that about one-third of all cartoning features are protected as a spiritual ownership, making it not only worth in plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are no estimates not yet, but experts such as Luby means that massacred plants as wheat are still sized patinated, as a salad or carrot.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants will be bred so farmed that they provide specific features - by such that their taste or their colour has improved until such, due to them flourish and threats like pests or diseases such as pests and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders by more and more patents are currently increasing. genetic variety is currently necessary than ever before, because the changing conditions in climate change are much worse than ever.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto is that genetic diversity was generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States, the company established itself for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is however, however, the view that intellectual property will promote other breeders, da "patents and the protection of plant varied innovations." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection was not inhibited innovations, but promotes them to be provided by the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks for the other way: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly there is no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for so long, on plants can be adapted to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general good and still should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetaries are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate farmers their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That's it, which drives us, and it's impossible to use it, if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In all, Morton is concerned with the concept to patented plant features: "we do not create the features really itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make them away, and as breeders we had no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi Executive Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who chased a variety, strives its own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation, herbicides are needed, who are breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is precisely genetically modified." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets but smaller than such as Monsanto are) patents, it will create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject the patented or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for Salads in its breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that trains by the Avoid of vegetable patented innovative would: "it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a constantly new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years itself, "says he." with a patent is protected for 20 years before competition, where you simply make my opinion very nice. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the United States seem to be a leader in the "Open Source" breeding, but the concept spreads very quickly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources, an "open source" seed program works through farmers together with farmers, helping them to breads new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports you to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agree works on an "Open Source" license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, in due to the Ossi obligation can not simply be acquired one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patentable. thus, it concerns the current practice of the European Patent Office, the patents applied to conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not yet no law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent to this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos hosted a conference on "Open Source" seeds and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from across East Africa to learn about the "Open Source" seed movement and the global trend towards the patentation of seed products.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"" "Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's" "" "Open Source" "" "program for" "" "Open Source" "", "that the organization is currently a worldwide alliance of" "" "open source" "" "seeds for the planned next year of the official starting signal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit-development organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed well-map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of Essential, was published by McKnight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have to come to produce, to exchange and to improve seed policies, so that a stable supply of food supplies can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">This report also emphasises the importance of a varied, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection, by Luby Ossi, hopes that soon more people will be recognizable soon.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and Blog are the newest targets of the Censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This sometimes it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 05.August the Egyptian government stopped the website of the network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which has documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network released a statement on Facebook which criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">In spite of this attack, the Network for Human Rights Information remain - despite this attack and the Constitution in the Arab world, in this part of the world, it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities would be exhausted to overcome and not follow. we hope to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities have blocked 21 pages of websites, like bassist the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave trap to the victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt in the blog of the columnists and Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the spread of column and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, whom he set up in order to circumvent the zensurion of the Egyptian government, even the goal of a attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, who is native to Ziadas blog, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he participated in the student protests and executed a video like the police of physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article is mainly turning around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed the rejection of the government and reflecting what does it mean for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs, blogging is very old but has nevertheless been priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi. and even if the blocking of the blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is it for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is possible to give me the feeling of a siege of siege to me; an arrest, a sual murder, preload on the national Security Council, the blocking of Blogs and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I wrote not for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post the item of articles to get the zenensorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mud leave the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities opened from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in the network of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the plumbing of providers which was possible by changing Internet-sur and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th, we felt like the blocking of websites that started VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block contents and filters to block the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally worsened that the interest rates are met behind closed doors, thereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with the help of this acts against this acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we didn't close our eyes in front of the grave.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes declared that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a warfare in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist reported that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 territories, which are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>

<seg id="2768">It is aware that a war discourse when it is distorted, even though he can be used, atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then ask questions to betray.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partner.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the name "War" more than it profit?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist in CecÃ­lia Oliveira to describe the violence as "War" by the media and might make it difficult to move the responsibility of the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - as an extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, lightenment and a historical and self-neglected public service.</seg>

<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux wrote from one of his article in 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention on the criteria of the "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
