this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he wrote spectacular , that the N@@ SA illegal phones of Americans .
it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US intelligence service in which the CIA was literally delivered to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if the crazy sounds , you can read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know what the chapters isn &apos;t pleased ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has been determined against cr@@ ises and called him to name its inn@@ um@@ erable sources .
in this train , he became the symbol of the government of the government to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if the media does not receive this information , and if they don &apos;t protect the identity of the mud , they will cost .
so when the government struck in R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ te@@ ens did before him : he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was so with the risk to go to prison .
but then , only days before the trial , something unusual .
suddenly , even though it were lon@@ ging for years , the requirements of the government were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters and sources can be stopped .
instead of failure and cr@@ ises to bring the statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ator , without his consent , his telephone numbers wor@@ ried about ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its lending service , and even travel transactions with the list of his flights .
in the middle of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ s .
unfortunately , that is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the Justice has more condem@@ ns more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how it can be a problem , especially because the government has a lot of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government always has more possibilities to draw all .
but just as the technology of the government permits to handle the rights of rep@@ lic@@ ers , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can contact it from the moment in which she can contact us , rather than in the case , in the testimony .
today there are communication software that it was not written than R@@ isen his book , and it &apos;s much more saf@@ er than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source code system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s most famous , which has been developed by us in the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been developed further .
instead of send an e @-@ mail to send you on a News website , as the Washington Post is here .
there you can upload documents or send documents , as in any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and saved on a server , which only has the relevant News Agency .
so the government can no longer create more information , and many of the information that would request it would not be available from the previous set .
Secure@@ Drop but is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments develop new sp@@ y technologies around the world , which are all at risk .
it &apos;s possible to ensure that not only technology rules such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to apply mis@@ ses . it is the same important that we protect the next decade .
the ab@@ norm@@ ative of abuse during the supply of soldiers white and of over@@ crow@@ ing hospitals . or the next environmental staff , the alarm to se@@ wage water from Fl@@ int . or a wall @-@ Insider , which war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data collection of the history was published . &#93; &#91; the &#93; Panama Pap@@ ers &apos; un@@ veil that rich and mighty &#93; &#91; enormous money sum@@ s in tax@@ o@@ oses have been hidden . &#93; this week , we asked by News about a che@@ que of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s local law firm Mos@@ cow@@ ca .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax phases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will receive an impression of what clients , banks and lawyers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like Mos@@ aics Fon@@ se@@ ca Go and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you do that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , we actually see the emails , exchange messages , how the whole system works , how it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is returned .
there are also reports that a prohib@@ its of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad brie@@ fing companies in tax phases .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be there a lot of rich people and others giving nerv@@ ous to the next release , and to the next un@@ veil documents .
now it sounds like the plot of a agency , or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ ROM .
it seems w@@ ells from you , myself , unusual people .
why should we choose what ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty in the situation are able to hide their assets under control and not all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , streets .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ vel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , like secret tax@@ o@@ es are used by some few , their assets to hide and to swal@@ low -- something that we discuss and reveal ourselves for ten years .
I think many people appear very conf@@ using , and it is difficult to understand how these control rooms work .
I always have a matter before .
so one company in another company , in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand , who is behind this building .
it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is .
I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there have been no prominent American Americans , which came to this revelation in this sc@@ and@@ al .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax phases .
but by the principle , after which this tax phases work , Mos@@ cow@@ y has less American customers .
we would have a much more cases and examples from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that you need to specify less information in some U.S. states , to establish a company than to get a library of library .
this type of transparency in the US has to allow employees of shoul@@ ders to vac@@ ant school children .
it is allowed to collect especially vulner@@ able an@@ cho@@ ke .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here , with global weather conditions , we would find out how all this is in practice .
how does that actually work ?
so we sent a conce@@ aled investigations into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as afri@@ can minister , who wanted to bring out the susp@@ ect money into the USA to buy a yacht , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that all up to a lawyer made our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ fixes . none of these lawyers participated in the client as a client , and of course anyone has been handed over to the money . yet it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider that not as individual cases .
it is not possible to spread a single An@@ w@@ alt , who presented our conce@@ aled investigations .
it is not about a single top polish , wrapped in a sc@@ and@@ al .
this is how the system works , by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to handle this , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
it &apos;s all very common sense when we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing would have changed it ; as if there is always the rich and mighty .
but as a bor@@ row@@ ful optimization I really see that a lot has begun to change .
in the last few years we have seen pre@@ ferences to more transparency what concerns the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then the EU has been involved in central stops at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts that the US is back here .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both legislative chambers , but this makes not the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama dis@@ closures , this huge insight into the world of tax phases , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the USA and globally .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
we need managers in the economy , who stand up and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and end to end through the laws of this type of transparent .
together , we can finally termin@@ ate the in@@ transparent , which now has this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story how I ab@@ duc@@ ted almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das had to be landed .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a rear @-@ selling .
a type in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city alone and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to peace scor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the error to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
and I thought : Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleep now ?
but I just knew him just ! he says that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to get in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Go , how to please ? &quot;
in the night I was in bed , I star@@ red on the ceiling , and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I mounted to me ?
a wild living in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got a fear that I went out of the bed to the door of a door , and my sleep door closed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he bought from me depends on today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
that was my first experience as hosts . it completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger , are actually friends who were only waiting for them to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap forward , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my roomm@@ ates and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
I believe , creativity can make it to transform anxi@@ ety in fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new co @-@ inhabitants Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I wrote something to deser@@ ve something . our apartment will stay on a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded such as &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on a wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure to decorate our Che@@ ese ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we caught our last guest and the door fell into the castle , then Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends and rent our rent at the same time ?
the things came into rolls .
my former co @-@ inhabitants , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ c@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to figure out if you could make a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly posts pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are coming when visiting .
over the Internet you can invite you to stay with them to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the miss@@ ile would be kindled .
but she did not .
no one who is still in comfort would be investing in a business that allowed the stranger to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned as children all , strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can see the things that can be good . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall survival .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create by design immense confidence , among people who never had previously met .
can design work like something ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a sample , whose degree trust we trusted .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will be out of your com@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I &apos;d like to lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock cell phone your left seat .
this quiet spot of pan@@ ic , which you can feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts , if they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing , which is more personal than your mobile , your home is home .
visitors can not just read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ lock cell of a stranger in their hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
they also feel the most guests when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
so , who now has Al Go@@ res Mobile ?
could you communicate on Twitter that he di@@ pped for the Office of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a small detail at this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor could only be presented with his name ; if he tells us how he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments which all say : &quot; he really can hold fast mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would like to give your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ kept feedback system , confidence is crucial .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult to give negative voters .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest their findings were submitted , before we introduced them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we performed with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are at age and residence .
little sur@@ pris@@ ingly , we trust the people most , which are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less trust we .
this is a natural social Vo@@ re@@ ingen@@ dness .
more exciting , if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three substances , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changed .
a good reputation of the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deep roots .
in addition , we drove out that trust is depending on how much you can .
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
if you get too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tells about how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , there is an optimal degree of open@@ ness , such as &quot; T@@ olle art works in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree in open@@ ness ?
we use the size of the text to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics should be writing something .
our whole company builds upon the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prec@@ urs@@ ors opposite the fore@@ igner .
with which we had not counted , the great quantity of people who were more than willing to pick this preliminary parts .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbelievable good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a demand that was not covered before .
for us the business is just very good .
of course there are times , if not all smoothly running .
there were guests who celebrated un@@ permitted parties and apartments have been devast@@ ated .
hosts have guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I took part in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . I &apos;m sorry when I think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that list@@ ens to the voice of the call@@ ers , and will always be our largest motivation to improve us .
fortunately , only one fra@@ ction has had a problem of 123 million displac@@ ed nights .
for people trusted in each other .
when confidence works , won@@ dro@@ us works can be created .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay and he suffered a heart attack there .
his host was put into hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his app@@ ra@@ isal :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real f@@ ails that save one life , although they don &apos;t know any right .
driving one in your own car , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books .
you can stay even longer , no longer charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , of course , not every stay .
but this relationships behind the pure ATM transaction are exactly what you want to reach with Share Economy .
when I was on this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of the part coinci@@ de with banknotes ?
it &apos;s a economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but just to call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will not just be justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
but what would be a rich buffet from local income ?
what would be , if at any place you have visited , a group there would wait to wait for a thoroughly filling and one with a p@@ ubs area , of which one has never heard ;
or if you cook about a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to divide the apartments of the reason ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have thought about common share ?
I present me cities , which allow company and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and depreciation .
in South Korea of Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
now residents were offered . students who were looking for a stay in search of a stay ,
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were completed . incub@@ ators have been started .
to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy , more than our platform alone will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries to guest with a stranger or even host .
the idea seems so not so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we didn &apos;t invented the wheel .
hospitality has also been there before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did our work right now ?
apart from luck and tim@@ ing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of the confi@@ denti@@ ality .
design can help us overcome deep roots .
I find it bl@@ oss@@ oms ,
to overwhel@@ m@@ ingly overwhelming .
I have to think about it , when a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
we naturally know that design cannot be solved any problem .
but when it could help us , if it had been this great influence , I wonder what we can make design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a faithful ? a expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain under@@ wear , a terrorist act ?
or simply a delay on the airport at the airport .
this is true .
I don &apos;t give you the bl@@ ame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent such as I look like .
a study revealed that 80 % of coverage above Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans , most of them do not know Muslims .
probably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never learned a Muslim : it is great , you know .
I say to you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ friendly -- double Esp@@ res@@ so , with cream extra .
I am toler@@ ated ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ ower @-@ Fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ age ,
and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim min .
but not how Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do it .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to get me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends , but as the Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
my fem@@ inist friendship were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you op@@ t yourself ? &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ ige was : at that time it was a fem@@ inist of independence of independence , although I felt like 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to fit myself a perfect and distinctive beauty ideal .
I have not only passive the faith of my parents .
I have with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought after , exhibited in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dev@@ otion that deep@@ ened himself with every reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of rhyth@@ mi@@ k bring me sometimes a weeping .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone makes you perceive , you totally under@@ stands , and that somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and started like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineer .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ een . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes in building , people sp@@ ills from the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should one do something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched the TV channel and heard it ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ hadi@@ st ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my land attacked , but in the n@@ u turned me the works of others from a citizen to a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to go through the Middle East in the USA to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate course .
I remember that when we were silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went in my seat , and I was the first time feared as the Muslim time .
we moved into our apartment in this night , in a new town , in which it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead in well lit places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims were gathered to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings of the feelings of understanding and I heard of attacks on Muslims , or by people , which they stayed for Muslims in the Free and killed .
there were really Bran@@ dan@@ ces on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because people who had attacked this land , have attacked our land .
I have changed the rage of the people to the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
today we can hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to close Muslims and Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US .
it &apos;s only the question : are we b@@ ös@@ ar@@ tig or ben@@ ered ?
they know : a mal@@ icious tumor was removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign cancer only under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are inventor and teachers , Er@@ s@@ thel@@ ial and Olympic Ris@@ ks .
will the closing of Mos@@ ques America be saf@@ er ?
there will be a few parking lots , but not stop the terror .
regular visit to a mosque will be able to consider people of other faith toler@@ ant , and larger citizens participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington &apos;s area , DC recently told : people are not al@@ igned with mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ alized in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
when radi@@ al@@ izing process it has been found that he will begin online . as the result of his family , the extre@@ mes of your church can do that the person believes that the person believes the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and their ide@@ ology , is a betra@@ yers or by faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ ization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group establishes its brood with the cor@@ an as the IS .
as a Muslim , as a human being , I think we have to do everything to stop a group as the IS .
but we would have told us into its suburbs , when one recogni@@ zes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you cast a look on it , she does not drives what they are in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their ne@@ sting , which they can read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me a amazing story :
a girl came to him , because they were adher@@ ed to join the IS .
I was surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the contrary . everyone who had spoken , she brought her to silence , and told her that her wrath was for iniquity in the world , that would only be in trouble .
of nothing , inspired and something that was given to their rage , she was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization by extrem@@ ists that their solution told her .
this be@@ am introduced the connection to God and their community .
instead of acc@@ use for their rage , he showed her constru@@ ctive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept it to join the IS .
that was an insight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and my family affects .
but how does it work for normal Americans ?
how does it work on any other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear appear on our democracy every day , on our idea ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies -- show : when we fear , at least three things happen .
we also accept a author@@ itarian system of government , conformity and pre@@ parts .
one study shows : if you submit Test@@ ed News in which negative about Muslims were reported , they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look , when the mood against Muslims follow up - between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run of Iraq war and during two elec@@ toral periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to manip@@ ulate the public to get to the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we perhaps feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear fell to us all .
if the assignment of collective debt does not only go to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both came to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , most generous man , whom they knew .
she visited him there , and showed her life . she was hop@@ ed and said :
&quot; when is it become a young man from my breasts such a young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne near her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , her murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon , as with a execution , after he had post@@ war crimes against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be un@@ mor@@ ally , but also dead@@ ly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or we stayed safe at home ?
we had it and for us it was not a slight decision , because we want to let us transfer our children , one that would control us through fear , or one of whom we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided to be the mosque .
with our son in the kinder@@ garten , we were silent , with high pressure at the Mos@@ que .
I took him out , and went out of my foot@@ wear , and went into the building of prayer , and what I saw that I kept myself .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the Im@@ am made a announcement , than@@ ked and called our guests , because the half of the were gathered Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ eist@@ s , believers , and non @-@ cred@@ itors who have come to attack us , but for us .
at that moment I joined together .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion for compassion and disc@@ ern .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism at the moment ?
will you go on number safe ?
or are you to connect to them that are : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you very nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : thus D@@ alia , you seem to have a nerv@@ ous .
but I wonder what do you say that you may say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a memorial with a dr@@ ink@@ age are working , so that one exception and not usually are the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t know . I am entirely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at the Muslims in the world , and I did that with the biggest ever carried out study on Muslims in all over the world , people want to normal human things .
they want prosper@@ ity for the family , they want to live work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any way .
if people appear as a rule , then the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for bast@@ ards , it stands for a short time before .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air pollution in our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France live a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks in France . some years ago it began to fly with arrows .
through connecting , flight machines reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ resistant structures .
they have learned to bear loads with tur@@ bul@@ ence and to react to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of possible flight to autonomous flight .
in order to have a system aut@@ on@@ om , it has to know collective con@@ cre@@ ations , where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic application .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alis@@ ing technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , calculations on board which should do the machine .
external commands are at the highest g@@ e. g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
one flight device that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
like other starters , it is efficient and efficient more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most of the Star@@ r@@ whis@@ k , it is floating , and so great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a mit@@ er side .
a limitation of rear star@@ tering is that they respond to tur@@ bul@@ ence like wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter what is the optimal position , and the performance can be improved by practice .
al@@ right .
during our research we often provide basic abstract questions , which approach to the core of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts , who are joined to viol@@ ate you .
more than decades ago , pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying devices that had only two moving parts : one propeller and a rear wheel .
but we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically sim@@ pl@@ est control device . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a propeller ,
no cl@@ aws , hing@@ es and lateral ru@@ dder , no further expansion or control surfaces , only a propeller .
although it is mechanically simple , it happens in the inner life very much , so that it can fly stable and move in space .
nevertheless it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the rear end . to fly to flying , I must cast it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it exactly if all is shown , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in pleas@@ ant@@ ness , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with his eight prop@@ ell@@ ers , an exercise in excess .
what to do with all this flow ?
they see that he is not balanced .
that is why he is equivalent to its orientation .
thereby he receives the greatest ability to deliver
to move in space in all directions , no matter what it is turned direction or even as he rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is available in models , the rest will learn to fly directly at the fly .
we look at that .
if flying machines must be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely reliable and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ ellers machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise .
when you build it , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls , the electronics or a battery - can fly further if limited .
we will demonstrate this now by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a pallet on aesthetic expression .
we included commerci@@ ally available micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weights less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alis@@ ing technology and algorith@@ ms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine , I would like to display a flying lamp screen at Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us is the reward in the development and work act .
it serves as a memory of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it is creative , wise creature , allowing them to form a spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the bac@@ on is on the i .
thank you very much .
at 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far distant galax@@ y , two black holes are always qu@@ icker , they turned into pure energy at a tenth time in pure energy .
these short moment they ligh@@ tened more than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very large dum@@ b .
but they put their energy in the form of light -
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time poultry himself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
at 1.3 billion years ago , several zel@@ li@@ ges was created on earth .
since then the earth has brought forth some : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God will rise up -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ age@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss came from the MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of the C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ations of black holes .
most held them for mad .
but enough people saw them as a mad gene , so that the US National Science Foundation was to finance their idea .
after decades , design , design , conception and extremely much har@@ der work , they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ ometer Gra@@ vit@@ ational Observatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could significantly increase the detection performance enorm@@ ously improved .
therefore it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
early September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run by some smaller , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ que@@ ens cut through the earth through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector through .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the goo@@ db@@ ye of my father @-@ sick Father .
basically , that was the fruits of my living .
all this , what I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . he has been resear@@ ching gra@@ vit@@ ational therap@@ ist for 23 years and its serv@@ icing signals such as L@@ IG@@ O measuring signals . but what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is an angle of forces in the encoder of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and into the other .
for illustr@@ ative theory of lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses of rel@@ ativity on theory , often have a really al@@ ber@@ ed dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , are ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us stretched to the waves of the waves and stopped . el@@ ong@@ ation of an average people was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means that 20 zer@@ os after the compass , followed by a 1st , one explained the L@@ IG@@ O staff for crazy .
with a five kilometer laser detector , and this is already ab@@ sur@@ d , it would have to be exactly measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of the radius of a nuclear @-@ core . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt after the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties for the construction of such detectors are mighty .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are fin@@ alist and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott tells us , L@@ IG@@ O be more an ear than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things around us : fac@@ ial lifts , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical . because so you can produce a picture or a map of things by using several points coming to you .
with pots , this is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you very much :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties such as clay and level , rhythm and volume to close to the story behind .
&quot; now Alice is talking about Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob dis@@ breaks them . &quot;
&quot; the number of Bob . &quot;
the same applies to Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t produce any simple images of objects in all .
however , having regard to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for L@@ IG@@ O the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can listen to all literally .
the gravity to listen , can give us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes which my colleague Scott has already been busy very long .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , Cir@@ pen simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ cl@@ ones with an additional clay exchange . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a type of motion password , shaped into the shaft shape .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date , which at least I never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des Ger@@ sh@@ ch &#93; J@@ IG@@ O said : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des Ger@@ sh@@ ch &#93; , knows this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 times the sun weight , which are about as fast as the bars of your mixer .
AA : let us think about what this means .
two black holes , the dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 balls , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , each revol@@ ve one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this is the lasting significance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O is a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to the All and the invisible .
so , in all , we can not see -- practically or basically -- .
a super nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ tive stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot of things .
the exciting physical events are done in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts penet@@ rating iron , as it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ cr@@ ine : I would explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the judgments are covered by his own fl@@ ashing .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and probably the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen that we will never see , and of which we don &apos;t have any presentation . things we can only discover how we hear .
in fact L@@ IG@@ O found the first point of things that we had not expected .
my colleague at the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project says to this topic : ME : the type of stars that produce black holes like L@@ IG@@ O they are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so called the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ raut for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O enables us to see a completely different viewing angle in All , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately it as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now in it , as must be as possible only .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to builds great detectors and the noise of the cos@@ mos of cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ serv@@ atories - a completely new generation of ob@@ servatory on earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than the ur@@ ine ?
now the time is great dreams .
dreams to us with us .
thank you .
some time I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year long I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of whom I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it was nerv@@ ous , brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced to tell me &quot; Yes . &quot;
wanted I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted to start playing with the play ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , I bes@@ ought my fears .
my fears to keep spe@@ ech@@ es , my social anxi@@ ety -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life , an unexpected art . it started with a question of my little ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all . &quot;
when would she be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ sa@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked for me if I could play with her , when I was straight on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I will swear by myself , as soon as you &apos;ll swear . no matter what I just doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- each single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect but I &apos;m getting quick .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effects : just before short , I actually understood that &quot; Yes &quot; S@@ ages to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think you made me , sn@@ ap up for life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I creative TV . I producer television .
I make television , in big style .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for the world to add 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are at the same time .
every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new episode of nine days of four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three ship@@ ments , the same time in production , four episodes : Sc@@ and@@ al , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With one , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
my TV series will start on Thursday night in America .
in the whole world , my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created itself , and not only produced , thus even ob@@ end@@ ous . I have time to find really silent , creative time to gather my fans at my fans and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who this is still doing ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
I say it because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you all of you who are so hard work if you &apos;re now a company , a country or a class@@ room that you can understand that I &apos;m not only on the computer , and fant@@ as@@ ers , and it &apos;s true if I say , I understand that it is not in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all the blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work too much , hard and I love it .
if I am deep@@ ened to work , there is no other feeling .
my job always creates a country out of nothing .
it is , when I turned up to a canvas , when I was painted on a screen .
so he dre@@ amt a high sound , lie@@ fs a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , persistent and de@@ pri@@ ved , funny and mut@@ ually , clin@@ ically , cruel , fierce and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me when doing this work well .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s hears like a busy street , I could always go to it for ever .
many people take a lot if I speak to them the sum@@ s that I write it , that this writing is joy for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- as I started to work with TV production , when I began to work and to work , to create and assemble , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have so sum@@ s up , then you can not reach differently than in size .
the feeling that cannot be different than to the size , no matter , at which price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it means to be a workplace .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is afraid of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to say you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it in question .
to make a clear : the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more Things are , the more things the same time , the more the more I write me , the more the more I write their history , the more the more expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more has to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I create the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then stopped the sum@@ s .
revised , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ om is a single working Institute .
Har@@ per tells you : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ titanium .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I loved my work no more . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not go back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous weekends , no Reu@@ e , not deleg@@ ate , a titanium is not allowed , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever always .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me it was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was I .
so what do you do if what you do , the work that you love , suddenly I hated ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some are thinking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ l you out , stup@@ id the author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do , one man works , one loves to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you just loves one another and that gives the sum@@ s if you knew the sum@@ s even if the sum@@ s stopped , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
do I still have a titanium ?
when the song of my heart hears , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South @-@ States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; puts me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to outside , late for it and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I have already said to tell me when two things are aware of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say Yes to everything and second , she called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is that happen ?
I miss it , if I am Titan , and my sum@@ s pray , and here all changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and their sisters together , we laugh too much and I read more dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in sol@@ itude and lack of the sum@@ s , can I do anything except to fit .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I create the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they do not exist anymore .
everything that exists , st@@ icky fingers and hum@@ id k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , wax pins , and song , in which it is sl@@ ack , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; leaves .
everywhere is peace and simp@@ licity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ las .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
an ment@@ ary door goes up and an energy club comes in .
and that is not immediately , it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let us remain with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we forgot .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium dioxide , that &apos;s only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I say to you who I am , if I get me with the help of ship@@ ments and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not working specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river that comes from the pleasure of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which to carry out tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps he whis@@ per@@ ed to me God the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I &apos;m doing this firm , so that I am free as a workshop of any fault .
it is the law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games , I like it .
if you do not play for me as we work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace as home .
this is painful , because what a man works rather than to be a house ?
well , I , I .
hon@@ est , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too late , one is one of them .
we turn around in the garden , before and back , go back and run .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ushed silk bub@@ bles .
in this process , I feel much sti@@ ff@@ ness , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always run according to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how you live , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever heard with the games ?
you can also do it ! say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you can hold me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day dre@@ aming .
there is well , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes , until they s@@ words that they want to make something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Marien@@ kä@@ fer or K@@ eks was replaced .
and speak my Teen@@ ie daughter all 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more need it not .
each can bring 15 minutes a piece , even in a bad La@@ une Day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no steering .
the day is short : dinner , the children are drunk .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ ills !
my children are my bene@@ factors , my world . it &apos;s not to be the children . it is valid to feel the sum@@ s to feel a place for his soul fri@@ gh@@ old .
it &apos;s not about playing with our own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
get the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I guess and I won . friends meet , books read , enjoying the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything that I gave my first TV show , when I got a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass over myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why do not get full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my leisure time . the sum@@ s seems to return soon if I don &apos;t work .
works not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months will open a door , the energy flow in and I find me back in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it satis@@ fies me and my soul . you guide me again . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s but I love it not .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s isn &apos;t I ... no more .
bub@@ bles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just another part . and therefore I am so than@@ k@@ ful .
it is me that I am a Titan bin . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my storage fire is still working .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like good mother .
the more I play , the more clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land , which I run , the marathon , I run , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new feeling of life in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think you made me , I ar@@ ous@@ ed you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; too much work and more games .
Titan@@ s have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very nice .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human beings .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geon it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other physi@@ c@@ ures , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nerv@@ ous system , the patients often have a constant , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgery ?
a doctor , trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
surely , they have heard from one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stim@@ ulation . &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is really an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , who suffered severe cit@@ ers and heavy pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leader , and worked in the not@@ e@@ ation day and night .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that at skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a brain the brain is arbitr@@ arily inclined and the cran@@ ial pressure is inclined .
to save life , you have to reduce the skull pressure .
it is necessary to remove a s@@ wollen brain mass by sometimes .
instead of s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , to analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
cells of a tissues , similar to quite small children who will be taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and environments to grow to it .
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it succeeded Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
maybe you can still know from the biograph@@ ies that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small denom@@ inations .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they were slowly and after a few weeks , they died even .
so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell population , which looked like stem cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand from where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they arise 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ral cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the F@@ öt@@ us , she car@@ es for the folding of the brain .
but why do they continue to get us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injury .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ language section and then cultiv@@ ate the cells accurately as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then , to mark it , to track them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the examination of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in dig@@ ging brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that it had been completely disappeared after a few weeks , they would have been taken back home . the room is already occupied there , they will not be used there , so they van@@ ish them .
in the second scenario , we got an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- it grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence showing them are these small points . these are the cells that we t@@ ained in vitro , in the culture .
we couldn &apos;t stop here .
help these cells also a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity job .
they had to take the pellets of a tablet .
they made it very good .
when they had reached a stable dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we had the motor motor@@ ized motor in the motor Cort@@ ex .
as a result , the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontan@@ e@@ ously to a certain degree , exactly as after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover from plastic brain mechanisms . they recover a certain degree , just like the apes .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontan@@ eous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand they see the monkey , recovered spontan@@ e@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we im@@ planted the cells as we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the im@@ plantation .
I can say you , that were also very exciting results .
since that time , we have found much more about these cells .
we can use them freeze and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson &apos;s Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them with people .
I really hope that I may show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal himself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that is wonderful , I &apos;m sure to think several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely definitely .
of course , the question of what the greatest obstacles are , before you can start clinical studies on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the largest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to complete this type of studies .
BG : that &apos;s under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ ate etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical studies . if you see further into the future , how many years it takes it to come into hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial .
will it allow us to allow us to start it soon ?
then one must perform this study with a small group of patients .
it has already been a long time to choose the patient to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this type of treatment .
after that , one must apply this to a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study .
it must first be re@@ prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment each .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
in the West we make a great mistake to view it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant , which is in reality , but as the inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as an unexpected gradient .
we believe that capitalism force in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big Nach@@ ah@@ mer in Peking have doubt doubt that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains un@@ democr@@ atically un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe .
in the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ am@@ big@@ uous declared that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not influence the au@@ ster@@ ity programs that were realised in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my raised friends who would be repeated that democracy would change anything , when it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I bese@@ ech you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a real and def@@ ective democracy .
for without democracy our societies are brick , our future dark and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted away .
on the subject of waste I would like to point to an interesting contra@@ diction which currently threat@@ ens our taver@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . they know and acknow@@ ledge him as the debt of the debt , which raises its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but only a few know his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is one of un@@ used savings and corpor@@ ations that could be investing there , where it would be productive and income , with which one could produce debt and also all the things that humanity ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the US , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the wealth of goods , such as industrial plant , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollars , after a lot of money , you compare it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that remained at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , apart from the stock markets and the real estate prices .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which did not compens@@ ate through the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which could not invest in which they do not invest . exactly as Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who could not invest in which they could kill him , that his son would kill him if he will grow .
in@@ rolled the circumstances that leads to that oil would kill him .
that is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
its extremely toxic capital should be deployed to improve our lives , developing human talents and particularly to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
so democracy is the solution ?
I think so . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as a party form , in which the open and poor as a majority control the government .
the ath@@ en@@ ish democracy were of course too many of --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , there would be an error , the wave value of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy in due to in@@ clusions .
the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that they gave the working poor and not only the right to free expression , but more important and crucial , which they had the right to political co @-@ determination with equal vote in questions of the government .
although the ath@@ en@@ ish democracy had not kept long --
like a candle that illumin@@ ates very light , it is also fast as fast .
however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in the ancient Athen ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens , the liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for ruling .
for the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was reduced to politics during the economy -- the world of the corpor@@ ations -- a demo@@ cra@@ y@@ free zone .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time , at which the separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ her@@ ed@@ itary struggle between the two , the economy slowly moves politics and wander@@ ed them .
don &apos;t you wonder why the politicians are not so much more like earlier ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is possible that one can be able today in the government and still not in power because the power of politics in the economy are removed and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of smo@@ kers , lasting so su@@ stain@@ ably the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they were hungry at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy , which is so far @-@ caused by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself , the power of the corpor@@ ations grows , political goods increases , the overall economic demand , and the management of the corpor@@ ations are supp@@ ressed , to invest the cash of their company .
according to the successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher are the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human power and prosper@@ ity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; control reserves , as in the ancient Athen , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had this idea about 100 years ago and it did not van@@ ish them .
the doctrine from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is only recur@@ ring a position as in the ancient Athen , without creating new species of brood and waste .
but there is a solution : do the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wages by automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin @-@ rise higher , the waste coverage , and the social conflicts down deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we must move the economy and un@@ ite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we have democr@@ atically democr@@ atically democr@@ atically democr@@ atically @-@ related area , otherwise we are able to appear in a disease called &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
so the question is not whether the technical achievements , which he has brought forth , will survive --
the interesting question is whether the capitalism is replaced by a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to mankind &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve the people and put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long talks with the sense of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; star Trek &quot; like the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
in the practical implementation I would like to call you shortly , some examples .
in the company : please make a capital market before you have earned and in which your capital is deser@@ ved from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one has just works -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and income , and the concept of wage labour is completely overhau@@ led .
there is no distinction between those who work the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees working there , but the company does not include . no di@@ ver between capital and work , no big g@@ aps between investments and pairs , and ultimately didn &apos;t lift up the twin summit .
in the field of global political economy : please tell us that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ate exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest thresh@@ olds &#93; , in the interest of all mankind .
imagine that the whole world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency -- as we call them &quot; Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government paying the sum of the country &apos;s trade deficit or the trade transfer of the country to a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that we had not had the technical resources at that time .
today we have made it , especially in the background of a restored politics and economy .
the world , which I cast you , is at the same time liberal , in which they preferred privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ istic , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the rub@@ b@@ ish of the history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
become awak@@ ening in such a world
or will we fall into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
the answer depends on how we decide to have polit@@ ically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you are circumcised in your biography about the liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos; Analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I had just said , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do not work that technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand , known as Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
by the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next , as we are currently living , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ize our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you think not enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said that . BG : in your presentation you have already mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner you have very clear what you have seen from the sight of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracy we have the ticket of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to the policy , during the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- a totally demo@@ cra@@ e@@ Free Zone .
in certain regard , if I may say that so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- We tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tic , concerned the democratic development .
what you can watch in China very similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
China now to take to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells massive to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curious to your experiences as the Minister of Hell@@ as in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say goo@@ db@@ ye to the self @-@ payment period , and which den@@ ies that a massive displacement line through the Eurozone went and continues to be threat@@ ening the development of the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity to open the first proposal on the basis of the Greek prec@@ urs@@ day -- the first proposal that denied this den@@ ial --
it &apos;s right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , continued to den@@ ying it .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to receive an economic system that is non @-@ vi@@ able , by political will and authorization to life , you may not hesitate any time , but if the change occurred , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have any future if we do not change their structure .
BG : have you made any mist@@ akes in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- harvest ...
if there is a Minister for Finance , or any Minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ stressed situation , he claims not any error , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mist@@ akes .
the greatest mistake had to submit the application for the extension of the training program at the end of February .
I believed that there was a hon@@ our@@ able interest in pages of the banknotes to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they had only wanted to fall our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with temp@@ tations which ran through the eu@@ ro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to stand that she was a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika of the Banknote , which insi@@ sted to us this policy : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be able to be right per @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolute .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone compared to someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest anxi@@ ety is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the em@@ bran@@ ded fli@@ ckers will be D@@ ä@@ mon@@ ish and destroy the European Union .
this will not be cat@@ astroph@@ ic for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we propose to enter the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , then it appears to be also subsequently committed to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope very that you lie wrong at this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you for you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price most of Roy has never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entert@@ aining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that met Roy before three years ago .
Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fighting sector .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any way .
he has to find shows which are very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are right on this turn right .
this curve is the evaluation division of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB Website . the rating is showing from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are preserved .
if your show is rated by nine and above , this will be a winner .
then one has a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that one has seen a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
on the left hand side , here on this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough , what is the end of the curve .
Roy Price does not respond to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ go &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean extin@@ ction , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are in@@ spire .
so he must ensure that it really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so much , therefore I will not ris@@ ky nothing .
he wants to create successes .
it needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a contest .
he occupies many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows it online where they can watch one for free .
and if Amazon is free things out , you &apos;re going to work correctly ?
millions of spectators look at this episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed when watching this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team to capture everything .
when you capture the show , when you start p@@ aus@@ ed , what parts you ski@@ p and look at once again .
you collect millions of data to choose which show you should produce them .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and it yields the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ Com over four Republi@@ can US trans@@ formers . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of them can remember this show , because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7,4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- i.e. slightly above average , but not just what are Roy and his team worked .
about the same time in another company , another manager has placed a top @-@ show due to data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , it is always on the search to find this a super show and it is also used , but it does something different .
instead of a contest , he and his team looked forward to the existing data over the Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , so the ratings they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators : what shows they like producers , what actors .
when they had together all the parts , they went into a venture and decided to do not a Sit@@ Com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series over a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this turn . so exactly there where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data versi@@ fied companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is this ?
because logic indicates that it should work at all .
if you collect millions of data for a decision to meet you , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it optimized by very powerful computer .
the least what you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analysis is not working , this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time , in which we have more and more to statistics in order to meet serious decisions , far beyond the TV .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in contact with this software in contact with this software . come in contact with this software .
if any one ask here in the US in prison , and in order to ask , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medium TV , 22 minutes , this can be real bad , but still more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not possible that a company does not know how multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data versi@@ fied companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google makes mist@@ akes sometimes .
in 2009 Google announced that they could say through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worst way - by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news conference . the success came in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature &quot; .
it worked fine , year by year until it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the publication of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature &quot; .
even the data versi@@ fied companies such as Amazon and Google may be understood sometimes .
despite all of these errors , data may abo@@ und in decisions of life an -- at the workplace , in case of legal de@@ composition , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ based Genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to meet serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ sem@@ inated .
do you need to solve a complex problem , do mainly do two things :
as a result , you will be able to analyse this issue in its sole parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second place you put together the single parts again to deal with a decision .
sometimes you must do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together .
and now the most important facts : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to destroy a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it all : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , even if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
they ut@@ ili@@ ze data to understand their audience better , for what they had not been able to get better . but the decision as to put all these parts , put together again and show a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , what meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this to the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they played by TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things are wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before it was data , this was the tool for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions regarding a J@@ a- or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here in this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will make it later with a technique .
so far , I have met some decisions in my life , with what I could have to hear in the ball .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace this by something much ex@@ cl@@ ing , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic body .
so perhaps the ball cl@@ ut@@ ger and kl@@ ü@@ ger and cl@@ ut@@ ger . finally , it &apos;s right to meet decisions if we want to reach something unusual at the end of the right curve .
and I sensitivity this as a very encour@@ aging message that it still has to pay attention in spite of the great amount of data , making decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks go .
because at the end it is not the data but the risks , which you are landing at the right end of the curve .
thank you very nice .
