<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he wrote spectacular, that the NSA illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service in which the CIA was literally delivered to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know what the chapters isn't pleased?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been determined against crises and called him to name its innumerable sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became the symbol of the government of the government to condemn Whistleblower and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if the media does not receive this information, and if they don't protect the identity of the mud, they will cost.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government struck in Risen, he did something that many courteens did before him: he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was so with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the trial, something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, even though it were longing for years, the requirements of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and crises to bring the statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigator, without his consent, his telephone numbers worried about,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its lending service, and even travel transactions with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the middle of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Riss.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, that is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, the Justice has more condemns more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how it can be a problem, especially because the government has a lot of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of that a Whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint, because the government always has more possibilities to draw all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the technology of the government permits to handle the rights of replicers, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can contact it from the moment in which she can contact us, rather than in the case, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that it was not written than Risen his book, and it's much more safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source code system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet's most famous, which has been developed by us in the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been developed further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail to send you on a News website, as the Washington Post is here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents, as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and saved on a server, which only has the relevant News Agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer create more information, and many of the information that would request it would not be available from the previous set.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop but is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments develop new spy technologies around the world, which are all at risk.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's possible to ensure that not only technology rules such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to apply misses. it is the same important that we protect the next decade.</seg>
<seg id="39">The abnormative of abuse during the supply of soldiers white and of overcrowing hospitals. or the next environmental staff, the alarm to sewage water from Flint. or a wall-Insider, which warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to uncover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest data collection of the history was published.] [the] Panama Papers' unveil that rich and mighty] [enormous money sums in taxooses have been hidden.] this week, we asked by News about a cheque of 11 million documents in Panama's local law firm Moscowca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax phases.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we will receive an impression of what clients, banks and lawyers" "" "like Mosaics Fonseca Go and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you do that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, we actually see the emails, exchange messages, how the whole system works, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is returned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a prohibits of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad briefing companies in tax phases.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be there a lot of rich people and others giving nervous to the next release, and to the next unveil documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agency, or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems wells from you, myself, unusual people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we choose what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty in the situation are able to hide their assets under control and not all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, like secret taxoes are used by some few, their assets to hide and to swallow -- something that we discuss and reveal ourselves for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appear very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these control rooms work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always have a matter before.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company in another company, in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand, who is behind this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent American Americans, which came to this revelation in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax phases.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which this tax phases work, Moscowy has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We would have a much more cases and examples from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need to specify less information in some U.S. states, to establish a company than to get a library of library.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has to allow employees of shoulders to vacant school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is allowed to collect especially vulnerable anchoke.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here, with global weather conditions, we would find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a concealed investigations into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as african minister, who wanted to bring out the suspect money into the USA to buy a yacht, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all up to a lawyer made our investigator, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all prefixes. none of these lawyers participated in the client as a client, and of course anyone has been handed over to the money. yet it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider that not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not possible to spread a single Anwalt, who presented our concealed investigations.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top polish, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">This is how the system works, by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to handle this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">It's all very common sense when we could do nothing about it; as if nothing would have changed it; as if there is always the rich and mighty.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowful optimization I really see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen preferences to more transparency what concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has been involved in central stops at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts that the US is back here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both legislative chambers, but this makes not the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama disclosures, this huge insight into the world of tax phases, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the USA and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy, who stand up and say: "Intransparent is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and end to end through the laws of this type of transparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally terminate the intransparent, which now has this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story how I abducted almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas had to be landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a rear-selling.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city alone and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to peace scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the error to ask him," "" "Where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleep now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just knew him just! he says that he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to get in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Go, how to please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was in bed, I starred on the ceiling, and thought: "Oh man! what have I mounted to me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild living in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got a fear that I went out of the bed to the door of a door, and my sleep door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he bought from me depends on today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as hosts. it completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger, are actually friends who were only waiting for them to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap forward, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can make it to transform anxiety in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new co-inhabitants Brian Chesky: "Brian, I wrote something to deserve something. our apartment will stay on a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded such as "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to decorate our Cheese ham-Omelet completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we caught our last guest and the door fell into the castle, then Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends and rent our rent at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former co-inhabitants, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly posts pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are coming when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet you can invite you to stay with them to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would be kindled.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would be investing in a business that allowed the stranger to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children all, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can see the things that can be good. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall survival.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create by design immense confidence, among people who never had previously met.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design work like something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, whose degree trust we trusted.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will be out of your comfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to lock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock cell phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet spot of panic, which you can feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts, if they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing, which is more personal than your mobile, your home is home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not just read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlock cell of a stranger in their hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">They also feel the most guests when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">So, who now has Al Gores Mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you communicate on Twitter that he dipped for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor could only be presented with his name; if he tells us how he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 assessments which all say: "he really can hold fast mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would like to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-kept feedback system, confidence is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult to give negative voters.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest their findings were submitted, before we introduced them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We performed with Stanford a study. we examined how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are at age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, which are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social Voreingendness.</seg>
<seg id="181">More exciting, if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three substances, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changed.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we drove out that trust is depending on how much you can.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you get too little, such as "Hi!," you get no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tells about how" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is also not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So, there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle art works in your apartment! I'm doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree in openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics should be writing something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds upon the hope that the right design can help to overcome our precursors opposite the foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we had not counted, the great quantity of people who were more than willing to pick this preliminary parts.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievable good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a demand that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times, if not all smoothly running.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unpermitted parties and apartments have been devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I took part in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. I'm sorry when I think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that listens to the voice of the callers, and will always be our largest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only one fraction has had a problem of 123 million displaced nights.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted in each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, wondrous works can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay and he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was put into hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his appraisal:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real fails that save one life, although they don't know any right.</seg>
<seg id="218">Driving one in your own car, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer, no longer charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, of course, not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But this relationships behind the pure ATM transaction are exactly what you want to reach with Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I was on this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of the part coincide with banknotes?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's a economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but just to call" "" "rental industry" "" "will not just be justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, it is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would be a rich buffet from local income?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if at any place you have visited, a group there would wait to wait for a thoroughly filling and one with a pubs area, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you cook about a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to divide the apartments of the reason?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have thought about common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I present me cities, which allow company and relationships, instead of solitude and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea of Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Now residents were offered. students who were looking for a stay in search of a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were completed. incubators have been started.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in Share Economy, more than our platform alone will be 785 000 people in 191 countries to guest with a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems so not so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has also been there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work right now?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of the confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it blossoms,</seg>
<seg id="251">To overwhelmingly overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it, when a red Mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We naturally know that design cannot be solved any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But when it could help us, if it had been this great influence, I wonder what we can make design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A faithful? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain underwear, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay on the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent such as I look like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of coverage above Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans, most of them do not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never learned a Muslim: it is great, you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-friendly -- double Espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am tolerated,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtower-Fitness fanatikerage,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim min.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not how Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do it.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to get me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as the Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friendship were horrified: "why do you opt yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lustige was: at that time it was a feminist of independence of independence, although I felt like 17-year-old felt to fit myself a perfect and distinctive beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passive the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, exhibited in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened himself with every reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythmik bring me sometimes a weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone makes you perceive, you totally understands, and that somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started like all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the basically the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word "Eileen."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes in building, people spills from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I switched the TV channel and heard it..." ""... "Muslim terrorists" ""... "..." ""... "in the name of Islam..." ""... "Jihadist..." ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my land attacked, but in the nu turned me the works of others from a citizen to a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to go through the Middle East in the USA to move into a new city and start the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember that when we were silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went in my seat, and I was the first time feared as the Muslim time.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment in this night, in a new town, in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" "" "be careful," "" "Be careful," "" "lead in well lit places." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims were gathered to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings of the feelings of understanding and I heard of attacks on Muslims, or by people, which they stayed for Muslims in the Free and killed.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Brandances on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this land, have attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have changed the rage of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to close Muslims and Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">It's only the question: are we bösartig or benered?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malicious tumor was removed as a whole and a benign cancer only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teachers, Ersthelial and Olympic Risks.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of Mosques America be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will be a few parking lots, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque will be able to consider people of other faith tolerant, and larger citizens participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington's area, DC recently told: people are not aligned with mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radialized in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When radializing process it has been found that he will begin online. as the result of his family, the extremes of your church can do that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology, is a betrayers or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group establishes its brood with the coran as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a human being, I think we have to do everything to stop a group as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would have told us into its suburbs, when one recognizes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you cast a look on it, she does not drives what they are in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their nesting, which they can read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they were adhered to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the contrary. everyone who had spoken, she brought her to silence, and told her that her wrath was for iniquity in the world, that would only be in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing, inspired and something that was given to their rage, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that their solution told her.</seg>
<seg id="351">This beam introduced the connection to God and their community.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse for their rage, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, like the Islamophobia and my family affects.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work for normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear appear on our democracy every day, on our idea?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- show: when we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We also accept a authoritarian system of government, conformity and preparts.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if you submit Tested News in which negative about Muslims were reported, they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look, when the mood against Muslims follow up - between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run of Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Moslem-terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to get to the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We perhaps feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear fell to us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">If the assignment of collective debt does not only go to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both came to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweet, most generous man, whom they knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and showed her life. she was hoped and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is it become a young man from my breasts such a young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne near her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, her murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon, as with a execution, after he had postwar crimes against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be unmorally, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or we stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We had it and for us it was not a slight decision, because we want to let us transfer our children, one that would control us through fear, or one of whom we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to be the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the kindergarten, we were silent, with high pressure at the Mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and went out of my footwear, and went into the building of prayer, and what I saw that I kept myself.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made a announcement, thanked and called our guests, because the half of the were gathered Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-creditors who have come to attack us, but for us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I joined together.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion for compassion and discern.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from fear and fanaticism at the moment?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or are you to connect to them that are: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: thus Dalia, you seem to have a nervous.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say that you may say that you are a TEDTalk, a memorial with a drinkage are working, so that one exception and not usually are the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't know. I am entirely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at the Muslims in the world, and I did that with the biggest ever carried out study on Muslims in all over the world, people want to normal human things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want to live work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not an exception in any way.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as a rule, then the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for bastards, it stands for a short time before.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air pollution in our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Frac Centre in France live a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks in France. some years ago it began to fly with arrows.</seg>
<seg id="410">Through connecting, flight machines reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-resistant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads with turbulence and to react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of possible flight to autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to have a system autonom, it has to know collective concreations, where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic application.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localising technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, calculations on board which should do the machine.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are at the highest ge. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">One flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient and efficient more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the Starrwhisk, it is floating, and so great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a miter side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear startering is that they respond to turbulence like wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device doesn't matter what is the optimal position, and the performance can be improved by practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Alright.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often provide basic abstract questions, which approach to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts, who are joined to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">More than decades ago, pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying devices that had only two moving parts: one propeller and a rear wheel.</seg>
<seg id="435">But we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest control device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No claws, hinges and lateral rudder, no further expansion or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, it happens in the inner life very much, so that it can fly stable and move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of the rear end. to fly to flying, I must cast it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it exactly if all is shown, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is a exercise in pleasantness, this machine is here, the Omnihead with his eight propellers, an exercise in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not balanced.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is equivalent to its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the greatest ability to deliver</seg>
<seg id="447">To move in space in all directions, no matter what it is turned direction or even as he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is available in models, the rest will learn to fly directly at the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">We look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines must be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely reliable and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin-propellers machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build it, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls, the electronics or a battery - can fly further if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a pallet on aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We included commercially available micro-Quadcopter -- each individual weights less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with localising technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine, I would like to display a flying lamp screen at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and work act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it is creative, wise creature, allowing them to form a spectacular fashion.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the bacon is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">At 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes are always quicker, they turned into pure energy at a tenth time in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">These short moment they lightened more than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very large dumb.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they put their energy in the form of light -</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time poultry himself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">At 1.3 billion years ago, several zelliges was created on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth some: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people and -- God will rise up -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss came from the MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitations of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for mad.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people saw them as a mad gene, so that the US National Science Foundation was to finance their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades, design, design, conception and extremely much harder work, they built the detector LIGO: the laser-interferometer Gravitational Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could significantly increase the detection performance enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">Early September 2015 LIGO was launched for a last test run by some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliqueens cut through the earth through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector through.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye of my father-sick Father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, that was the fruits of my living.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he has been researching gravitational therapist for 23 years and its servicing signals such as LIGO measuring signals. but what are Gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is an angle of forces in the encoder of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative theory of lecturers in courses of relativity on theory, often have a really albered dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us stretched to the waves of the waves and stopped. elongation of an average people was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means that 20 zeros after the compass, followed by a 1st, one explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, it would have to be exactly measured in less than a thousandths of the radius of a nuclear-core. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt after the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties for the construction of such detectors are mighty.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are finalist and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott tells us, LIGO be more an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial lifts, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can produce a picture or a map of things by using several points coming to you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With pots, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties such as clay and level, rhythm and volume to close to the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice is talking about Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob disbreaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"the number of Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't produce any simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">However, having regard to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern in sound, we can listen to all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen, can give us a lot about the collision of two black holes which my colleague Scott has already been busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, Cirpen simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very quickly, you hear the same circlones with an additional clay exchange. this sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of motion password, shaped into the shaft shape.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date, which at least I never forget -- heard LIGO the following: [Surrendes Gershch] JIGO said: [Surrendes Gershch], knows this as a noise of -- SH:... two black holes with 30 times the sun weight, which are about as fast as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 balls, the other with a mass of 36 suns, each revolve one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the lasting significance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">So, in all, we can not see -- practically or basically --.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super nova, for example. I would like to know why massertive stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical events are done in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational shafts penetrating iron, as it would be transparent glass. the Urcrine: I would explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the judgments are covered by his own flashing.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen that we will never see, and of which we don't have any presentation. things we can only discover how we hear.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO found the first point of things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at the MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project says to this topic: ME: the type of stars that produce black holes like LIGO they are the dinosaurs of the universe</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so called the Saurierkraut for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO enables us to see a completely different viewing angle in All, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately it as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now in it, as must be as possible only.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to builds great detectors and the noise of the cosmos of cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a completely new generation of observatory on earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams to us with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year long I would say to all" Yes! "" "" I was afraid of whom I feared. "" "</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it was nervous, brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced to tell me "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start playing with the play?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared, I besought my fears.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fears to keep speeches, my social anxiety -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, which changed my life, an unexpected art. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all. "</seg>
<seg id="570">When would she be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "I need milk for my beak-saasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked for me if I could play with her, when I was straight on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I will swear by myself, as soon as you'll swear. no matter what I just doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- each single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect but I'm getting quick.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effects: just before short, I actually understood that "Yes" Sages to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think you made me, snap up for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I creative TV. I producer television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for the world to add 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode of nine days of four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shipments, the same time in production, four episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With one, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">My TV series will start on Thursday night in America.</seg>
<seg id="594">In the whole world, my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created itself, and not only produced, thus even obendous. I have time to find really silent, creative time to gather my fans at my fans and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who this is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you who are so hard work if you're now a company, a country or a classroom that you can understand that I'm not only on the computer, and fantasers, and it's true if I say, I understand that it is not in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all the blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work too much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">If I am deepened to work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My job always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I turned up to a canvas, when I was painted on a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">So he dreamt a high sound, liefs a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, persistent and deprived, funny and mutually, clinically, cruel, fierce and reasonable. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when doing this work well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums hears like a busy street, I could always go to it for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take a lot if I speak to them the sums that I write it, that this writing is joy for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- as I started to work with TV production, when I began to work and to work, to create and assemble, I discovered this thing, this sums. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have so sums up, then you can not reach differently than in size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that cannot be different than to the size, no matter, at which price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means to be a workplace.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is afraid of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for failure, and I know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to say you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more Things are, the more things the same time, the more the more I write me, the more the more I write their history, the more the more expectations.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more has to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I create the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stopped the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, exaggerated, exagated, exagated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single working Institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells you: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "I would like to go to Shonda Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not go back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, continuous weekends, no Reue, not delegate, a titanium is not allowed, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever always.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me it was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work that you love, suddenly I hated?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some are thinking:" "" "Hayl you out, stupid the author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, one man works, one loves to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, you just loves one another and that gives the sums if you knew the sums even if the sums stopped, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Do I still have a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart hears, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "South-States waitress" "" "puts me a question." ""</seg>

<seg id="676">When is that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it, if I am Titan, and my sums pray, and here all changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters together, we laugh too much and I read more dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in solitude and lack of the sums, can I do anything except to fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they do not exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists, sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax pins, and song, in which it is slack, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" leaves.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atlas.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I'm happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">An mentary door goes up and an energy club comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium dioxide, that's only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I say to you who I am, if I get me with the help of shipments and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not working specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river that comes from the pleasure of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of history, which to carry out tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps he whispered to me God the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I'm doing this firm, so that I am free as a workshop of any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is the law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in games, I like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">If you do not play for me as we work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This is painful, because what a man works rather than to be a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too late, one is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We turn around in the garden, before and back, go back and run.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crushed silk bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In this process, I feel much stiffness, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always run according to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how you live, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we ever heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you can hold me for naiv, for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">There is well, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes, until they swords that they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or Keks was replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my Teenie daughter all 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more need it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can bring 15 minutes a piece, even in a bad Laune Day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no steering.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are drunk.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drills!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my benefactors, my world. it's not to be the children. it is valid to feel the sums to feel a place for his soul frighold.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with our own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Get the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I guess and I won. friends meet, books read, enjoying the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "stands for everything that I gave my first TV show, when I got a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass over myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why do not get full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my leisure time. the sums seems to return soon if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months will open a door, the energy flow in and I find me back in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it satisfies me and my soul. you guide me again. I use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums but I love it not.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums isn't I... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just another part. and therefore I am so thankful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me that I am a Titan bin. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my storage fire is still working.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land, which I run, the marathon, I run, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums of life: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, beating, naked and new feeling of life in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think you made me, I aroused you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" too much work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human beings.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other physicures, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, the patients often have a constant, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgery?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely, they have heard from one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." it implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, who suffered severe citers and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leader, and worked in the noteation day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You need to imagine that at skull-brain traumata brain the brain is arbitrarily inclined and the cranial pressure is inclined.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">It is necessary to remove a swollen brain mass by sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissues, similar to quite small children who will be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and environments to grow to it.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it succeeded Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you can still know from the biographies that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small denominations.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks, they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, weird cell population, which looked like stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand from where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They arise 4% of our cerebral cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the Fötus, she cares for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they continue to get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-language section and then cultivate the cells accurately as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then, to mark it, to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the examination of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in digging brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that it had been completely disappeared after a few weeks, they would have been taken back home. the room is already occupied there, they will not be used there, so they vanish them.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we got an injury to and reimplanted the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- it grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence showing them are these small points. these are the cells that we tained in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity job.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take the pellets of a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable dexterity level, we had the motor motorized motor in the motor Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, exactly as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover from plastic brain mechanisms. they recover a certain degree, just like the apes.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand they see the monkey, recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we implanted the cells as we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can say you, that were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them freeze and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson's Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them with people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I may show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that is wonderful, I'm sure to think several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what the greatest obstacles are, before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the largest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to complete this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical studies. if you see further into the future, how many years it takes it to come into hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then one must perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It has already been a long time to choose the patient to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, one must apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">It must first be reprove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment each.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West we make a great mistake to view it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an unexpected gradient.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism force inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big Nachahmer in Peking have doubt doubt that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains undemocratically undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy disappears with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">In the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous declared that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not influence the austerity programs that were realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my raised friends who would be repeated that democracy would change anything, when it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I beseech you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a real and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are brick, our future dark and our great, new technologies are wasted away.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste I would like to point to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our tavern.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it" "" "twin summit paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. they know and acknowledge him as the debt of the debt, which raises its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few know his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is one of unused savings and corporations that could be investing there, where it would be productive and income, with which one could produce debt and also all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the US, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the wealth of goods, such as industrial plant, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollars, after a lot of money, you compare it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that remained at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, apart from the stock markets and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which did not compensate through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which could not invest in which they do not invest. exactly as Ödipus father, who could not invest in which they could kill him, that his son would kill him if he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">Inrolled the circumstances that leads to that oil would kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely toxic capital should be deployed to improve our lives, developing human talents and particularly to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as a party form, in which the open and poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenish democracy were of course too many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, there would be an error, the wave value of athenic democracy in due to inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the athenic democracy was and is that they gave the working poor and not only the right to free expression, but more important and crucial, which they had the right to political co-determination with equal vote in questions of the government.</seg>
<seg id="935">Although the athenish democracy had not kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that illuminates very light, it is also fast as fast.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athen,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688 even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenian democracy focused on free citizens, the liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was reduced to politics during the economy -- the world of the corporations -- a democrayfree zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, since the time, at which the separation of politics and economy began, an inhereditary struggle between the two, the economy slowly moves politics and wandered them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Don't you wonder why the politicians are not so much more like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is possible that one can be able today in the government and still not in power because the power of politics in the economy are removed and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of smokers, lasting so sustainably the animals, of which they are nourished, decimated that they were hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy, which is so far-caused by the self-caused economic crisis itself, the power of the corporations grows, political goods increases, the overall economic demand, and the management of the corporations are suppressed, to invest the cash of their company.</seg>
<seg id="948">According to the successful of capitalism the "Demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher are the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human power and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" control reserves, as in the ancient Athen, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea about 100 years ago and it did not vanish them.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is only recurring a position as in the ancient Athen, without creating new species of brood and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: do the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wages by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin-rise higher, the waste coverage, and the social conflicts down deeper, as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must move the economy and unite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we have democratically democratically democratically democratically-related area, otherwise we are able to appear in a disease called "Matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether the technical achievements, which he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The interesting question is whether the capitalism is replaced by a Dystopie, similar to mankind's "" "" Star Trek "" "," in which machines serve the people and put their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora" "" "in long talks with the sense of life." ""</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "star Trek" like the "matrix" similar dystopie instead of the "matrix" -like Dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to call you shortly, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company: please make a capital market before you have earned and in which your capital is deserved from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one has just works -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and income, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">There is no distinction between those who work the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees working there, but the company does not include. no diver between capital and work, no big gaps between investments and pairs, and ultimately didn't lift up the twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please tell us that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuate exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [group of 20 largest thresholds], in the interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade will be traded in this currency -- as we call them "Cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and every government paying the sum of the country's trade deficit or the trade transfer of the country to a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that we had not had the technical resources at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have made it, especially in the background of a restored politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I cast you, is at the same time liberal, in which they preferred privileged persons, and marxistic, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the rubbish of the history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Become awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fall into a "matrix" - similar dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to have politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You are circumcised in your biography about the liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx 'Analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I had just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and business is... do not work that technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand, known as Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next, as we are currently living, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you think not enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said that. BG: in your presentation you have already mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner you have very clear what you have seen from the sight of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracy we have the ticket of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to the policy, during the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- a totally democraeFree Zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain regard, if I may say that so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- We tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptic, concerned the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can watch in China very similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now to take to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells massive to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious to your experiences as the Minister of Hellas in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely, to say goodbye to the self-payment period, and which denies that a massive displacement line through the Eurozone went and continues to be threatening the development of the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to open the first proposal on the basis of the Greek precursday -- the first proposal that denied this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It's right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European group, continued to denying it.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to receive an economic system that is non-viable, by political will and authorization to life, you may not hesitate any time, but if the change occurred, it happens abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have any future if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as a financial minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- harvest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister for Finance, or any Minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in a so-stressed situation, he claims not any error, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake had to submit the application for the extension of the training program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was a honourable interest in pages of the banknotes to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They had only wanted to fall our government, only because they didn't want to deal with temptations which ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to stand that she was a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika of the Banknote, which insisted to us this policy: "that was a colossal error."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be able to be right per-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolute.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone compared to someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest anxiety is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the embranded flickers will be Dämonish and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be catastrophic for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we propose to enter the path of a post-modern 1930, then it appears to be also subsequently committed to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope very that you lie wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price most of Roy has never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that met Roy before three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fighting sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any way.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows which are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are right on this turn right.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation division of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB Website. the rating is showing from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are preserved.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated by nine and above, this will be a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that one has seen a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left hand side, here on this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough, what is the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not respond to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to undergo "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean extinction, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that it really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so much, therefore I will not risky nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">It needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He occupies many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows it online where they can watch one for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is free things out, you're going to work correctly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed when watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team to capture everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">When you capture the show, when you start paused, what parts you skip and look at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to choose which show you should produce them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and it yields the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a SitCom over four Republican US transformers."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "alpha House," but it seems that not many of them can remember this show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7,4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- i.e. slightly above average, but not just what are Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time in another company, another manager has placed a top-show due to data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, it is always on the search to find this a super show and it is also used, but it does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a contest, he and his team looked forward to the existing data over the Netflix spectators, so the ratings they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they went into a venture and decided to do not a SitCom about four senators, but a drama series over a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this turn. so exactly there where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data versified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic indicates that it should work at all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision to meet you, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working, this is something terrifying because we live in a time, in which we have more and more to statistics in order to meet serious decisions, far beyond the TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in contact with this software in contact with this software. come in contact with this software.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If any one ask here in the US in prison, and in order to ask, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Medium TV, 22 minutes, this can be real bad, but still more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not possible that a company does not know how multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data versified companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that they could say through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worst way - by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news conference. the success came in a publication in the magazine "Nature".</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year by year until it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the publication of publication in the magazine "Nature".</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data versified companies such as Amazon and Google may be understood sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of these errors, data may abound in decisions of life an -- at the workplace, in case of legal decomposition, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-based Genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use unimaginable many data to meet serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you need to solve a complex problem, do mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, you will be able to analyse this issue in its sole parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second place you put together the single parts again to deal with a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you must do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important facts: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to destroy a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, even if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think that Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They utilize data to understand their audience better, for what they had not been able to get better. but the decision as to put all these parts, put together again and show a show like "House of Cards" which was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, what meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this to the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they played by TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they always could say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things are wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, this was the tool for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions regarding a Ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- exactly here in this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will make it later with a technique.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have met some decisions in my life, with what I could have to hear in the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace this by something much excling, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic body.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball clutger and klüger and clutger. finally, it's right to meet decisions if we want to reach something unusual at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I sensitivity this as a very encouraging message that it still has to pay attention in spite of the great amount of data, making decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks go.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end it is not the data but the risks, which you are landing at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very nice.</seg>
