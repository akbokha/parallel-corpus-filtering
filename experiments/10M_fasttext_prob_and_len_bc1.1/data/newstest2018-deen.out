Munich 1856 : four cards that change your sight to the city
an mistaken operation where young people are to meet today .
a greeting chapel , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is dug up .
the small gar@@ dener generate the lon@@ ely reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it nerv@@ ous when country cards are not present .
this knows everyone who had to give itself exc@@ itement , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i was taking place a green meadow instead of a paved road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as in the state government , are all the other than currently - but just therefore very thr@@ illed .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
then the cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a flip carpet , which one cannot recognize as such as such .
into the large map map for cities and municipalities detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ anium sheets , were incorporated .
these were made according to the Bavarian survey@@ or administration between 1810 and 1864 and ski@@ pping the first measurement of Bay@@ erns .
your Client : Napoleon .
in the spring of 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 with Austria .
Napoleon wanted a survey of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns in order - of course , of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops landed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville in February of 9 , 1801 : the present neighbours , which the idea of a surface @-@ covering of Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project again and founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian State Department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others in the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison Spring / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown steadily .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
the ship@@ yard was held 21 years after the creation of the map , so in 1877 , as a Munich district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of sub@@ se@@ d@@ lings concentrate around 1856 along the Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : when adding a smaller card with d@@ utz@@ ing lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ption , &quot; which was derived from the basic tax .
small plots there are no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area distingu@@ ishes itself north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Theres@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 , was the scene of the October , was actually a meadow , and there was no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the ur@@ anium sheet reads in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the road name &quot; at the restaurant &quot; or from the height &quot; On the fan , &quot; but also in big letters &quot; mistaken operation . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ field road there were once more people with mad@@ ness .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich District @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er fan . &quot;
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den initiated the institution - that psychiat@@ rist who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , to w@@ ander the so @-@ called .
in addition , he has directed the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the lawyer .
initially for 280 patients was first place , later it was expanded to 500 seats .
sometime , this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost has been there since 2006 , one of the largest psychiat@@ rist of Germany .
at the age of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um .
the Order received the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth camp with training courses .
West is the soccer field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , it was erected by the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - in architectural re@@ jection to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , who had been destroyed during the Second World War .
the Marien@@ platz was in 1856 as the &quot; main square , &quot; the merchants name was &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the allies of the Al@@ lies broke out in December 1944 many holes into the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once again on the Marien@@ hof , where this day began work and take place on April 5 , 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn railway line .
compare with the sli@@ der to compare the old Munich map with the aerial photo of today and fill the hole in the Marien@@ hof .
civil rights Group published travel agent for Missouri
the National Association for the Promotion of Colour has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discrimin@@ atory policy and ra@@ cial attacks by the State of Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Committee for the State of Missouri , which will be into effect by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner , as a number of frag@@ ment@@ ary events in the last time in the whole state and listed here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the Group .
a recent Act of Missouri , which human beings are difficult to win discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ utions authorities of the state , to ad@@ mitt@@ edly the group to publish the trav@@ ag@@ ation , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; you have violations of the civil rights that happen people .
they will be ro@@ uted because of their skin colour , they are defeated or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such an incidence that we haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has been issued for a state in the USA .
the group quoted inci@@ dents like ra@@ cial distortion against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol at the beginning of the year , after he had not taken any gasoline by the state and accused of the police of Missouri .
the Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of Missouri , in which black drivers are more common in the state 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is aware that people are aware of their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chapel said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people must be ready to bring with the money or the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Missouri was reported in the year 2015 100 Hass@@ elt , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ ver@@ ge Report of the FB@@ I , which stages the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country .
the travel agent is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult to acc@@ use a company for home or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel dates for Texas and Arizona , after the States have passed immig@@ ration authorities to under@@ take people because of immig@@ ration cases , which will contribute to the further development of AC@@ L@@ U .
travel dates are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of other countries , but in the last time , stak@@ eholder groups have been used as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA .
electric fence project is Elem@@ ent@@ ar
the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU Bundestag Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken place a picture above the spot .
at the sp@@ inning yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family met representatives of the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher CDU during the Association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted in@@ sights into his farm where he runs 55 hectares of meadows and 40 acres of forest cultivated , 40 dairy cows and equally many young animals and houses five apartments in five apartments .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald milk &quot; is the alternative way for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
on the table of the holiday guests are exclusively regional .
since he is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the &quot; Elem@@ ental Analysis as &quot; Elem@@ ental Analysis . &quot;
I can &apos;t bring back on der@@ art steep surfaces .
the green area for a lot of work , much must be processed with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stressed by Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he acquired the el@@ ter@@ nal operation and cultivated this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he has no bio@@ operation .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the community has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad to promote the Leader . &quot;
with costs from 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers have to be supported .
one hope that the car@@ pool@@ ing of the surfaces could still be pulled out a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and do thoughts on how they continued their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often responsible for the promotion of criticism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the dis@@ closure of the area is 40 hectares , which can not be missed until at least 2023 .
of the total costs of 71 500 Euro , half of the leader was funded by leader , a quarter carried out by the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
this means that the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of wheat .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmers and farming . &quot;
also for Peter White stood : &quot; here are the best food produced here . &quot;
the State Court of Baden @-@ Württemberg ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of wheat .
the goal is the dis@@ closure of the Black Forest .
a prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of the convey@@ ors of the L@@ PR .
in addition , the in@@ oc@@ ative area may not be evacu@@ ated ( slope over 35 percent ) and thus must be threatened by the fun@@ eral .
for the 2018 fish her@@ d@@ fence project in 2018 , the request of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .
the dis@@ closure of the area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are estimated at more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is now taking place in the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is it , if they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate the same as any other - hence the sor@@ ship of Saddam Hussein &apos;s sentence on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key Ide@@ ologist of Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he was a symbolic ax@@ e in a heat dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N about the proposals of the President to dra@@ stic immig@@ ration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue yourself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ilers and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have thought about it , when he had done it .
but he took their significance , and in particular the importance that her attributed to her , when the famous po@@ em of Emma Lazarus was added , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta im@@ min@@ ated : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the po@@ em that you refer to that later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ec@@ tively true , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really around history .
it is concerned about the contemporary reson@@ ance of Lazarus , the only one that invites you not only any old immig@@ rants , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your lab@@ ours , your poor , and thy be@@ ur@@ gent masses , that desire to bre@@ athe freely , and destruction of thy rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ et@@ ide &quot; was better to see our screens .
Miller committed himself not in literary criticism - he did not clear that these people are not welcome in the USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural con@@ front@@ ation : it is in fact a conflict in importance to the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who voted for themselves to place their words after her death - did very good that they had a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ s by showing a classical representation of the femin@@ ine representation of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its po@@ em is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a whole name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the po@@ em with the picture is a brilliant fem@@ inist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American Nati@@ vity .
and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to change the people from the right wing .
the Great Schrei@@ h@@ als Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was invited , but rather a early Ne@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , who wanted to bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not ligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something completely .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the position of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was in it to see them so as they had seen from the exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble travel on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear .
and this is not the perspective to recognize the Miller and Tr@@ ump .
their tor@@ ch should not shine the way , but the hat@@ red that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black is the Scottish members of the Team from Great Britain
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two fle@@ ets were belonged to the Team of Great Britain
the performance director of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world championship lead to a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special has been developed &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand and we will continue to continue until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m distance , whereas Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team to the team kap@@ elle .
Eil@@ id@@ h is quite modest .
their capit@@ als talk was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or where they live or train , went out of the room and felt very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the real feeling that Eil@@ id@@ h were very natural , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth of silver med@@ alli@@ sts who will compete for their fifth World Championships at the 400 m Hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 shots are in the British team .
in Scotland , the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ range Mu@@ ir runs on this way and has put up five British and two European records last year .
it will be part of the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of the rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another ch@@ at@@ las to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first world championships , when the only other sho@@ cks were in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the Romanian capit@@ als says that she is &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of her land@@ men had not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so special about the team cap@@ tures the team that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me to make it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise to Po@@ i .
what my speech is concerned ?
yes , I think it went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , since we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put this home support and benefit from it that we are again at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out and compete , and it &apos;s just like a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : don &apos;t take you a public post if you don &apos;t want to heat the elec@@ toral of voters
the father of our land knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him due to its political principles .
he sh@@ im@@ ed at the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he didn &apos;t have his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in the year 1783 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and dum@@ b , we shall be led as sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will bring me to Maryland for Govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work on it more than Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted your opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ al Union accused him in the beginning of this week .
the staff of the Govern@@ ors dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can Govern@@ or in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary head .
he has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his elec@@ tors and to de@@ buted its hair @-@ loose head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of people who come to the site of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and eventually dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ an spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse argu@@ ed the acts of the govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the comments of comments has nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of the un@@ controlled or spo@@ ilers or water filled people who are online the wh@@ ip &apos;s win@@ ches online .
the Post talked with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no role .
they all said that their comments are respec@@ t@@ ful , rep@@ utable , and not prof@@ ited .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appeal to H@@ og@@ an Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ illed but she asked to hate speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented it that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate , breaking down other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in the commentary area of the news release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think this idea , if a number of people on the same theme will take account , then they will be ab@@ used by some more than a so @-@ called collector and not as a large group of affected people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would like to call other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous days if you have had the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers and demonstr@@ ators to burn or demonstr@@ ators to burn or demonstr@@ ators .
but exactly that happens just digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials , which critic@@ ized for this , he has promised Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is pro@@ claim by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter Feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County promised First A@@ scen@@ ic , according to the US District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria when she was a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Pre@@ in ( R ) received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers spread between 1776 and 1800 , and an anonymous letter struck on his lead .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous t@@ roll .
the people , the pseud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
Pet@@ itions , which critic@@ ised its position concerning the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the United Kingdom critic@@ ized , according to the historical documents , collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not put them to silence .
free speech and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true guide means to accept that .

&quot; it &apos;s always a bit more if you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you felt this additional print .
I really enjoyed it again , and I played a sturdy golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad when it went far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades less people are dead because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are present in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases related to passive smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said study of Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved to this topic in 1994 .
at that time there are still 400 lung cancer cases because of passive smo@@ kes per year .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections are considered very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are reas@@ on@@ ably in time , &quot; as head of the building , Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the location is more complicated than expected , as in the underground a lot , which is not stated in the plans .
the traffic which is still ob@@ stru@@ cted the construction works , represents a great problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .

it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia when only 1.0@@ 26 elder was to vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement that asc@@ ended for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jakarta which includes control of the region and foreign journalists or legislation .
in 2003 , the Province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea was the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as a desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a tomorrow &apos;s 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ bo@@ o bricks , and made of corrugated boards , which were converted by rust in different gel@@ b@@ brown tones .

Pap@@ ua is the worst province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s disease and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an of Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a land of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was reduced by 3.1 billion US dollars and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a value of estimated $ 78 billion worth of estimated $ 78 billion .
however , these wealth , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indones@@ ians preser@@ ves a first @-@ level presence .
a study from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort Local Military @-@ Dollar and Units between 1998 and 2004 were almost 20 million US dollars , among them up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
papers claims after larger autonomy thre@@ aten these Golden G@@ ans and are treated with gn@@ aw@@ less .
according to the activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua has been killed and thousands were ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as St@@ es@@ up@@ land in the 1970 @-@ year @-@ old were sentenced to genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers last year alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we compl@@ ying everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report of the arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities are included in the previous year , such as in@@ legal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ envelop@@ es are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ Explorer for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts have strengthened , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development was altered since Muslim economic immig@@ rants from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .

the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and legal infr@@ in@@ gement in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann was 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has little changed , and today the nati@@ ves feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have tuned for j@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that righteousness will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point for two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas Car@@ ols in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the rock@@ ed children said to them that they should be able to switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a stum@@ bling part in her tone , and later returned to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their mou@@ ths , said victims and witnesses .
then , one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child who was 16 years old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ger@@ o , was so difficult to hit that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and the things calculated on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commander to ask justice .
they contributed to Colon@@ ial Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - in the circle and a bird heal@@ th@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe ago .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones to police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , a command was sent over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three resistance , they shoot it dead , &quot; says it is not released in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been released the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ fourth quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ id danger and called to rest and called the people to return home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned back , I was shot in my left hand , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame doesn &apos;t know who has been fired , but says that the sphere came out of the ranks of the people gathered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and taught his body to ensure that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who bears as many Indones@@ ians only a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the Chief Executive of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said Rep@@ or@@ ists that his officers could only secure their station , &quot; because they will be attacked .
&quot; we must defend us if people threatened to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man for the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the s@@ coff@@ ees arrived at the following day &apos; filtered &apos; after Jakarta .
in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate address in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims , and weak@@ ened the historical circumstances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like that this case will be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he had a extra@@ judicial mechanism for the side of historical human rights violations .
but the talk started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred recently .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ year .
the point is that we should have committed to walk these verses , but there are processes that need to pass through , &quot; said he .
then he made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jakarta with TI@@ ME , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , who demanded the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demanded that 11 cases of human rights violations in East Tim@@ or had already said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua has already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai pre@@ f@@ case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with fierce un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I have afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , was afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I was buried , the military , sought to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shooting saw did not hear .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a messenger , refused to bring an un@@ conscious man into the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was d@@ row@@ ned when it explo@@ ited in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
rising vill@@ agers in front of the company &apos;s site office .
the police told that the vill@@ agers had cast stones on officers who responded to them by warning warning .
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the amount and killed one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives in the vicinity of the hospital , and how the latter were come quickly , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to drag the officers to the account and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a wor@@ r@@ ying for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua , by joining spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response in recent years , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of the national so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some pl@@ unge them again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic and forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is as far as range .
people build here everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women that can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces not@@ a tast@@ ed only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
during the time , economic ine@@ qualities are grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants which have arrived at the opening of new air@@ fields to the Nab@@ ire airport in larger number .
the few jobs , which are in the region , will usually go to the better trained and we@@ al@@ thy migran@@ t migrants .
Pap@@ ua have sel@@ dom used the capital or the necessary skills to competitive their own company .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , the chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on the international media remain cl@@ amped .
at the beginning of the year , French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is elections , the restrictions on coverage to promote transparency and development , was not implemented .
&quot; there are new haz@@ ards for foreign journalists trying to report from Indones@@ ians in@@ tran@@ qui@@ um provinces of Pap@@ ua and West pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; said he in a statement .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ islands and the Salom@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have seen historically the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir presented the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so that it is difficult to desp@@ ise the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
the people want to know that more foreign governments should take this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Rights @-@ Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura broke out on May 4 , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that took part in the session , but anonymous to stay .
Indonesia is another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua will say that she probably won &apos;t be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is involved in the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ i , the chairman of the Chief Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the standing threat of an chemical military , is located in im@@ pover@@ ished educ@@ ating and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people like other Pap@@ ua , who have to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; fault &quot; that he has to rep@@ ay .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only justice , &quot; says he .
despite the thre@@ ats and en@@ rol@@ ments led families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ ers resulted in the last symbolic act of the Des@@ crip@@ ts : the bodies of an ox was buried on a terrain opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps there will never be justice , but at least let them do not forget her crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us , with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;s sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire was on Friday in one of the highest residential doors in Dubai in Dubai , in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that f@@ ails in only two years through the building , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we went up with fire alarm and when the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we caught the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told an inhabit@@ ant that gave his name as George , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting broke down before 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and the fire extingu@@ ishes the fire .
the government said that they work in the provision of shel@@ ters for the affected people .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage from the covering , outer covering for decoration or insulation came .
in Great Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the London &apos;s Gren@@ elle Tower in June may have contributed to the spread of a fire that died about 80 people .
no Davis @-@ Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis Associ@@ ations ( IT@@ F ) is due to its large Davis Cup @-@ cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , it was used for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winning sets , hood @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although the often very long , but also very well @-@ estimated five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional cause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states agreed to reform the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore barely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these ic@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
you will continue to work to improve the application .
not only until vote was come after many claims already before the proposal to add the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 can only be smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will start the next round in the next round .
in order to reduce the organizers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training places , etc . and players will have to complete the fewer official media appoint@@ ments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US traveler brings forbidden objects into a plane , finds a survey
a survey conducted among passengers have revealed that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ated or un@@ aware of objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which contributed the aircraft while they were acci@@ dentally banned knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent , they would have been delayed , that they have been ir@@ rati@@ onal@@ ized with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather disp@@ at@@ ched the rules .
by the respon@@ dents , the allow@@ ances that they have tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that have been buried at T@@ SA agents were foods and liquids .
more than 3 per cent accounted for , wi@@ per objects have borne by the security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents have also confirmed that they had been deliber@@ ately sent drugs into the plane .
the company said , question@@ ing trav@@ ellers in all the country about trying to find out how many acci@@ dentally Schm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware was brought to the airport security and how many it had done it clearly .
there is no surprise that people who have the most frequent sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware - wi@@ per or im@@ pregn@@ ated - by safety , those who were most frequently fly .
the company shows that the T@@ SA directives are slightly complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uns@@ af@@ e that liquids may take it , or how much of it .
so , there is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids in the T@@ SA are conf@@ is@@ cated .
a time for long thought the people who T@@ SA could see books as Schm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed in domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla clients order Order
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are happy with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has now propose that part of the customer has withdrawn its engagement to their non @-@ binding reservations already .
besides the ever triumph@@ al figures , Tesla @-@ chief El@@ on Mus@@ k has announced another , less smooth figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance : the cancellations made for the new mass market @-@ model 3 .
Mus@@ k had commonly used more than 500,000 orders for the new car in recent months , whose delivery is just beginning .
now Mus@@ k is a : of the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 preliminary orders have been withdrawn from 63@@ .000 .
critics had always been pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla is charged EUR 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
currently 45@@ 5.000 of these non @-@ refundable reservations confirmed , Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
however , the cancellation of so far has around twelve percent of all orders to be solved , but the Tesla boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not on demand but on the production site .
in the past year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
it is expected to be merged with all models - 500,000 - one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k currently , 1800 reservations are present .
who can order today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla created it , its brand new , still never seen in practice @-@ tested production lines with maximum utilization of utilization .
many experts doub@@ ts that this is possible .
but comes to bigger del@@ ays , then the un@@ binding of reservations may be used for Tesla .
for then , the company can not stop the customer &apos;s satisfied customers in Sch@@ aren d@@ av@@ on@@ .com .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt is moving back to reduction in emissions due to the execution of Obama @-@ Er@@ a .
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environment Protection Agency , withdrew its former decision to del@@ aying the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g created air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities in contrast faster than previous destruction .
he did not mention the complaint against his previous place in a Federal Court of Appeal .
it is going to be a term that ran on 1 October for States to comply with the standards of under@@ floor ozone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would like to accept the observ@@ ance of a year to study the plan to study the plan and to avoid &quot; themselves in local decisions &quot; or to handic@@ apped economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump State At@@ tor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt is repeated to block or delayed , to block the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the most recent legal withdrawal for the regulatory submission of the run@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA Ver@@ wal@@ ter exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama Administration , oil and gas enterprises on monitoring and reduction of me@@ than@@ le@@ cks .
in a on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt set out that his mit@@ re @-@ turn in ozone @-@ standards easily reached the will@@ ing@@ ness of EPA to cooperation with the states by the complex process of satis@@ fying the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former destruction , the EPA often accused the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then been indicted for the implementation of activists and others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation of trial procedures , and we take dead@@ lines .
we also take the law and authority who gives us , seriously . &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of EPA that P@@ ru@@ suffered sometime his &quot; powers of delay and all other legally available , &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans can hold on a comprehensive new version of the ozone rules .
one last month approval bill should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years .
the measure has not been changed in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States who accused the EPA in this week , said the Group intends to just@@ ify the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the return of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6,7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , &quot; said inc@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York was in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ Oz@@ on originates when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refined plants , chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere &apos;s atmosphere react to sunlight .
the smo@@ g smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups and contribute every year to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health issues and the environ@@ ment@@ alists rejoiced over P@@ ru@@ by surprise visitors .
&quot; it is wor@@ r@@ ying , as much pressure it needs to receive this sen@@ sible step by the person responsible for the protection of the air that we bre@@ athe &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological cruci@@ fix@@ ion of the Tr@@ ump government to tackle environmental protection and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Walter Martini : &quot; it is a unique little town . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg Ur@@ gent Ur@@ gent documents : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the most well @-@ known parish church at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark sterling silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger Berg , the former parish church was also a splendid courtyard , which belonged to the church or the patron of the patron church , and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
like from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt in 1858 , beside the village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the town of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid village centre of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 , these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht was created from the early medieval native law .
one lord , who built a church , took out and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also be heir to this owner .
thus it was the right to use a priest , or to act a new priest for the bishop .
three altars were in the church , and two bells on the tower .
the greatest of the two zer@@ oes on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was then launched in 16@@ 92 , but later was to be submitted to the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 1648 ) the windows were stolen and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops inv@@ aded the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as a fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to overthrow 1809 .
by 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius C@@ emetery served as the last resting place for the dead .
in 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the tower tower had to stand .
in 1834 a storm sunk the tower in 1834 and the half collap@@ sed .
to prevent an evil , the tower was demolished .
only today still existing tower @-@ wer@@ g stayed as a witness of the 750 years old church history .

Association intends to check approval from wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; looks no legal prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for construction and has therefore turned to the land rat .
the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; Association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; has been promp@@ ted to withdraw his approval for the erection of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is lawful to be un@@ lawful .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in square , only at the border border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal already exists a wind force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines generally possible , the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind turbines for the rest of the city .
such zones are supposed to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
although the town of Vier@@ sen had a second wind power supply zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette that had not approved a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but it was not approved because of a form@@ ul@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the missing planning prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite the approval of approval is to be un@@ lawful and therefore back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council once again decided before the summer break again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval from the District government is still standing .

with the construction of four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households will be covered - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ four households .
the NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer there was fourth light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .

Tr@@ ump replaced the tran@@ scription of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump called Tr@@ ump on a telephone line with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to hear , publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President ha@@ iled him , because he publicly disp@@ uted the wall in public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first an@@ ru@@ fs with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ st@@ ems have also been published and un@@ cover an un@@ cl@@ amped exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Tr@@ ump said that a trade for the United States who emigrated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was convey@@ ed by the government Obama , had suggested him as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Moo@@ res Ford Mass@@ acre : activ@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as an Call for Justice
a 1948 @-@ old Ford Mercury went through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge by Moore .
before the car , which could reach four black passengers and a white driver that could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man medium @-@ middle age in a needle stage - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside reverse the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get him from the car ! &quot;
sh@@ y out the silence , when a young man was broken off from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this awesome scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a re@@ im@@ position .
but when a sn@@ ails were thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , nearly all of the audience will hit very real sig@@ h .
since 2005 , citizens come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Doro@@ thy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was charged because of the murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able that in all these years no only person was arrested - though we see them in our municipalities , though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who assi@@ sts in the organization &apos;s organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of Georgia and a life of Citi@@ zenship .
for him , it serves as a dramatic call to the action and represents a yearly memory of the Monroe Community that has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to refuse the termination , we want to make healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can not get to healing and reconciliation until we received righteousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a place of jurisdiction covers a beg@@ ging of a victim of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne victims on July 27th , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files , the N@@ BC News were received , over 50 men of Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , Citi@@ zens believes that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in all the city was always well @-@ known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the ruling of the Supreme Court ruled the black citizens in Georgia to aband@@ on their vote in the summer .
at about the same time as the election comes according to the FB@@ I of the black colour guard Roger Mal@@ com a white land @-@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - supp@@ os@@ edly due to a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that was rum@@ our of the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Doro@@ thy slept and that the baby she bore her , not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a famous white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , as the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Doro@@ thy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they were then away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared the mur@@ ders and arranged , &quot; includes a FB@@ I report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspi@@ racy between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the mur@@ ders , evidence den@@ ounced and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more fun .
&quot; it was a constitu@@ ent massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register , and when you vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost one decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene directed the annual replica of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vi@@ vid , gri@@ pping and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe he does not exist in America .
it is difficult to view , and even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are con@@ fron@@ ted with its reliability in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and the first day pressed almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - into a room and lau@@ ched , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ens Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the Chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ ter &apos;s role in years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive because we would not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the ester scre@@ ams and pushed him to make sure that he slept with his wife Doro@@ thy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I be@@ g , missing from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out at all ( at least every black actor ) .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked S@@ cona .
he is al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just didn &apos;t believe that white people then &apos; n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ches are one of the other black actors .
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and just as move the energy in the room , a feeling of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene will start again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
these repet@@ ition ends and fast .
there are Schre@@ ie , shots and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a sad@@ ness , stands over the course of actors and performs Billi@@ e Holidays Trau@@ ern@@ de Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
their voice breaks out in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators swe@@ pt and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost evenly between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many are just down the street .
they have experienced all nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing humidity if Bro@@ oks they lead to a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an A@@ ne@@ c@@ d@@ ote , but now on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels .
if the last notes of the songs , Gre@@ ene invites the quantity to come closer and inspec@@ ting the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the quiet body and whis@@ per one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy when he would remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ens of the crowd - and suddenly there is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x eil and w@@ aged their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw killed Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit who has played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona surro@@ unds two of his co @-@ players and breaks out in their poor wine , and the emotional burden of the performance was finally sh@@ aken by him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this out of a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience with the actors to dinner together .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta also stim@@ ulates a white pair with a black pair that they just know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski fought to find words that the feeling has left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and acts ... of people coming like you look like yourself and those who do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really can do with me , believe me that the Lyn@@ x will still go further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks is holding his table on his table , he &apos;s eating and remin@@ is@@ cent of the civil rights .
he said that he started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the im@@ position is inspir@@ ing , because she describes the terror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is convicted to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; go@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf reli@@ es on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging of gigantic , six @-@ storey scenery .
the rotary platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a fo@@ b@@ ypass street corner with the wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR &apos;s times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before , an open Mercedes vintage car , in which the Rhine is m@@ apped as a Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
the oil prices are remin@@ ded of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mot@@ iv - money , power , and g@@ ier - which is moving through its &quot; ring . &quot;
the three Rhein@@ k@@ ills of Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .

the audience than@@ ked the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
stor@@ my celebrated F@@ ost@@ er , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski decided to form a modest and hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ er .
there is a big case for the festival orchestra which shows the stage for the first time - in view of the big heat again in Leg@@ erer leisure clothes .
the appearance was not expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his home team .
in 2013 , he still had to leave the pipe &apos;s wh@@ ist@@ le Concerto for himself , and there were five years later great singing in which the cov@@ eted &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; ru@@ ff went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it &apos;s also a understanding for its visual fields .
I will draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as volunteers
they work in their volunte@@ er year immediately on several places .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once in the week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in the open full day at school .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with adolescents , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late volunte@@ er volunteers .
how does that come ?
quantity : I &apos;ve done S@@ LC .
and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say successful .
I recognized for me that it is for me and I want to make something different to work with people .
and then I asked me what do you do .
make a social year , as there is an insight , since it is possible to see how it is on site , at the burning point perhaps too , really is .
and was it so ?
amount : I have gathered great impressions .
I will start my studies in social welfare in winter semester .
I will study dual , do you expect a social worker education and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different applications during the volunte@@ ering service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes to it , where to make his FS@@ J .
one can make it from the Alter@@ n@@ sheim to youth welfare - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partially in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was exactly the right thing that has ger@@ min@@ ated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
differently than in construction engineering ?
amount : sure , here we do not expect to calculate st@@ resses .
it always has some other people at the head , each of which have a very different story behind themselves .
whether a refugee who has been picked up out of the family - one must always go individually .
very interesting .
and they had no touch @-@ anxi@@ ous ?
quantity : I am not the type .
it is a field that gives a lot .
lots of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so it is life .

in a position of NATO , the explosion occurred on Thursday night , when a joint pat@@ rol was attacked by a united pat@@ rol of the Afgh@@ ani army . &quot;
the statement states that all injured in a stable condition are in a stable condition and in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram .

EPA returns to delay of the Smo@@ g rule after complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to del@@ aying a regulation of Obama administration , as to which the states are obliged to em@@ bank@@ ments the smo@@ g created emissions . this took a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced its decision on Wednesday the decision to gr@@ ate the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ozone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency , together with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and remember that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA , the ozone regulations - which should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , to determine where deposits must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - by a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the District of Colombia , filed an appeal against Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re@@ constru@@ ct a wide range of environmental conditions that the former President Barack Obama has raised the economic growth , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have caused the back of the Democrats and reserves groups that worry about the impact of larger emissions to public health .
the EPA website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , ozone does not contain &quot; lung function and boost respir@@ atory symptoms &quot; as an example as@@ thma .
joint venture to shared space
at the end , the decision was significantly : with two counter@@ voices , the Municipal Council decides to establish a joint space in the future senior citizens in the future .
prior to discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the lack of land was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reports .
although it is still going to date , until the date of the church community , there is no planning event for this project , but there is no planning permission for the project by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a shared space .
one of the two investors who are still in the ship , offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would be a living space - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with some 70 square meters floor space available for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council are before , such a shared space is not just as meeting point for the residents of the sens@@ ory righteous living , but open to the church .
for example , the word of the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision , which has been decided by provision of funding from the ongoing budget for the ongoing budget in the last autumn .
the construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a shared space would be , so T@@ j@@ ades can be eligible with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision will see to sign@@ alize the investor , that you don &apos;t want to submit to him in this regard to the legs , the conclusion that both sem@@ an@@ - - what is reduced to the ambient temperature and the construction cost - which would be possible .
unnecessary , so do not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be the addition .
if it helps : unanimously , he passes the panel .
it is not so easy with the shared space .
Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings , with which you do not come forward with the shared space of the window , says it : &quot; I do so difficult to do it . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks to the community room - however , absolutely against a municipal participation .
she looks behind it with a conce@@ aling payout of trouble and un@@ profitable investors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of an area you do not give a sub@@ sid@@ y but get a real , in doubt the market value , the counter @-@ speech is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers request to increase the decision of the decision , finds three fears . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it remains with two counter@@ voices at the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; if we hold the decision , we make a huge step where a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

in the resin of Stern to Stern
the national park is supposed to be the first &quot; star path &quot; in the Harz Mountains .
this is planning the association Z@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet away in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get contrary to the information needs of many har@@ les@@ ions , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connect nature , science , movement and sporty performance .
the members want to expos@@ e along the planned route panels and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase to 2018 the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ reaching installations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planning to reach five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ask boxes of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ e@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the panels should be supplemented by internet .
that is why the site selection is a good mobile network reception .
also accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ path the viewer will learn a lot of knowledge , for example , on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; declared the club .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star stronger than another , although it is much further away .
it will also be convey@@ ed in which constellation is a selected star , and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , at the highest alt@@ servatory in northern Germany .
according to information from the federal national park , according to the federal state of natural protection , the regions of nature conservation is one of the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye are clearly visible .
in the university town there has been a little similar to the planned star of Plan@@ et@@ arium since 2003 .
starting in front of the hotel in the Goethe the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet track leads up to Hain@@ berg and ob@@ servatory - as well as a &quot; alien &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Gl@@ em@@ arden ) .
the panels with the single planets - including the d@@ warf plan@@ ed Pl@@ u@@ to at the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one at two billion .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k so on a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 75 meters away from the sun at least 70 centimeters .
the entire distance of the planet is four kilometers .
during the light of sun up to Pl@@ u@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to st@@ ele with Pl@@ u@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the world .
the march to the next fixing is still a half year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o meet for the first time in discuss a possible show down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who would stand in a coll@@ ision to direct the most exciting boxing campaign in near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the unbe@@ atable World Box@@ ing Council Ligh@@ tweight Champion , the hall@@ way down to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ suspension Champion .

&quot; I am a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; remin@@ ded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have risen again for Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so big .

I want to download on light weight .
and he has to move on light weighted &#91; 135 &#93; &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give us this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o voted .
&quot; boxing needs this battle . &quot;
climate said whether it should be on pay for Pay @-@ per @-@ View , a portion of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to make the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight @-@ weight struggle in the forum on September 23rd .

four last post @-@ tire bur@@ gs
four people were seriously injured during an accident on the A7 in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost at 4.@@ 30 shortly before the connection station market wide probably after a tire board the control over its vehicle .
the passenger car left to the right into the bows , where he dropped and then lying on the roof@@ top of the grass .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the past through the rescue service , A7 was closed in direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left @-@ hand strip on the left @-@ hand side was buried .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ aming chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 to the season open@@ er to Braunschweig , that optim@@ ise the optimization of defensive information in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as they were not the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ers too much , and we need to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defensive player from Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the thresh@@ ing chain will also be further optimized .
and a fool after a state , the bar@@ ns will not want to catch up even more .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is getting better right after the experience in preparation with the rotating chain , than with the four @-@ seater .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure &quot; because we have just build up in the rotating chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but we are still better harmon@@ ize and we don &apos;t aff@@ ord a lot of playing errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you don &apos;t want to talk to a mis@@ sal start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are going to focus on Sunday with four points and can be concentrated on the cup we will certainly speak of one ordinary season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thereof , his coach wanted to know nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not speak of a advantage compared to Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can begin the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that the player from Au@@ e might even be some fresh , since they had no he@@ avi@@ est and complete game like Fortuna with a asc@@ ension into the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the guests go out of the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take away them away , only because we have the right to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2 . Bundesliga you have to beat the first in the second league , &quot; says Fort@@ is Chief coach .
&quot; a such statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gant and su@@ stain@@ ably . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his player on Sunday in no case .
new findings of Swedish asylum evaluation tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( soci@@ o @-@ nov@@ ice ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , the assessment of the age should be more precise , having critic@@ ised the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ation@@ et ) due to lack of correct age of some refugees who were min@@ ating .
by now mig@@ r@@ ations@@ et was sent 6,@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency acted that the person might be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person may possibly be below 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are only done in cases where the age of person is being question@@ ed .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant during the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years , does not necessarily means that asylum seek@@ ers have lied over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there was 4@@ 42 cases , the &apos; propose that the subject person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det out the 5@@ 81 published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person said that it will be 18 years old in this year .
the method of medical care , in the X @-@ ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRI images will be analyzed , which then critic@@ ized by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was critic@@ ized in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ cian is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institut , whose work comprises the evaluation of biological maturity of people to see if they were earlier or later than usual by the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used .
to assess this way , the biological age is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it safe , we should not do so as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
however , G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to assess a child as an adult in@@ correctly .
the biggest risk is in this case when the person is under 18 , in this case this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full in the Plan
the work on the three bridges from the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg will come well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at that time , it runs super , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Easy , building manager at the department of road and traffic in the government &apos;s office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began on all three san@@ itation @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is set to hold .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it is now come to the years .
in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three construction works are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons heavy called Br@@ ück@@ enk@@ ins .
this is a Rand@@ om fixing that is used as an operating path .
the southern part of the bridge should be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meters wide bridge cap .
then the pedestrian path should be left .
the special thing is that it deals with finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented Br@@ ück@@ enk@@ o .
particular finger@@ tips has the effect of leads through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre optic cable , which are connected to many companies .
the residents were informed in advance of the work through hand@@ writing about the project .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ sis had to be put out .
for the bridges between the building building and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher city entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is closed .
the cost of the three fires accounted for 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ ak in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower in protest with German potato salad
it &apos;s not so frequent before parties to draw on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to put into a hat .
the parties of the Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcan@@ ei@@ fel parties ( CDU , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a wide alliance , this day peace@@ fully flag indicates because the Af@@ ak in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites to the poster &quot; large elections . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already in front of the event will not want to listen to the Af@@ D athletes but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city @-@ pic@@ n@@ ick was originally planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now take place on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ak event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful image that has to offer .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the forum and one of the principal organis@@ ers , is pleased : &quot; great , how many people are gathered here . &quot;
there are music and lots of food , among them a &quot; ur@@ ian potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ ak , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police has ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , and shows presence in front of all , even at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ ak come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel reported that he ende@@ av@@ oured to ende@@ av@@ oured such an event and get a supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had initially asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ ch are not enough parking spaces available .
now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ ot is pleased that &quot; we can have a nice event here . &quot;
with a look at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , Main thing , it remains peace@@ fully . &quot;
this also does : around 20 o &apos;clock , the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , including the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate Af@@ D leader Uwe boy .
in the hall about 200 list@@ eners who are waiting to wait for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Prime Minister Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch will keep their spe@@ ech@@ es .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the civil servants had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ ak event , which guests have at the fore@@ ground have a longer breath , but also there is a long time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can decorate - no particular inci@@ dents .

both sol@@ o@@ ists are winning and pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in the European Choir Olympics .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is the SWR Symphony Orchestra of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both un@@ ites the lust , not only to exceed the limits on their instruments , but also the limits of the different gen@@ res are mer@@ ging .

this part of the program was first performed in spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer Nils W@@ ipe has written it specifically for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with her special acou@@ st@@ ics becomes aware of the concert with her special acou@@ st@@ ics .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her Bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart totally open on her bis@@ exual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I think once in gr@@ illed cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hollywood star was the one of her &quot; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately went down bitter .
despite all of all the brun@@ ette of the brun@@ ette , opposed to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in every serious , I have seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or believe you about , I have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after its separation , Kri@@ sten declared that they were bis@@ exual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been fl@@ aming or ham@@ per@@ ed .
I could not only never be taken away . &quot;
especially among them suffered under &quot; B@@ ang show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in the school season , as they prefer rather like a Bu@@ b : &quot; not all the girls are typical girls .
this really has really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children said , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt every attack@@ ing and damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I am looking back and think about : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public would not allow her love to live : &quot; the people expect you to have a certain way and is anno@@ ying me .
and perhaps I can call myself some as an und@@ ou@@ sine , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify my audience in front of all the public . &quot;
the Govern@@ or of West Virginia Announ@@ ces that he changes the party
the Democratic Govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party .
if you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of offspring ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will not help you as a inhabit@@ ant of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow , I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before@@ hand a great announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice does not endor@@ sed the democratic candidates in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , according to Forbes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes states that he has inher@@ ited coal in five states , and inher@@ ited a carbon store from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening was a statement that said : &quot; the party exchange of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party who would like to work to us rather than to do our country again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Government and the control of the least judicial bodies in history , the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is from top to bottom without leadership and is not able to find a positive , reas@@ on@@ ful message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a declaration by the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rus@@ sian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sorry for d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al
the global leader of athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , lob@@ ster on Thursday , what he described as obvious exc@@ use in Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sport .
Russia &apos;s World Athlet@@ ics Chef D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ac@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF World Championships on the eve of World Athlet@@ ics World Championships that he was correct in the sport that he was determined to combat d@@ oping .
he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all the athletes who have been cut out gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban , which was suspended in November 2015 , after a report of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) was found on state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very hon@@ our@@ able presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has proven itself in itself , that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will make everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is also pleased that Russia would accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very reconstructed day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything in the next months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the gui@@ ding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the with@@ ered system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the World Athlet@@ ics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re@@ setting .
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and prohibited Trainer are still free , he said Rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
fun@@ eral for Mali killed soldiers
at a fun@@ eral service at the North American Fr@@ itz@@ lar around 1000 people have thought about 1000 people with a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security options .
on the un@@ explained circumstances , the Minister of Defence said to Urs@@ ula from the Ley@@ en ( CDU ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she called the two fighter pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ ould of their specialist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to us in front of the highest victims which they have obtained in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen were living on Wednesday a week before a week of West African Mali .
her mer@@ ges were transferred to Germany and was accompanied by a dead guard of the German Armed Forces in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter on Thursday .
at noon on the lunch , only the relatives of the church was divided .
after that began the fun@@ eral in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Armed Forces and the politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
trau@@ matic rose ro@@ ses , and the relatives stood on his arm in arms .
before the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
the Minister of Defence of the Ley@@ en called the converted soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and one sat@@ in .
the Chief Prosecutor had built the flight operation of the fighting helicopter Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar with one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his reg@@ im@@ ents .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Commander of Reg@@ iment , who belong to the soldiers , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn the crash , nobody would have mo@@ ck . &quot;
doubt at the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of Ley@@ en did not be : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he was also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a land which we are separated from two countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral , the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they will be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried following his wife .
it divided the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish Royal Queen is buried in the Cathedral Church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ø@@ r@@ n N@@ ø@@ r@@ ga@@ ard had already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen is to agree with the decision of their man , it was called to be published in the notification .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French hom@@ eland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a command that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ ill@@ iter@@ acy of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to have been King .
in 2016 he retired from retirement , and also sets the title &quot; prin@@ cess &quot; .
since Hen@@ rik did not receive the title and the function that he wanted to see himself in comparison with his wife , not even after death , said L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the principal speakers of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will be still un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French hom@@ eland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native of Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble sex , had learned Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ etic notes of the people will always be flo@@ at , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy duty in his nearly 50 @-@ year @-@ old reg@@ ent@@ ele in Denmark &apos;s Dan@@ es .
in a auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ized .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk cr@@ amps instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ot , which I smo@@ ked in instead of Virginia tobacco and to be able to have the reputation to be the brand of single critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I couldn &apos;t trust .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and would not be ashamed .
that were just two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of the possible majority in Lower Saxony
low @-@ exist@@ ance Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke out on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising end of a Green @-@ M@@ EPs from their landing area in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its close @-@ to @-@ vote majority in the Parliament from CDU and F@@ DP .
the present Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets formed its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; declared it on Friday in Hannover on Friday .
CDU Quest@@ ionn@@ aire Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ sm@@ ler wants to recommend it to his Group .
thus , CDU and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
to date , the relationship was vice versa .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected to the 14th of January next year .
Th@@ ess@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they could reg@@ ain without a majority in this situation .
however , Stephan Weil has however , however , is indisp@@ ens@@ able for indisp@@ ens@@ able that the Parliament will rapidly resol@@ ve his self @-@ resolution .

&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these possibilities must be legally tested , &quot; said Th@@ ess@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they will destroy all the questions when they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect us from gi@@ ft@@ ist , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed above per@@ ate eggs .
how could the sc@@ and@@ al happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
the Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is written in the interview with the editor for Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers like to check the eggs in your refrigerator exactly and check out the stamp printing .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Länder represent the latest information on the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if everything we know currently , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
is now Al@@ di the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance is not really being perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
the food control is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house is immediately shut down and has been dis@@ closed since dis@@ closure of Germany in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade as well as the manufacturers ensure that the selling products are competitive and health harm@@ less .
if the resi@@ sts of the return level of 0,00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not capable of traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time is not the business .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after the ze@@ al characteristics , the production plants meets no immediate fault .
rather , it must reck@@ on due to mut@@ ually illegal practitioners from service companies with economic damages .
as always there are too little control in the harvest .
is it missing only at the personnel or also at the cas@@ ual jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
however , the truth is , however , that food and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent .
just therefore , a consequ@@ ent en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of such events and hand@@ over to the Heads of State in the cases , in which criminal off@@ ences can be crucial .
I have already made several times better that I expect a complete re@@ conn@@ aissance of the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm clock really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively secure and competitive food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumer goods and consumers are righ@@ ted .
by the ge@@ ared means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers do not use a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des Fi@@ f@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ exist@@ ent animals is not acceptable and must be completed immediately .
it has to be consistently implemented on all levels and with high pressure .
I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is spe@@ ech@@ ing and am@@ eless .
how to express the rules of rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to Paris
the rules , which targets to avoid un@@ compens@@ ated issues of European football , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris @-@ Saint Germain do not distur@@ b .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEFA , for the leading organisation , which super@@ vis@@ es European game teams , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEFA in 2011 means that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy Bras@@ ili@@ aner from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will cost several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to France .
PS@@ G can loose the money with security that N@@ ey@@ mar signs and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , in view to the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich ruler family of Qatar .
one may apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to control the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business to them .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini according to his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
former French players believed that clubs , who had taken tremendous debt after success , effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ ed to ru@@ in when banks or owner went back their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P fell from the concentration to the debt of the clubs on monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Ab@@ ram@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested in order to build a global brand - to a har@@ der issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P deposits , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take the losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini dropped from the presi@@ dency in un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to hold a moderate expenditure of spending money .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we are going to strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract for the coming five years in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 together with Abu Dhabi which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to persu@@ ade their financing vision by companies associated with the owners of a clubs which are linked to owners of a clubs .
while a cat@@ fish that could make up the PS@@ G value , if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings should not exceed the default market rates , the UEFA could not apply as leg@@ it@@ imes revenues .
exactly that happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA is b@@ lown off by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar will come to Qatar about payments of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar WM amb@@ ass@@ adors will be simply trying to find out a strange maneu@@ ver for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G would mean that the UEFA were even atten@@ tive , every attempt to note the rules .
the UEFA had no preparing talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , sag@@ ger on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said among the condition of An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 revenues generated with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last fiscal year must be published yet .
PS@@ G anticip@@ ates that N@@ ey@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing the signing .
the Spanish League was definitely irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players go to see and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to prevent her that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to cat@@ ars last owner of PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene W@@ enger , whose club is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the Reserv@@ ations of La League for a state that financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner &apos;s consequence , and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a land has an club , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because you have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;

fight against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar Circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konstan@@ z , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects seek out how the public prosecutor in Konstan@@ z were ha@@ sted on Friday .
15 years of age ranged from 25 years to 77 . arrest warran@@ ts have been issued against these arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , civil servants set the larger amounts of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
at the same ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
therefore , the two are likely to be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian Invest@@ ors were involved in the action .
in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were used .
members of the Mafia , organized drug crimin@@ ality , severe violent , en@@ su@@ ed murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y and pressing .
the public prosecutor in Konstan@@ z has been determined in the South German area since the summer of 2016 .
between the national attor@@ ney in Konstan@@ z and Palermo , an re@@ active exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the big deployment on Wednesday morning also was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
mainly Italian national nationals with regard to Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
a incident on 27 May in the morning in the morning , several shots were fired at the early morning , should go to the Ban@@ de &apos;s account .
wise compl@@ ains great g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not occur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to part mis@@ sal with asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has given attention to a media report on large g@@ aps in the country &apos;s country e@@ alog@@ ical register .
defic@@ ien@@ cies when registered data could be carried out in case of asylum procedures and de@@ shi@@ fts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an analysis that lies the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the regi@@ sters , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been maintained enough , the quality of the data in parts have not been fine so far .
in individual cases , dates from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long have been far more alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not stop anymore in the register . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ective data rate can significantly reduce return processes , &quot; says it according to the report .
in the statistics on immig@@ ration people , the EU citizens are listed , that would not have to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false orders led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but led to a dist@@ ressed debate on dealing with immig@@ ration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to return to Italy , refugee families with children under 16 years of age when they went to Italy .
this will go out from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ zn@@ ab@@ rec@@ er Zeitung reports . &quot;
according to the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except for infants and infants - after Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was no longer possible , as a reference to the difficult situation in reference to the difficult situation .
following the Dublin agreement , the EU is responsible for refugees in the EU .
when a migran@@ t travels to another EU country , this state may send him back to the immig@@ ration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy has submitted for inclusion and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold this additions for sufficient .
other EU states will also send refugees in the context of the Dublin agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ized this decision : &quot; families with children above , because of the defic@@ ien@@ cies in the Italian asylum system of human rights conditions and a end@@ anger@@ ment of childhood . &quot;

the Bank of England is holding interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the spec@@ ulation about a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain when she held the interest rates on family income in the middle of a ampli@@ fied pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted in 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , whereby in this month fewer members need a rise , since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its fourth annual inflation report the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.6 % and in 2018 that the pressure would continue to continue to rise to bud@@ get@@ ary growth , while the inflation would fall to almost 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ posted that in the next few years ago , interest would be necessary to bre@@ athe out by the Bre@@ x@@ ite , and she said that the credit costs may have to climb more than expected to the financial markets .
the members voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth package , which was issued prior to the Bre@@ x@@ ite before a year .
it will require time for the financing plan to al@@ locate the funding for banks , although it was said that she is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the real income of households will continue to pay the consumption . &quot;
at Inter@@ est rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain extent of monetary policy would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; extent necessary than the markets expect .
markets showed the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank continued to take gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank forecast down@@ wards revised growth forecast for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to May in May .
it retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures , increasing expectations on interest in interest , and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly recover after the bank towards the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered a little enthusiasm for households that are affected by an increasing inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the dis@@ appearance is still worse before they get improved .
she added that monetary policy was unable to prevent the income of income in the next few years , &quot; but she added that wages became clear &quot; in the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ unds and is compens@@ ated for a portion of lower consumer spending .
the decision is a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % over the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ nel .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until the prices and the economy will be fully reach .
prior to the final decision of the Bank on interest rates , the call was increased after an interest rate , because inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation has decreased by 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected to withdraw it in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exceeding on the ratio to its target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ara Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shorter return of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ g@@ ages market might be more competitive , as the loan sam@@ pler would be looking strong to shops and will end the year in positive way .
the market is particularly well suited for those who run the existing Deals and include the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should rub affected HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ itory &quot; HIV pre@@ valence .
in N@@ HS England , N@@ HS England announced that one before sexual intercourse recorded the risk of high risk emissions by around 86 percent , now the health service provided by a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10.000 people .
he was ready to finance the process after the Appeals Court confirmed a verdict of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year , according to that of the N@@ HS the powers had to pay for the Pr@@ EP , despite the claim that local authorities should finance him .
the Thursday announced chess suit was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be to the first one who will make the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October 2018 in the whole of England .
pre@@ exposure sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of a HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission at the risk of infection .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that enough medicines in the body are present in a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medication can be taken every day or as long as two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to the treatment , the schw@@ ule or bis@@ exual men , Trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners , have not been treated successfully .
in the clinics are suitable to agree that the study agree , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who are living in England and registered with a house@@ doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local sexual clinic .
the program is signed at £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the medicine in this week after an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study will evaluate the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by investig@@ ating clinical evidence , as it is applied in large scale , and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts towards the prevention of HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of persistent progress in the benefit of one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive of the NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP when it is targeted specifically to needy and end@@ anger@@ ed people , the possibility to change the English HIV @-@ epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England , to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a partner with a partner that leads to improve many many lives .
we welcome you this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now lie on it that the study will be carried out rapidly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV .
now , since the Pr@@ EP test medicine has been raised , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hod@@ g@@ son , Sh@@ adows Minister of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is to be paid after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how transformed this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of this vital infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people that are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in the company .
life Living : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have changed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , decreased in 2014 by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne didn &apos;t packed their bags and sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I lived with my Ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I searched for something that was similar to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
I was in love with them and made a quote on this day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhau@@ led .
originally a one bedroom apartment with a sp@@ itted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add the storage space and a mezzanine to optimal the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my request , &quot; says it .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , who was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling wasn &apos;t large enough to place two rooms over@@ lap so that the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine that could stand on .
Er@@ fan had to think about how to solve the submission .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they had to over@@ lap each other , without that we had to die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t just a simple platform to build a simple platform but the steel that it had for the function above or below the right height . &quot;
this arrangement makes it possible to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine you can see a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays an role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor will be mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen you feel like a window in another room .
at the entrance it offers space for all stocks and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ our@@ ful noise , the beauty of the living room can exclu@@ de the kitchen , if it is not used .
foldable kitchens are not new .
the special feature of this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very important to push it if you push the door , very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ ing use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate agents will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they made it to enlarge the soil area and use high quality materials to use the room to create a luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and help others to create a emotional binder in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electric socket in the walls .
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be converted by a good design and increased square meters of something standard in something very reasonable .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers Fight for a 500 million US dollar property imperi@@ alist
two brothers are four decades after her Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a debate because of one of the largest real estate imper@@ ial Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its assets are to be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from our family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation occurs in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 properties collected more than half a billion dollars , collected , since the family has bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , since 1973 .
the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded there and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with their de@@ ceased father Colin - von Paul has described as &quot; chief operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is - about two thirds of the company &apos;s headquarters and Paul approximately one third .
a judicial report states that Colin property has acquired in the value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash proved to be pointed out for Paul as pro@@ stit@@ ching point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ ite in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday .
the brethren are strug@@ gling to fight against the existing business - where@@ Colin , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed , this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some owners .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to join the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage written that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides have been held at the law firm .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants , dairy bars and delic@@ acy shops in the late 1950 &apos;s , and in the early 1970s a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick bought .
they used the security to buy the coll@@ ing@@ wood property , opened in Colin the first je@@ ans of the family .
Colin says that he began West@@ co , when he was in the last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
Anna De L@@ ut@@ is says that she died and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hope , to ad@@ mit their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he would never wanted to land before the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is group , where Colin claims that mark was paid at the moment of the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
both Luke and Mark are , &quot; Paul &quot; says over the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made himself very returned , although he was a former AF@@ L member , and after a biography of Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of television stars in 2015 .
Fair@@ fax media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and its contact contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really cannot say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to compl@@ ain me and to draw our family name by the dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Father would not have been rolled out that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; he wrote Colin .
tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff plans to restri@@ ct media abst@@ in@@ ence to the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct information on President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a consistent course .
here is a piece of re@@ por@@ ters Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new chief of Staff of the White House , in his first working day with executive staff , he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps white house which he rep@@ airing himself : bad information , who has come into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence , because the president would make better decisions , when he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ ys diagnostic makes sense , but others have tried to count Tr@@ ump by using its media .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship goes back to television in decades - and now , where he is in the White House , its TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; if the tr@@ ump was off@@ ended due to un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places given to convince , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom under control , according to six former elec@@ toral union officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption has a ste@@ ady lob@@ ster . &quot;
al@@ right .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaign agents know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets could not contain more combust@@ ible material yet without their inter@@ ventions .
we will probably never know about the twe@@ ets that did not send Tr@@ ump .
when his staff had made it some times , trouble from him , then their efforts have been worth the effort .
but no one has it resol@@ utely prevent Tr@@ ump con@@ tro@@ se .
a part of the problem exists , that people in a white house , which places out of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by helping to present their own views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - entirely busy with this history - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ er , President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; recent and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press sections , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he is trying to recover from whence these are .
exactly that happened at the end of February when someone accused a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chairman of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a cluster of Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was ban@@ ished from Twitter , or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask members of Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tries to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective managers as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still continues to influence .
these distinctive factors make the wa@@ it@@ ry &apos;s mission very difficult .
master@@ ful cr@@ ush@@ ers get post by Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the ten@@ ders of the population will be able to worship and hopes .
the police were sent throughout Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the escape .
since the addresses of the requested sword crimin@@ als are not known , hin@@ ts from the population will be hop@@ ing and worship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from the winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience would have shown that many wing@@ vol@@ at@@ ile holiday destinations hide , it was called Europ@@ ol .
I compiled 21 postcards to selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website has been www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ell &apos;s website , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online y@@ ons could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a tr@@ ench and return to &apos; million@@ th Series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est owner of the West Mid@@ lands have tra@@ ded again with some horri@@ fied trav@@ ellers on war base , which have tra@@ ded one of the congregation , in order to return a field before their man@@ sions .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravans on a field outside the we@@ al@@ thy street of Soli@@ ds , which is called &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and a army of transport , after they had been thrown out only in May without turning out by a prison by the Council to prevent their accidents .
the tak@@ est group found a gap in the defense systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ ob@@ stru@@ cted to find a way .
the inhabitants lost the Council of Soli@@ ds , saying that it was easy to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous occup@@ ant said : &quot; they went on Monday evening after they were sent away from Bentley He@@ ath where they cast stones onto the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced by shame to implement the problem as being used with the problem when dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers were there in May , were moved and now returned .
more arrived last night , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to move with a long under@@ statement in order to protect their parks .
I live at the Stre@@ am@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my church tax if the Council can &apos;t stop this once . &quot;
a resident who would not be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we only have seen the last round of this trav@@ ellers , only to be spo@@ iled by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ s said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised bearing on the land beyond the Stre@@ am@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls together . we take the necessary legal steps to move it as fast as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our berry collection , it is very important that as many as many residents can report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior during the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we propose our case . &quot;
made of Birken@@ hof Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is built from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .
this is good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof with the time amb@@ ience of Oper@@ ator was lost until 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 overn@@ ights per year were lost and revenues by the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees who came into the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , what was a controversi@@ al discussion .
the city prevented the lodging of asylum seek@@ ers through the installation of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt Julian Oss@@ et@@ us defended the hotel site and said already by serious concerns on the house at that time .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with registered office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a volunte@@ er auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Man@@ al@@ b .
you are hot hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the previous Hotel Birken@@ hof , there are already a long time building container before entering the entrance , and when you enter the house , it is clear that extensive renovation work will be carried out .
the so@@ ils were torn , bl@@ ank@@ ets , partly dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
rooms are equipped with spacious showers , the input range is redesigned , the new window will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be close to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nicely &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer broke out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
they would not be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a elevated centre level , emphas@@ ises Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , would be further elabor@@ ated , Sch@@ erer further explained .
both groups , groups or business people are to feel at home in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ i and Tourism director Michael K@@ rau@@ se he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the shows of the town be covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of the investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer did not want to set up exactly .
just under a million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the external plants will also be brought forward to the front , that is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant , which is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia aff@@ air : U.S. special investig@@ ator sets a Grand Jury
in the Russia aff@@ air by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel recorded work in the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in appeal to the case with the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has widened its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the CN@@ N station reported that there is already first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ds in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have targeted specifically in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined if there were ab@@ orted between tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men are to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to the report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special cre@@ ator of Tr@@ ump personally put together into the center and looking for the demonstration , if the President ruled the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the aff@@ air . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys , it is to examine and decide whether the prosecution is to be charged .
Grand jur@@ ys are therefore called to count chambers .
mostly they will be switched on if it is bigger and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure is always closed behind closed doors .
the committee can also be turned on by the Prosecutor to download persons for the hearing of E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N station , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued to turn around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who participated in the meetings were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
Moreover , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps were also consultant and in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his early elections , Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday night in US television that the application show that Mu@@ eller would not be so@@ ber in his work , and that it should be necessary to act quickly .
however , it must not necessarily be called ev@@ it@@ ably that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey .
nevertheless , the committee of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in research and a new reason to concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the middle of the new dis@@ closure of the President on Thursday evening an address in West Virginia to present the Russia aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the topic give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that . &quot;
his special advisor to T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he knows nothing about the composition of a Grand Jury .
but these work usually work in the case , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House for@@ bid any measures that accelerated the work of the special order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair way accelerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey said three times that I won &apos;t be determined against the President .
you have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was written in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey has been fired .
because of this R@@ aus@@ wur@@ fs we had become dro@@ pping against Tr@@ ump , he wants to handic@@ apped the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to evaluate the investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under large pressure because of the investigation .
according to the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special medi@@ ator and his staff .
that triggered spec@@ ulations about that Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
unlike an independent special medi@@ ator of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air around the years later , Mu@@ eller has served a position in which he could be fired in theore@@ tically on behalf of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to preventing such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic trans@@ formers have taken place on Thursday , after which the special rates could not be released so easy .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg is based in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Arctic the gigantic ice@@ berg has lo@@ osed from the barely seven times of Berlin@@ s from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this was shared by the Zar@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the more than one trillion ton heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres of big col@@ oring work now to the north and probably will probably take two , three years until it is melted .
it is with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the biggest ice r@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent climate change has played a role in breaking down the ice , is un@@ clear according to research information .
however , since about 30 years , there has been a series of unusual coll@@ ision of ice @-@ har@@ ps in the region , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a factor .
according to many researchers , that could be inter@@ connected with global warming .
the col@@ oss col@@ oss continued to date a part from Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
so it continues to grow into the sea and is steadily increasing .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
north of this sh@@ ri@@ pen@@ ises was the balance of wax and break off some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is may be tro@@ dden there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it was a lot to say that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as currently .
Moreover , the ice plate under voltage and could be tro@@ dden down , if a piece of keys could be broken .
melt by Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as they s@@ lows on the water and pushed ice as much water as it is after the melting itself .
however , the loss of failure to handle that gl@@ ac@@ iers can be flowing directly into the sea and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a low degree , the British research project writes about the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to A@@ WI data , with almost 50 000 square kilometers , the fourth biggest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of Antar@@ c@@ tica .
on the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the open ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural line and is no direct connection to climate change , the ice plate now comes into a end@@ anger@@ ed position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most far retreat since the start of records , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists have been disp@@ uted whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will again grow again or in the long term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even if this researchers do not return to climate change this gigantic ice@@ berg will not decline to climate change , but in the past decades there are very many ice @-@ el@@ ions of Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
this long dial of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends toward South America .
according to data of the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ic@@ onic surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature was contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have passed by around three degrees in the past 50 years , thus nar@@ row@@ ed in the areas where the temperature at the fastest sti@@ ff .
CDU wants to charge our staff at the staff
because it is more difficult to occupy free space , calls for the CDU to assign more attractive to the employer .
only shortly before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag made 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees left their first working day .
the apprentices in the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
around 620 applications were recorded for this year .
nevertheless , the circle still lack staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .
currently there are 50 un@@ occupied positions at M@@ ett@@ mann district .
they are sought among other doctors and engineers , as well as the forces of the general administration .
the CDU wants to take place in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG as well as the management of management in the administration .
according to the desire of the parties &quot; the administration is intended to work out a concept for personality and personal development . &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term thre@@ ats , but future @-@ oriented candidate for applicants , is called it .
the overall concept should be oriented towards inside and exter@@ n@@ ally , concrete measures for trans@@ verse tasks and invol@@ ve an apprentic@@ eship offensive , require the CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that list@@ ens to a good approach .
for the circle did it to do with the personal problems , which was not known so .
other cities include good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the address is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees , disease or age @-@ conditi@@ onally from the service .
so highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , leader of the CDU , goes out with his party to the joint application .
he didn &apos;t have a long surprise at the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ ist surprise when he publicly exhibited the personnel covered in question and blo@@ om the rest of the parties .
people want all the possibilities to check out a outlet from the municipal workers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we come here not in short term to a satis@@ fying solution , the county management with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - a pet cost &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , the CDU , employees and officials tried to pay better , as it actually sees the tariff for public service .
the sal@@ aries are exactly mandatory , increases or more money only if you are in a higher level which are oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown increasingly in the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees will take care of the new Pro@@ st@@ itu@@ ary Protection Act .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , land council Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ Director Martin Richter a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the sound to NGO Mig@@ rants rescue
Italy has NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue to continue with new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German aid organization &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human tra@@ ders in a way which facilit@@ ated illegal immig@@ ration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express detailed presentations of the Italian nationality . Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can understand all the alleg@@ ations that are currently raised , after having collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October , monitored .
it is assumed that its occupation of infl@@ atable migrants will take on board which can be delivered directly from human tra@@ ders , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used to re@@ use the ships .
at least one such agreement was supposed to be held only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acqu@@ is@@ itions of the national@@ ist , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected to take over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other mot@@ ives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have aboard a Italian police officers who supervised their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue inserts have been made ready to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter stated on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessarily but acceptable , since they would have no &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign the Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ate Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti said that the number of migrants who came to Italy began in the last weeks , that the effort to strengthen the strengthening of Libyan coastline and co @-@ operation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further convers@@ ations with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ ad , Niger and Mali concerning measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
An@@ st@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ mer B@@ iker , the &quot; Berlin branch &quot; and two guest drivers met in W@@ enheim in the North Palat@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and S@@ ights .
for that three kindly requested guides available .
the accommodation at Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed observation points , partly on towers , from which one could look forward to the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the pre@@ occupied planes .
between there , there were again longer asc@@ ents , for which a long triumph@@ ant was rewarded .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the feast of the feast .
again the look@@ out spot to look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate An@@ st@@ ents .

after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had learned the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from the best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equipment for e @-@ sport
sitting the sport @-@ stars sitting in the future before computer consoles , instead of the wind and weather fight over the stadium to fight ?
fact : E @-@ Sport has long been a serious business to become an lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high places .
this also recognized the first German lig@@ ations that increasingly eng@@ age in this area .
in the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded a E @-@ Sports Department , and two professionals took for the FIFA &apos;s computer 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to in@@ spire all new target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure to asc@@ end on that train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Federation organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London to compete against the Gam@@ er of several clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also looks great potential in E @-@ sport .
the Ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now also provided an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; the real soccer club must be in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that the young people go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the temp@@ ting tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .

long ago , like in normal sport , Li@@ gen established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and by the Asian Poker E @-@ Sports is already part of the official programme .
but is there any kind of sport anyway ?
for many is the idea of the need .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ otic has dealt long with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competent and many biological and physical reactions show that you can find in classic sport , for example , increased heart rate , stress actions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
in addition , there is cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction ability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only be at the console but also exercise their body and battles on the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but still a problem : &quot; d@@ oping still looks more a theme . &quot;
controls are difficult in online games , and in the scene were missing the structures of classical sport .
the scientists have a positive impact on the E @-@ Sports show .
players are internationally on the way , this is like a large global family , as there are no intercultural Hem@@ or@@ ations .
a study of the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts a fast growth ahead of E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly for advertising , Spon@@ sor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales should be 130 million .
however , a little bit of 2.4 billion euros of football @-@ Bundesliga is true .
however , the E @-@ Sports is not far away from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , write the Del@@ o@@ itte @-@ Consult@@ ant .
International are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez is participating in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher invests in the e@@ sport bet@@ tan@@ ker Uni@@ kr@@ n .
even in Europe does a lot .
in an Norwegian school , E @-@ sport had been introduced as a class@@ room , says F@@ rob@@ otic .
in the Netherlands and France , the football first @-@ first liga @-@ trials are obliged , according to D@@ utt , an e @-@ sport section is obliged to set up .

only in nost@@ al@@ gia , and to clari@@ fy the old times , is no longer enough .
the tradition of the association will go to preserve the tradition of the association at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digit@@ ised world , &quot; believes that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t hold on it , that only when football remains in the football , as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter was convicted of suicide because of the lyrics by Conrad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because they encour@@ ages their friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind G@@ ers , and five years were subjected to prob@@ ation .
in June , Carter was convicted of the killing of Conrad Roy , who took the life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is innocent .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal .
she has been con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psych@@ ic illness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions brought Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the lawyer in the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no Reu@@ e shown . &quot;
but Car@@ ver At@@ tor@@ ney said , it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ st@@ ance , whom it is completely regre@@ t@@ less . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that her &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant effect on their actions . &quot;
a state prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who bes@@ ity that there is no day in which I don &apos;t hurt the loss of my beloved son .
I would like that he is proud of me and how I go with all . I try , despite all my pain we will bear for eternity , for his sisters , &quot; says it in it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they will never be prosec@@ uted by the knowledge &quot; I will never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this only person to have together with which I had been together since my birth one day , is a pain that I will always keep my life for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to set a right precision in Massachusetts , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime against any other , committed suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in the year 2014 of a carbon mon@@ oxide po@@ is@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case moved national attention to himself after Car@@ ters Text@@ noti@@ fications that she encour@@ ages him to termin@@ ate his life .
&quot; hands on , spring of a building , first eche yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she was sent to his death during the two weeks before his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all that you must do is to switch the generator and be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit through any press from the case .
the case has dealt the legal opinion .
one of the few that Carter defended , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted of her British Mit@@ t in Italy in 2007 , was acquitted before two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as captain of the Audi Cup , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ ams the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season with extra motivation .
something was otherwise on his place in the cabin , that looked at Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the extra piece is very small , very small .
but as far as wide and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups there was no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel New to see , he made him immediately after his arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the one could have better run than 0 : 2 to the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also suggest K@@ imm@@ ich .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was not elected as a player leader in youth musicians , who has been chosen as a play@@ guide , but he was chosen .
sugar is spread to those who want to have a lot to keep those who want to keep in La@@ une .
so those who have been chosen to compete the heritage of Lah@@ m , can only use a small extra motivation .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to do as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was considered a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right behind , that is now his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did their rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich had worked in this position like the one who can take the ru@@ der on the best in hand .
he gave instructions to pick up the un@@ finished troops .
he had the sight for all , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vid@@ al thus trying to play his missing fitness ( hing@@ ed ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus come to the Devil &apos;s achievements ( also only conditi@@ onally dependent ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le hence , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ als .
it all works fine .
Sü@@ le started beside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the brig@@ ade , both ag@@ ated so@@ vereign .
the nam@@ ing occupied Nap@@ oli storm often did very difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried again in playing a few times .
his colleague Rud@@ y announced that the result was &quot; not so , as we have hop@@ ed for us . &quot;
but he showed an ordinary performance at the debut .
game re@@ location , speed change : &quot; for this style I was also taken . &quot;
how usual this Bayern @-@ world is still for the new length , you saw in the connection to the game .
Rud@@ y for example was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed away after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new players .
there he heard of sweet@@ ly a interesting set : &quot; what here goes , I have already noticed now .
you simply have to win any game in Bavaria . &quot;
after all , he must not bring the new one more .

it is often un@@ reconc@@ iling , the relationship between the country and regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Grün@@ e ) , nor the Minister of Economics of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows more than one year , in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .

Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of commerce and industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims to increase the wine industry &apos;s Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase the sales in supermarkets and the trend of the German Wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ uses an open ear for people who want to establish its own company , the I@@ HK .

there is a premium of 1000 Euro for the covered master check and 2500 euros if graduates within ten years after the master@@ ing training .

Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers have faced with a counter@@ reaction
a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would be able to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said that &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; it is intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus it went to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located to offer or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday , that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European autom@@ akers have benef@@ ited the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines are em@@ itted , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of car manufacturers , to be installed for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles , will also take up what it is difficult to keep the prize of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indicted to ignore the mighty automobile companies and to ignore the problem of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called auto @-@ devices that could regul@@ ate emissions if a car was tested , but for normal driving conditions .
several employees were accused of Volkswagen in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put into judgment in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investig@@ ative investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities were accused to have a system installed to deal with emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focuses on the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could affect Volkswagen hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in spring much less rain , and in autumn much more .
this has impact on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , transm@@ its the d@@ warf @-@ ca@@ des , and in very dry conditions there are very many of them . &quot;

Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; rather than long vegetable watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or missing .

the killing of a journalist under@@ scores the growing thre@@ ats in Mexico
the staff of weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce is usually taken on Wedn@@ esdays to review their plans for the most recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa through the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and ir@@ resist@@ ible drug wars .
but in that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what saf@@ er feel : they should take their children with the office , who were the goal of a attack with gran@@ ulates in 2009 , or they will be at home .
security experts have three words written on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ por@@ ters to propose a name for any column - no evidence is necessary , tru@@ sts and abdom@@ inal feel .
there are drug tast@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the for@@ bid list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that dangerous the chaos of Mexico .
there is no resting period of violence , and during all the country the bodies of bodies , there are more journalists : at least 25 , since then President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto have surrendered to attacks and thre@@ ats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and its inspir@@ ator by Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mist@@ akes is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence will be deeply impressed , although its presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , that shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , which show his ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous face with glasses or typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porter discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , her night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although it was established in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists , under the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists only two criminal procedure was initiated .
as with the thousands of Mor@@ den , each year with drug trading and organic crimes are linked , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will only be diagnosed in court .
in Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and even though the terrain is still missing .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without righteousness , the meeting on discussion of safety is a little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stup@@ id to turn my time in this workshop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while we do not know why , Mis@@ sing we all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was taken by two men . it was taken out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the cap drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing as silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in January and the extra@@ dition of the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa became one of the most bloody batt@@ lefield of the country since the rival fac@@ tions strug@@ gling here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ al@@ oa every day someone can be shot or several people on the streets , or that the cemetery is full of consumed , two @-@ storey Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug who are bigger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only one cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the fault that he couldn &apos;t protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
first published in February the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of the riv@@ alis@@ ing cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may be off@@ ended with the children , the gang@@ sters bought each copy of the edition , as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ k .
the second error was in it , Val@@ dez not to force , after conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country in his own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues draw , that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 USD hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without having regard to the noise po@@ ison &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the time , the newspaper served a reputation for the cour@@ age@@ ous and hon@@ our@@ able coverage , and the turnover and advertising took .
re@@ por@@ ters , hard @-@ faithful investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication that they could read stories , nobody else could treat them .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where they also led them .
he gave up voluntarily to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the time of the CP@@ J . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug dealers in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV .
&quot; you need to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not like to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done so many dead ... why did you not tell what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team is Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could curse the fun , the gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and coun@@ sels , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he always would bear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sitting at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also forced them to ask their own interests in question , how they can do their work on the best and still in life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and landing run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ education and self @-@ keeping .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ers .
when it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell a sense that can be disappointed ... and then the thing is happening with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and other states , do not apply mut@@ al@@ oa as well as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , where a po@@ ison@@ ous blend of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ es , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room in which the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , suddenly there were no mobile phones . days earlier , Spyware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside they sought two police protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who commit himself as a tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the re@@ porter have passed into the mountain scenery , where the drug are fac@@ to under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blocked three main stories .
there were the assassination of the former famous Box@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , which concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the state @-@ old , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about it , who was kidn@@ apped , or how it happened , so be careful , as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug tra@@ ders and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant under the name of a policy was registered , which was part of the Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , which nearly all political levels ruled throughout the century .
several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the re@@ porter , about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was escaped from a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months before , readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best inform@@ al source via the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not know what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its slim body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the Office of Val@@ dez was devoted to the storage room for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff had become something that they never expect : activ@@ ist in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez lam@@ inated a few signs and entered the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the office of the State Court .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the Western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the country , journalists had become stronger than they have written in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tried to gather international support for the justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
with a meeting with the Govern@@ or of Sin@@ al@@ oa , on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to bring journalists and bring them to them , because they have said the truth .
she has since then asked that she is once divided by the government , because they wor@@ ried that their rage has hurt its obj@@ ec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organis@@ er crimes committed to government officials and a DC current society . &quot;

apparently , the mur@@ ders have an ab@@ hor@@ red effect .
no one forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ ish Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones were next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern state of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others are going on how it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed to the drug board with a leading article on the introduction &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is difficult to find work in exile and still observe the streets and search for d@@ angers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , as evi@@ den@@ ced the photographer of Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in a flat in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky rights .

at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already completed , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat before the office and drank beer , when all of their phones began to sum@@ med up .
a number of shooting paintings with band@@ en@@ ri@@ val@@ en and security forces near the seaside Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ ios@@ ities you have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the introduction page was to be changed on the next day .
sy@@ r@@ ens he@@ els close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the polic@@ emen who stayed guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the huge part of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ al@@ oa , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you think it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was murdered on the same day , at the Javier , the intern was asked for me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used Tar@@ ot to sof@@ ten his enemies
at the first glance , it looks like a statue , if also an overwhelming .
now researchers found that the first in@@ sights of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his shoe skin was red@@ dish Braun - and they said they had something from a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report written in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; held ro@@ amed din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ ossil is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved state has researchers to describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the mo@@ red plant fres@@ ser is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , pit .
he met something of the surrounding rock off on the Plat@@ o , and decided to see more precisely .
the F@@ ossil discovered by him in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you fl@@ ashing a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it was hat@@ ched , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will go in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers found out that this plant is fres@@ cos , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , probably from flesh vor@@ ce din@@ osau@@ rs was threatened .
the powerful Din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage used to hide and used a sky@@ line that is known as counter@@ f@@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to blend better in its surroundings and to prevent their enemies , experts predi@@ ct that there was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal , and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the constellation , a widespread defense method in the animal , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the allocation is usual , the results are sur@@ pris@@ ingly , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds that of today the living animals exceeds today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were ch@@ ased out of sufficient pressure through the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , the evolution of con@@ front@@ ation of con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the past@@ ry sh@@ ady - are much smaller and viol@@ ate as a prey , which signal that this No@@ dos@@ sier was a real battle for survival .
&quot; strong pir@@ ated behavior on a massive , strongly covered din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs smo@@ kes of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous have to have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red .
scientists continue to examine the animal on his life , including his preserved performer in order to find out what it did as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , came into a river , and cast into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea .
at that time Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far@@ ther than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ si@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ voy skin , but also in three dimensions , and the original shape of the beast , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal looks like today as in the early chal@@ k period .
they don &apos;t need much imagination to re@@ constru@@ ct it . if you only have a little with the eyes Sch@@ iel@@ en , you could almost believe that he is in sleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous time was a time when an enormous thermal em@@ itting , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the earth went through .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the pan@@ eled din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out of some of his fur@@ y ancest@@ ry .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , their latest in@@ sights in the journal Current Biology show , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was dra@@ fted after the death in the sea and in the mud were m@@ um@@ bled .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn radio when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , pit .
according to the museum , it is the fun@@ eral din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete by the mu@@ zzle to the hi@@ ps .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips used by his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ ze@@ es was forced through the Western Canada until the floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater head of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the hood are still rather woo@@ ded tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs .
like Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , such as is the level of conservation so &apos; sel@@ dom such as a profit in lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
brown rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the hol@@ den tank plates that wear the skull of the animal .
his right face is on his side , his five fingers are split up .
I can count the scales at its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass amb@@ ass@@ age on A8 : many injured
severe accident on Thursday night on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ l@@ ol@@ age .
there are many injured , kil@@ owatt @-@ long st@@ resses and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) on the late morning of Thursday , 20 people were injured during a mass ar@@ l@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
according to the police , the police were at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the connecting places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm nearly 30 vehicles , including probably lor@@ ries .
more information about the exact number of the latter stood at first .
it ret@@ ains mild to moderate serious injuries , a poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher said .
a big dec@@ or to rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
a ten kilometres long retreat in the direction of Munich was formed .
like a AZ @-@ re@@ porter , there came also on the counter@@ run@@ way to massive disability - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade took up the label of the vehicle handle@@ bars , which now have to count with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 hrs there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once again : nothing else sits in the train and sleeps .
or man is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingen@@ ious thoughts .
and then : buff@@ f .
when he comes and swal@@ lowed up an in@@ sist@@ ence or cra@@ cking the lift in the midst of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently test@@ i@@ fies the seamless travel card control .
it is simply confirmed by the mobile phone that it is taken place and evalu@@ ates the ticket to the ticket .
currently a test operation runs on two distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is available , we expect it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available early next year on many other district trains in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is called by train the chassis of cards without Schaff@@ ner .
however , in order to be able to use the requirements , some conditions have to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what do you do most passengers already .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , what is the most convenient type of ticket booking .
and at least one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is : one gets to the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers a button appears on the electronic determination .
the train atten@@ dant will receive a message that passenger X is located in the train and has taken the booked seat Y Y .
the train atten@@ dant comes to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already valuable online ticket .
so you can sleep and continue to continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - what is supposed to take advantage of the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; who would like to travel without ticket control by our train atten@@ dant , check in the DB Navigator just yourself .
this allows passengers to design their travel time in Zug , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB remote traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often train leaves , knows that next to delay and missed boo@@ ths belong to the biggest doctors .
because often , in any case , one of the not all documents do not require any documentation that you need for the recovery of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or a document that you need to refer to .
the result are endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to worse mood in the section or greater space and del@@ ays with their own tickets and workers at the end of the time to take care of others .
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further access numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked .
how a activ@@ ist came to study the answer to question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken by their core .
only one day after they arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was named there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ used , since no one had post@@ pon@@ ed the information on its feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ the@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly ret@@ aining its tim@@ eline .
the R@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officers in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed , live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was on the road and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought of himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was not new for them and their community .
it took her mobile phone to return later on the evening on Twe@@ ets on people on Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos from the police band and people , the cried , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father , who gave a sign with the inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed at which a police station stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with an in@@ verteb@@ rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another police is his crying and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered their statement .
&quot; that is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and we can be called . &quot;
at this moment , I was feeling cont@@ actor .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a history of over@@ life and the protest , the love and the loss of strength , strength and resistance , which are made up of the point of people living in the community and the streets are filled to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l was with her daughter , who brought a flower dress and a matching crown , after Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , that they had countless times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remembered you , as I taught you when black people have to fight for that of what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it has to know and to see it in it .
it must be well developed , not only active and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to free yourself .
even if I experienced good luck you have experienced an experience in which they personally experienced non @-@ ek@@ an@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep them far off . &quot;
the first station , when she arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp as the activists on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there are Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter connected with a local company owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and hal@@ ved them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to take a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m for fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed completely after 9 August totally , &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ course Association and focused on essence of justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come everything . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met in an evening demonstration of Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r would only want to document , &quot; what happened .
a question was Fer@@ rel@@ l in the meaning : &quot; want to document or try to find a story that you can ut@@ ili@@ ze ? &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white , in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an explained recently in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices have not been cent@@ ered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ ct @-@ occup@@ ants .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l the project closer , along with six other native musicians followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are depicted , for so I will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that there is in motion &quot; not around a Messiah guide , but around a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
according to what are documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life , how she loves and marry her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that it has to give a certain amount of injuries for this work and the de@@ composition of a black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black pregnant women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves .
two of the three fo@@ unders of movement , who have marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Martin in 2012 .
&quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we fight in different fron@@ ts .
black , pregnant women have to wear the main load of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to note that &quot; the movement truly kept the movement of black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a dramatic type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was chosen by fer@@ rel@@ l because of their identity as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who opened this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , although she was at the front front , because in a life at these cross@@ ings than a black , pregnant woman is so much on the game .
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the message cameras in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
yet they cl@@ ed to a voc@@ als and she feels complete this memory , since she left for three years ago in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss about Bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although they were not built long ago .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the South &apos;s pedestrian zone has since the first presentation in 2009 the population in Be@@ ing and opponents .
the topic is hardly any one .
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the subject is discussed .
while the one @-@ bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This would be a real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ mann ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ aking ) or quite simple : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
during the fears that a gallery has more customers to the city , of which the other business also benefit , fear the ad@@ versaries , that then the pedestrian zone ble@@ ed .
in addition , the gallery is planned to be found on the property on which the pe@@ asant market stands in which 13 directors are mark@@ eted .
the construction work is finished with the start of construction .
the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and there is a place for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with a possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been selling almost weekly in the pe@@ asant market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the land are very happy .
the but@@ chers are also discovered for us .
we would like to announce that , while and especially after the building of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market is mark@@ eted in the gallery , arrives at the height of the rent .
this is likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what was shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ ill@@ ers or supermarkets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous .
of which there are enough in our city .
one can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but there is not even an ordinary weekly market here , it is the more important that we have received at least the Mark@@ thalle .
because after all , the goods offered is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer , and is not an endless .
as you see , shop shops are rented in a shopping mall just by larger firms , because the holiday rentals are often not portable .
too bad , special transactions there is almost no longer and what is left , then will van@@ ish even disappear . &quot;
Wolf Tra@@ ff@@ icking : &quot; a shopping mall with a Mark@@ thalle suits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the pe@@ asant market place during the construction time ?
the old ED@@ EK@@ A would be the solution - even in length if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or creates it the bit @-@ bit gallery before , to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not work .
and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
my view would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant market , it is possible thanks to the mad of many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more .
when the pe@@ asant market is set , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which hang almost un@@ notic@@ e@@ ably - those on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ ils and Haar@@ utt@@ ons created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the ex@@ cer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analysis operates in a 35 @-@ year sentence after she publicly made diplomatic information about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August , A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg who joined their specialist expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a mission and ground@@ breaking disc@@ sid@@ y , whose condem@@ nation had been converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created a sharp analysis of the DNA that could extract from Mann@@ ing , and out of the 30 portraits , such as anyone can be interpreted with this gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many wise men can be interpreted as they can be interpreted and the in@@ firm@@ ament determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been spoken openly concerning the identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges , including six violations of the Spy law , computer and theft .
by the prison the picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one picture - a gra@@ b , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , sitting in the man@@ ing is clearly visible on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ ter onde was associated with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of its 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of strange arti@@ facts such as cigarette st@@ ems and chew@@ ing gum by removing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of it , like those people might look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it could not be visited at that time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and its in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were made to un@@ ite Bri@@ eff@@ el who ruled several letters in the course of two years .
she even created a question of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ression Images , &quot; which would be a future predicted in which the President Chel@@ y@@ ell would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing , after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome sort of fortun@@ ate meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit depth and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads an war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ eter results in order to escape the rigid metal circuits , which he should actually fix to escape .
as a De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic shred@@ der , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg trusted , by the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ on of the artist ) to show how amazing , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people think that our gen@@ ome is not concerned , who we are and how are genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , trace Mem@@ ories , too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a separate room is one side from the above mentioned com@@ ic Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it appears with a free spins in the hands of the United States of the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she was ch@@ ill your words , then they have won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so I never eat the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets the Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m still looking ge@@ view , if I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predic@@ tive in the com@@ ic book - but if it should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room of m@@ asks , by their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation , which is like Hor@@ ses of Protest@@ ants .
that was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , which were written with a pencil , with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a man &apos;s man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg by the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that even behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
University of North@@ western and a employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide human @-@ hunt is a professor at North@@ western University and a staff of the University of Oxford which had been sought to susp@@ ect a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with dead@@ ly injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts issued an arrest warrant for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as outlined the acts of the Local Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several bul@@ lets died .
a community warning system published by Chicago &apos;s police authority states that Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27th .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the sacrifice with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the site of the events for a dead , and det@@ ectives the Sti@@ che as a murder while the police actively campa@@ igned after the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was now in ur@@ lau@@ ght and to join the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter that is examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one spokes@@ man at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail address that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in contact with the police in contact and ready to help us to help us the U.S. investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to shock it .
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he demanded the susp@@ ect of susp@@ ect the susp@@ ect .
&quot; the police has a presentation of her position , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities will help you find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police got a call from the building site of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip that has just happened in apartment 1008 .
the police described the scene as a very fierce .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was not clear if the incident happened on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement on the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the O@@ pf@@ ers and sear@@ ches a variety of mot@@ ives , including a possible case . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map into the near future , &quot; - Russian vice @-@ runner Mut@@ ko
Russian vic@@ t@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) can be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ filling the criteria of the road@@ map R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and testing in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA driver was updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the recovery of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything , what could happen to Russia on occasion .
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results are presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the List , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities have approved the outcome of the WA@@ DA German anti @-@ d@@ oping officials to publicly accept d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system had an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programmes , and we will not give something , what does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os &apos;s words were voted by Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the Head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point of R@@ sports at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v was asked problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have said to repeat that the report has disp@@ uted positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ conditi@@ onally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als by WA@@ DA from the execution of D@@ oping control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping control ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the organisation of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves into the right direction . &quot;
Al@@ di hasn &apos;t been sold any eggs more
we distributed its corporate groups .
it is a pure precau@@ tion , so it could continue to be assumed by no health impair@@ ment , it was called in the notification .
from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been tested negative on fi@@ ber@@ ized anti @-@ noise properties .
Al@@ di would produce clarity and transparency about its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ age , little helpful or - even worse - fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not mourn .
&quot; there was just never consistency and obj@@ ec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Re@@ ed .
she sum@@ mon@@ ed people from the outside .
a new race of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel at home .
by creating and licens@@ ing of software that allows the specific purpose of the employee &apos;s commitment , it allows companies to conduct surveys speci@@ alities and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to handle the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employee commitment .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel it in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ map of the company that have at a glance , which units have the most complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives must have low state results - so that you can re@@ drill .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so you do not have the next user@@ names , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , which has been a former collabor@@ ator that has been spoken in sc@@ and@@ als , who have spoken a environment of har@@ ass@@ ments , where those who have spoken is punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish for an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18,@@ 7 billion value , according to the finance technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent the bad behavior , and saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
converting has nearly 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
how G@@ lin@@ t , lets you send personal@@ ized &quot; Pul@@ se &quot; to collect confi@@ dential answers in real time and view the warmth cards of your problem .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that can report with the staff of bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regulations , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
when a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers @-@ flu@@ ence and complaints , &quot; Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has Conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures , and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a employee would have to report a problem , he had to submit or she had an telephone number or email for the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken serious .
it was often an en@@ rol@@ ment and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees .
now , since the company requires converting , problems , the previously prepared by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ lau@@ re@@ ty practitioners can be identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can come closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Vit@@ rano that leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in the employment of employment . &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Employ@@ ees in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen broke out because of ethnic origin through the En@@ ron Sk@@ and@@ al , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took up until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the company knew that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; said he .
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and keys the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors that have both start @-@ ups .
the Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , where the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ern secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature by companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research , which shows that the present staff of its job sets more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are glad to feel in a company that it is worth , and that the work that you do is worth , then they feel more strongly committed to this company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and W@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is used both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors can reach R@@ end@@ ites when their portfolio companies are well run . companies run good if employees are involved and engaged .
if the Analytics tools are third to talk , commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the employee engagement according to experts of workplace culture important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of an enterprise do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have anticip@@ ation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or at all , this can dis@@ appoint@@ ments dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees .
&quot; if you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen himself too much for collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of this ?
and who does not take care of it , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who is now through monthly employee surveys , was able to initi@@ ate action on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after the feedback from the feedback of fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize and organize multiple teams within the company and to add an communications training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new in@@ sights about the staff , and it hopes that on long sight , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector which is known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you lose customers also .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A @-@ Foot@@ ball@@ players on one side of the new exercise fields of the teams are talking on the campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of silence from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break in minutes .
players who are written down to the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return at 6 : 30 a.m. on the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ ina , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a short before the Monday to Tuesday .
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully packed tim@@ est@@ ates of the player .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood moved back to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school during Mor@@ as six times in West wood .
they will hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 . 20 before commen@@ cement of the formal gaming preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that it support the rules of the N@@ CAA support even if they add to the most busy routes of the player another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this tremendous load three or four days on it , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pressed them , they pl@@ uck up , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think when we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will termin@@ ate their practices as soon as the camp is terminated , as soon as the camp is terminated , which has been exposed to a hotel of elevated class , which is already available with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective net behind a door post , no easy task .
Bru@@ ins player will occupy the hotel over this weekend but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; that is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people can rent there a room , and then set it on it to record a exercise .
if you have a video and exercise , it is quite a good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t want to worry about too big wor@@ ries .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against f@@ ake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ seh@@ ood of third parties and their results under the original contribution , this is the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight against f@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect possible fal@@ seh@@ ood , and they may be shown at factor check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ized as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called f@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believe that they also affects the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem is also become a great political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were floo@@ ded in May with wrong stories , and Germany also supports a plan , after the social media networks , if it is not possible to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook told us in a separate declaration in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts will be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to the knowledge that stories from fac@@ ial survi@@ ving third parties , want to meet people more context to meet what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sarah Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; link below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to other changes in his news feed to reduce wrong news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
create a Com@@ ic novel : a Castle in the History of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze @-@ music video and was a s@@ qui@@ l hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his cozy seat at the F@@ ent River Valley in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of som@@ eb@@ ody who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says he we@@ ary .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed the time from the Middle Ages to the era of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , coming British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he un@@ expect@@ edly found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acts on the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double bed in the 1700 @-@ year @-@ old , which he worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
and they smell like smoke , because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light .
for someone who lives for 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as he himself would also be .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so with old pap@@ ering is that he has been assisted by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months lived in a castle ( &quot; To be hon@@ est , I &apos;ve got a little over a little over &quot; ) that seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days that the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; Castle spent to study the archives and to study many treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , as they had spent the mounted Hy@@ en@@ ches on walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .
he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with rural conservation , gre@@ ens and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was only given the full access in 2006 when the last harvest , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employee began to take care of the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years in which arist@@ oc@@ rates said &quot; Oh , un@@ lock it on the attic . &quot;
diary , letters from the time of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , which could say : &quot; you could mean that country @-@ fle@@ es would be bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all its course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection are using the castle as the starting point to come on a wider basis in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; which leaves the newly built castle in order to join the pe@@ asant status of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar , who entered the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the pe@@ asant rose up in this area and I thought , a insur@@ rection was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , telling the story of the Jesu@@ it patented , the family of Dar@@ rel@@ l was hidden for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers &apos; in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is represented in the 18th century by completing his own fun@@ eral by completing a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery which was only excav@@ ated only years later ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lem@@ an is appropriate g@@ aun@@ er to be more debt and money for things that they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men cr@@ ates their debt cr@@ ises by being rich women &apos;s women - I present them as a well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to get a land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des in search of other unique cry experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic @-@ novel about Als@@ ace @-@ Po@@ ki behind him , the territory of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has been re@@ called again by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Christmas chapel covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the cover of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Marien@@ kap@@ elle , in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started her campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team will keep the logo and the slogan .
by the end of August it is supposed to be the highlight of the campaign a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; the makers of the promotion has been on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel since yesterday .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday &apos;s website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that it seems better than it seems .
basically we are the firm persu@@ asion that we know as a bath Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens around the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
with the action there is more than &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is called on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a stand@@ able promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , in the competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ digit amount , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fears of the Army
every year in the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es retirement age and transports in the officer of officer .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine at Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the presi@@ dency of the government , the five Deputy Prime Minister , as well as the Minister for Defence , In@@ ner@@ es , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
that were the civilians in Y@@ as in the number .
the government moves on the military to the military .
Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ure of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed .
since the failed coup , head of head of state Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army , mostly because of alleged connections on the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire of the coup .
around 486 people who have been involved in the coup attempt to have been involved in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an was named as &quot; Wor@@ ship &quot; of the Wor@@ ds , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to make the armed forces &quot; to be fully clean . &quot;
but did Erd@@ og@@ an really in the handle ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ known in the Military @-@ headquarters . &quot;
in the general Staff , there is a concern because of an increasing &quot; islam@@ ic &quot; of the army , which manifest itself among others in the repe@@ al of the head @-@ verb@@ ots for sol@@ ete , the newspaper wrote .
the grand@@ parents in the army and security forces continues in any case .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an sent further 73@@ 95 state services , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed like Erd@@ og@@ an the military .
gener@@ als earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they killed them under calling on her role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly state rules .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an entered the power of the military step by step , not least under calling for the reform of the European Union .
former officer , Erd@@ og@@ an , is pro@@ gres@@ sing specifically for an Islam@@ zation of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; a well @-@ called officer , who sought refuge from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in few years &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
NATO meets this , could not leave it cold .
now , there is no doubt in the alliance to the pur@@ ge of the Turkish army .
the managers and operations capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; they say Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington change the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the Media .
he looks back to lower the legal immig@@ rants on 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter requirements for issu@@ ing visa for a temporary working permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is supposed to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and will save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the United States to change the way how citizens from other countries are called Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to the candidate , who have the financial assets to support ourselves and knowledge that will show the financial assets , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media .
ministry wants to san@@ itation way for racing traffic
again , in the past months more than the future of the race of the race track have been disp@@ uted - now it should be quickly going fast .
before the end of the year , the route is to be built on which the tourist railway station will be built .
to secure the future of the race of the race @-@ long term , according to the information of the public Ministry , construction work is scheduled to start in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order the route of Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g and to san@@ itation , the country knows especially for the tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route he was reduced to approximately 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country exceeded 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the country , will be defin@@ iti@@ vely matched , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the southern lat@@ itude as the operator shall have the technical details already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the ti@@ met@@ able , used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this is to be ordered by the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is especially popular with tourists popular train connection between Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g train stations .
over the last months in the course of a pilot plant , the route has been used by plenty of people to order it again in the future .
the route is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the Asc@@ ent of Sex Ro@@ bots is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought it can not be mad in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots can be found .
yes , indeed .
sex robot is currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their rise .
customers can choose the eyel@@ et of the robot , its form of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people are funny , but the company deliver lots of these things , and we are still going to see it much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin , which feels warm - with deliber@@ ately human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can custom@@ ize his robot according to its belie@@ fs &quot; and can choose everything , from the eye color of the robot via the form of chest pain up to type or the colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it &apos;s still wor@@ r@@ ying , as many robots have the &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; who would look like a step@@ ford @-@ woman from progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the real bot@@ ix robot makes it possible for example his users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appe@@ aling as for example .
and then , the True Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold robots with pre @-@ programmed personal@@ ities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of ti@@ red@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of true Compan@@ ion .
so you like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her voting - all as real people !
it can be we@@ ary to be fixed , or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects in this ascent of sex rob@@ otic - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the sub@@ di@@ ctions on rape , if you get a step on fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resi@@ den@@ ial ) Far@@ rah is in@@ tran@@ qui@@ eted most of the most .
on his site , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with an vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator why do men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it on the site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this sex robot does not only have a fat or content just another sex@@ tet .
their emergence and their increasing refin@@ ement indicate a bit dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the Ideal of Gender Equality to a wish after having sex with an optional allowance .
most men of course do not stop sex robots , while the FR@@ R noticed their rising popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what originates from the mar@@ g@@ inal zones , can be taught in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not strange or ob@@ sc@@ ei@@ ving until the free market is available for this purpose .
there is a certain end@@ ure that these high @-@ developed sex robots occur in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House , who has ins@@ ulated them sexually attacked .
the terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Cra@@ cow &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the worn @-@ out body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind this sex rob@@ otic system consists of it , a physical simil@@ arity to actual women so realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their builder want to feel themselves , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point if it is about their &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; , the robot does not represent real women .
they can not separate from their companion or simply go away .
they don &apos;t have a medi@@ ation or background history , nothing , which indicates in@@ depen@@ dency or anything , which could distur@@ b your imagination tot@@ ality .
other words : they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in speech by 2017 : ma@@ ids
tr@@ um@@ ps great achievement ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the expression of healthy human lives
it is become a Bin@@ sen@@ we@@ ish@@ eit of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political sp@@ elling that have polar@@ ised the US voters also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ ow there were newspapers in the USA newspapers , how to deal with the hor@@ ror of tr@@ ump @-@ selectable relatives .
we t@@ oss all supp@@ os@@ edly in order to burst out our filter bub@@ bles .
less not@@ orious is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , an left @-@ oriented sealing in Chicago , has long been living in Chicago for a long time with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family to visit me this week in New York .
it rec@@ alled me that the unit can have a powerful enemy against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can kind@@ red , with which she fought in decades because of the politics , suddenly and very strange on the same site .
in order to be the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further link that this also brings significant risks with themselves .
the Left was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gra@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility of getting us no longer a day .
however , there is still a long @-@ distance long @-@ time scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alised , &quot; which suddenly appeared in comparison to its standards suddenly as in@@ compreh@@ en@@ ness of deteri@@ oration .
I find me today from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney ur@@ com@@ ic version of the tra@@ verse - the dog on the car , the 14 % income tax ( but at least did we know how its tax returns ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact appear as a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
if Tr@@ ump is , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be healthy healthy in order to qualify as an indisp@@ ens@@ able improvement .
when my cou@@ sine was in the city , we brought our children to car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ers of New York park , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you are no caffeine needed .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ush@@ y and the animals are turning to look full of their own shoul@@ ders - extremely dark and climate brigh@@ ter music convey@@ s this to strange fashion .
so many cl@@ ams of a city are dis@@ counted : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are familiar to offer a lot of exc@@ itement , and the reality of the city shall not be justified .
five and thirty years later , and I &apos;m still not over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange experience , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s to go on it and all have a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately there was no man asked about it .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions in a scale of 5 to five stars before I could draw my credit card .
in a coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to compens@@ ate with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral dialogue , but does not work pressure on the server to enter your personality in a situation in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store was de@@ pri@@ ved , while I tired the experience made my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for the second time in the prison camp for the second time .
last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of mu@@ ff@@ les to the hospital , which he suffered the prison authorities after a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to death in murder because of murder and prosec@@ uting the prosec@@ ut@@ ors of prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys for murder .
he killed Ste@@ e@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s early morning by taking it several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on it .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a n@@ igh@@ tly penetration , who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , who they say they are to be op@@ aque .
the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that they will raise the appeal at the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us running danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

software update for diesel vehicles : what does the data subject now need to know
how exactly will the software update instead ?
do you have to participate in the action ?
the main questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and to some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse than are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe comments ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the negoti@@ ated software updates are voluntarily .
&quot; the previously oblig@@ atory updates are only valid for vehicles that in Schumann software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin .
its re@@ arm@@ ament has ordered the power station Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturer announced a fast implementation in the next few months , but not called an exact date .
Daimler has informed , every person concerned .
if you are due to inspection a inspection , this will be done within the frame .
how long will the change of change go in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; writes S@@ met@@ anin .
the curtains from the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntarily on the subject of environmental manufacturers to date so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the dis@@ arm@@ ament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time w@@ ells could be to get an appointment .
what do motor@@ ists do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE to wait .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would go down , S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price reduction of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE does not fear .
but in the regions where elev@@ ations are dro@@ pping .
in rural areas there are no impair@@ ment losses for older diesel .
the ACE does not have to wait for sale .

we make the city li@@ ve@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ master , goes to R@@ ente in the coming year .
however , the place is already written - suitable applicants are ra@@ r .
for 31 years W@@ acker is Stadt@@ bau@@ at@@ master .
and the work makes it still big fun , as he is convey@@ ed in the press conference .
he reports exciting , but even demanding tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time ad@@ mi@@ red it , so far , no application to fulfill the requirements .
the town is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the same time .
so - considering the cont@@ emp@@ t of the regular period of notice - enough time for el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach was appointed to the administrative community as a sub@@ sid@@ y authority , the candidate must submit corresponding financial statements .
for this function wants to keep the city on any case .
if they do not have to fill this no more , citizens would have to go to Offen@@ burg .
but civil proximity should be the city and himself important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good company lim@@ a , as well as good mood between the authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office there are some important projects accumulated , looking back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make life eternal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is about the building office and his staff safe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ Park Square are located approximately .
the kin@@ da bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , the stadium is still subject to the theme .
the latter alone will hit the be@@ ech with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we really do it , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; everything in all wait great tasks on my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design shapes be present for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master of large games room .
Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own farm and gar@@ dener could be highly flexible in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is as a monument under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have it , &quot; if new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the leaving Stadt@@ bau@@ master .
it carries high responsibility in the Stadt@@ bau@@ master .
he is builder , &quot; at the end everything goes on my table . &quot;
for assistance and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in existence for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep building ) has been in existence since 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even that his successor is long , W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if Roland W@@ acker would like to inherit Roland W@@ acker , according to information of the town of Has@@ lach , it is possible to demonstrate a graduate engineer or Bachelor with the field of architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and builders .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ at@@ Office are standing and civil engineering , building plans , gra@@ under@@ age @-@ related opportunities , administration of urban lifts , urban operation , as well as a sub@@ sid@@ y authority , including monument protection .
bike on lines thrown : southern section closed
according to the police , so far unknown perpet@@ rators had the blue bicycle from the railway line in the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so severely damaged , that the her@@ al@@ izing freight train had to be needed .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and search for the night lessons after them .
near the Tat@@ ort , witnesses were observed by witnesses a ros@@ ettes and a bike driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rator had brought itself into great danger and also end@@ anger@@ ed the rail@@ ways .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the installation and the delay and the delay unit and costs for rail transport , even more p@@ enn@@ es of railway customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
in total , the spokes@@ man said one of the &quot; considerable &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker .
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south track could not be guided without disabilities .
there were just under ten staff appearances on Friday morning , two of which await the correspondence .
freight lifts did not look back , but they had delayed delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 meters of upper lines .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the contrary : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory diseases might be left .
the un@@ acceptable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000 , caused mag@@ nets and bli@@ sters , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the person concerned , meat and dairy products are advised to prevent their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins work to develop immun@@ o@@ gens that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes who hide themselves in food , do not enter into the body .
cells that are able to resol@@ ve inflamm@@ ations are balanced by cells , protect the tolerance and protect the body without exc@@ essive tissues .
if the balance is near to inflamm@@ ation , it can result in an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments I was found that a kind of tolerance to immun@@ ity immun@@ ity occurs in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in its bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of protein - to resol@@ ve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had the more immune cells . &quot;
he proposed that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an abundant nutrition toler@@ ate , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel supports when the same system also promotes humans .
the Post @-@ doctoral degree in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was seeking out a kind of immun@@ otherapy that had found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had been separated .
it believes that the difference to do with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ds of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the gast@@ ro @-@ intest@@ inal Tra@@ kt .
the mice of mice were found DNA sequ@@ enz@@ es and there were six species of bacteria found in mice with the immune cells , but without it lack@@ ed mice .
mice were taken up in an ster@@ ile environment , so that they were a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ al and not developed these kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria have grown to the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into tolerance @-@ to @-@ tolerance cells .
as the active component of the liquid is cleaned , it proved to be known as a secondary product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism which is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the for@@ ter of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ ones were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ able cells such as mice , and that most of us will protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known whether tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; The development of this cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the gut .
potentially , high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ ones can lead to a range of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; Genie &quot;
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; Genie &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins , and impres@@ sing in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
M@@ atic was not exp@@ elled from the blues Asia tour of the blues , but only 45 minutes , which Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho could access that he had to improve before the Premier League @-@ season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , an gen@@ ius in the way , as he th@@ inks - he th@@ inks of football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready more than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic began Victor Lin@@ del@@ ity and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u at Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho yet wanted to wish three other new comm@@ it@@ ments , but it insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of his four pre@@ defined new commitment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three of four , I thank the association &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happy if they get four of four , but they have given big effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the Silhouette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
to the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a cardio test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising earlier .
the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new de@@ fle@@ ction for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind twi@@ sted : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD chief , the Socialist Prime Minister &apos;s Prime Minister is always with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no fault out of the party central , just no return wind from the Federation - this was the most important wish of election dam@@ pers .
Martin Schulz has changed the party since Martin Schulz has changed dramatically .
since then , the associates collabor@@ ating from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ house with an aston@@ ishment of the events in the SPD @-@ governmental capit@@ als .
what Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with counter wind .
there were deep envelop@@ es .
and one after the other .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and Gre@@ ens are visible .
&quot; this again shows more : red @-@ green can be easily reg@@ ained , &quot; said CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber of the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising fra@@ ction of a Green @-@ M@@ EPs set out the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the Parliament election the red @-@ green Coalition lost their One @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ President Michael Kell@@ ner sum@@ med up the tr@@ ab@@ ian Green @-@ Sax@@ on Green member El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return their mandate .
the transition to the CDU means a clear re@@ aring of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and elec@@ toral campaign of the Green Editor Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD elections being gro@@ aned on Friday morning , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ ox had reached the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green M@@ EPs El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU without his own government majority .
it is the preliminary cli@@ max of a whole rows of large and small cr@@ ises in the SPD state feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what next is coming .
the Mis@@ ere began with un@@ expect@@ edly defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , qui@@ res the sho@@ ots of stone .
according to the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was then too bad - and everything was worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD , and the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite had the party smooth .
in the weeks , the genre strug@@ gled again in the weeks afterwards .
then when they had exhau@@ sted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next deep beat .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was sitting in the Als@@ ace harmon@@ ie , while his city burned .
and because he was wrong , and because he did not make anything wrong , what is wrong .
since then fire@@ wood fought for his political survival .
now there are Stephan Weil .
due to the VW @-@ exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board of the Supervisory Board of Lower Saxony had already been in criticism .
Mi@@ ese surveys were added .
nevertheless , or maybe even so , because I tried to set acc@@ ents in the covenant for the past few weeks .
the asp@@ ir@@ ation of the former Mayor of Hannover , to build his power in Berlin , remained un@@ hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they left him , because they spoke about a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
on this occasion , because of the internal internal ken@@ nel , because there is no fault in the party internal conductor .
and Schulz didn &apos;t know .
therefore , the com@@ rade is therefore to keep their own rows closed .
their anger is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the tr@@ ab@@ ian par@@ liam@@ ents in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ ckers , such as Mr@@ s T@@ jack@@ ing her own career opportunities over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of Part@@ itions in the SPD Parliament , the editor for Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets is not elected as a direct candidate , but elected by the national list of the Dutch Gre@@ ens on the national list of Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that they return their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliament , &quot; compl@@ ained a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ ler@@ w@@ ille four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil to the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Dutch SPD as a leading candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career of a future CDU @-@ delegates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he needed to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if more has been more or more information of the CDU Lower Saxony has been given .
conveyor belts for local core III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years , may soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ am Urban Development on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave up a look back on the events so far .
since 1991 , it has been involved in sensation of san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the San@@ sid@@ y area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Baden @-@ Württemberg State took over two thirds of the funding amount .
the sub@@ sid@@ y area II from 2005 to 2016 was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it was finally important to promote and un@@ lock the interior design .
on April 4 , one will receive the information from the government &apos;s government office in Karlsruhe that there will be a san@@ itation area III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which you have 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the congregation sen@@ ses .
how do we create a san@@ itation area ?
you will continue to examine the in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned field ever interest , to san@@ itation .
if necessary , the borders may then shift again .
the jet@@ ty occurred on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cell@@ ars presented the contents of the &quot; Social City &quot; Federation for the &quot; Social City &quot; in its framework .
core of the program are the revol@@ ving of inner cities , enh@@ ancing the residential and working conditions and expansion and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would have been evaluated , that is done per plot , done .
the remedi@@ ation area would then be established as a statute .
the approval period for the funding period has been running until January 1 , 2017 , until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , once again the inventory could be carried out , in the context of the re@@ organisation involved , a questionn@@ aire should be filled out .
as of November or December , the proposition is scheduled to take place in the next year with the renov@@ ations .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that each commune had to carry out preliminary investigations .
it is therefore to evaluate the urban abuse and decide when it is san@@ ated and in which extent .
there will be a san@@ itation written in the land register for the respective land .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensation and make a picture of the location , she promised them .
Got@@ zel stressed , a major success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
therefore there will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens over the next weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and site bow , &quot; where it comes among other things to build the construction and renov@@ ations .
in grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing , &quot; can be made to size , spl@@ itting and inhabitants of a residential area .
the blue &quot; Operation bow &quot; can only be filled when used in the building business premises .
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a questionn@@ aire is not at the same time a request for funding is not at the same time .
in addition , new construction works must not be eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still stressed that the distribution of funding is working after the &quot; wind @-@ design principle &quot; - who first comes , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
one could not have to reserve any funding of the &quot; later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the end , pictures of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; village II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been shown to make a restoration of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor puts itself a micro@@ chip to come with a manual movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , that it can open his front door to his office and start even with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index and now offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ esth@@ esia in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , merged to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr North@@ am wants to change the pal@@ aces in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of One has now installed both at home and also at his BMW Z4 technology that starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the promotional fees of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a n@@ avy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event , which fixes the American manufacturing in the last month , cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the data of the military , which have been transferred to the TI@@ ME Magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American design programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter was built in Connecticut in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White House asked the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter to the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware of it , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event in his superior , the Deputy Head of the Aviation Office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter met on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn at the South La@@ wn and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure is delayed from the White House , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would need for the return flight .
the original passenger crew was during the event with the helicopter while the security staff remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
out of the TI@@ ME &apos;s records , we did not notice whether a second flight is required .
the Hatch Act stip@@ ulates federal property , state property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked if the event could determine the appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we were asked if it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are shut up , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political surface colors .
at the event , the president gave a violation of the reform of health reform that was in the Senate in the G@@ ange , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to support the reduction of government regulations .
the use of the airplane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from polit@@ ically advant@@ age@@ ous purposes .
Pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but your use only for a photo OP , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation into an investigation as the presidential plane before the background of his first campaigns in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ Services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential election due to its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is impressed by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the representative of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 crew often lead training flights in the region around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to en@@ force the US President in the White House with precise centimeters .
as Tr@@ ump in Germany at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 practice land@@ lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was counted with the training requirement for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flo@@ ats 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers had no load to no other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not include bud@@ get@@ ing drawings for the presidential flights , and it &apos;s difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ arians , the US Ministry of Defence in 2017 is the Do@@ D refund for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , however , 24.@@ 380 USD per flight lesson .
notes of unity include the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers in the basis of estimates for the construction sets is highly ir@@ reversible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the refund kits for Do@@ D does not include the personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former press release of the White House , S@@ ean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think , like most Americans are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have un@@ ti@@ relessly worked .
it is of course adequ@@ ately to raise it . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ ag@@ ated with helicopter , when he finished his tour through the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump , Tr@@ ump , spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to make sure in the managers of the Bis@@ c@@ ite manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie about the long @-@ term commitment to the production in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has led over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , besides other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said that he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; would be experienced when their activities would change .
in a letter to the company &apos;s stores , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s response to &quot; concerns that funding for the moderni@@ zation of production lines do not be powered . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity of the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross .
generations of families have been working here and working forces strongly concentr@@ ating on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , a major pillar for de@@ cent employment in an area of high unemployment and social experiences .
therefore , under the perspective of work@@ stations , wage and prosper@@ ity , and in the background of the Bre@@ x@@ ite , the increasing life business costs and chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a flor@@ ist production of Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to that , since we estimate the continuous commitment at employees and trade union representatives .
we had two months ago a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we are like all the companies active in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate business , and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cross @-@ cross @-@ site , particularly in production lines and operating improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the inheritance of tac@@ cross @-@ cross as a production site and totally on . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned about three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League likes her interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in their persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after making an offer of £ 189 million , in order to resol@@ ve its free@@ wheel yoke , but they warned of Barcelona three years ago in front of the world war ?
the sensational approach has been heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United returned .
after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athl@@ ete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way , as N@@ ey@@ mar dates back to outside , although a source in the vicinity of the Catalan board insi@@ ders that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but the soccer world was warned about the PS@@ G President three years ago ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association , who wanted to sign up the best player of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not careful because they need to touch one of our players , then we will contact their players in opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are respec@@ ting all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players at sign , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish club had not express their interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G clearly stated that it would not allow it to go to the International Criminal Court under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this inter@@ esses by losing their discount for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report de@@ bur@@ dened e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse of Pope @-@ Bro@@ ther Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this was the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the Miss@@ bre@@ ch@@ and@@ al near the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station ensures discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ er , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated according to the German press agency , he acquired from former Reg@@ ens@@ er bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the Pope Benedict XVI , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ itus Pope Benedict XVI .
it would serve the vision of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express their deepest regre@@ t on their own sub@@ missions or their then false assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , critic@@ ized that in reporting on violence against violence with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two different measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as regards the inter@@ ventions in Regensburg , no one knows that it would have to be en@@ forced and damaged , &quot; but the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manip@@ ulation , &quot; so the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience , is part of everyday experience and is preparing the public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
also the prin@@ cely Gloria of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is meant with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; they are happy to go to the church and this is a spot@@ ted fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Moreover , she pointed out that in their adolesc@@ ence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stro@@ kes a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical product , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with joy@@ ful children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are un@@ fair , present standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
completely wrong , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who sum@@ med up the reminder &apos; My brother of Pope &apos; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which is submitted by the bish@@ op@@ ric of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment Law Ulrich Weber submitted ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been sexually viol@@ ated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with a high level of pill@@ aging &quot; victims of survi@@ vors , 67 dom@@ ination .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was working in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994 , so it can be noted that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and mental violence .
even at high E@@ motiv@@ onal@@ ity , the punishment for students could also be violent .
in contrast to numerous other conf@@ essions , many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. estimates , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories are linked to him . &quot;
in the interview E@@ emann , why the final report on the Miss@@ ant sk@@ and@@ al was explained in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger from his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report about the &quot; Inci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; are a contra@@ dic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a lifting many students his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the other hand , it also appears as a Chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became the econom@@ ist when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz made no top performance .
how do you know as its bi@@ ograph this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present in it .
he has just dedicated eight pages , and he is clearly acquitted of every suspic@@ ion of the medi@@ ation or co @-@ infection in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence of violence in the pre @-@ school took place outside of its effectiveness .
you can write to him if too late or first , it is not enough to have taken too late .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ym@@ nas@@ ium , on which he worked , was taken from practically all respon@@ dents than - so literally - &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
so also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; lu@@ ent &quot; , &quot; competent , and &quot; under@@ stand@@ ably , &quot; as an extremely high @-@ level teacher that provided the guys regularly with cake , bis@@ cu@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always provided the grapes of grapes from children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high brightness , which also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ ages .
that he did not only bring with the chairs and the keys and the keys to the ground , but also ear@@ ching and all@@ ying guys to the hair or ears , he himself has to be deeply regre@@ t and exc@@ used for it .
however , to his honour is said that such correc@@ ting methods in frag@@ ile period , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely used in parents like teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone from us who was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced this in a school , a state school , a state school .
compared to what it is actually doing in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and violence at the school , are they of Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
as one asks , if it wasn &apos;t even rather to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI , many media has just turned on him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many people have never understood him , still felt fri@@ gh@@ tened .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report much more about the topic of abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant was reported in connection with the report .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be placed in the final report some problems or co @-@ workers in regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have committed itself to the cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never told me to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a person representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ assing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem during the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of Sex@@ ual abuse was and is that most victims were silent .
if they did not have parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then not a ch@@ orus , who would have been a member of the perpet@@ rators .
how to evaluate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen school R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a frag@@ ile student form@@ ulates that : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case , in which he would have had thought out ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) .
I hold it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , accept that it counting him ... Bu@@ ben in@@ sist@@ ently or clear@@ er or even more , than with their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ conductors , Confi@@ dence instru@@ ctors , etc .
that one speaks about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the lead person concerned students and / or their surrounding area could not be confirmed as part of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned , is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger free of charge .
so it can &apos;t be accused him to prevent him or to have taken it .
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contra@@ di@@ ligent crimes in combination , as it happened in some cases .
in the media was much of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the earlier domain name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown out in the report .
do he have to live with this preliminary design ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem that mixed and de@@ men@@ ed in the coverage of a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere in the middle of the band , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that &apos;s exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
there will be clean separately : between the school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report dates from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ orus of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant .
the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which the boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers have been en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed and among them were horri@@ bly , took all themselves on the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sk@@ ill@@ ous states have to be prev@@ ailing .
but with which Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only on the face as they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ y nas@@ ium .
on it was like most of the most witnesses , the theme of &quot; Vor@@ u School &quot; was tab@@ oo .
one was just happy to come to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ this &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ y nas@@ ium ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : indeed , discipline , but there was no sa@@ dist@@ ic power .
and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report has come to the conclusion that &quot; many victims are estim@@ ating the general life of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories are linked to him . &quot;
so most of the design is left to have seen away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods where it was reported by the states on the preliminary school .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he had just started to establish and from its predecess@@ ors at a school where he was not active and responsible , ( as the witness ) nothing wanted to hear , and then again in 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger shut down the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ym@@ nas@@ ium , the report even re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this point he indicates that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the school was still pract@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative symptoms , he penet@@ rated an ur@@ gent matter .
that was , of course , of course , as a legal clarity , was banned in Bavaria as a test bed in Bavaria .
before , it took place in a legal gre@@ y@@ zone , as everyone knows of us still white .
it was too hard for him to estimate where the affected might have been ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the allow@@ able limit was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say that he would have w@@ asted away .
that is not true .
the test was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980 and was officially abolished in Bavaria .
in the Gloria of Th@@ urn and Taxis , it is un@@ fair to use today &apos;s educational standards to the former times .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we talk about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is the danger to evaluate the past in today &apos;s moral standards .
there has already been quite righ@@ tly .
but this is not true for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ duc@@ ed at all times , and not for that which was broken up in their pre@@ school@@ ing and violence against innocent children &apos;s pra@@ w@@ ns , which goes far beyond that time .
that &apos;s all quite aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally getting started .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
so far , his means to discipline and punishment , i.e. ear@@ ching and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a physical punishment then was forbidden , he has also kept stri@@ pped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what image of his reg@@ iment was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
came the subject test to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , tells of its perspective , as the domain ranks played only one side .
nevertheless I didn &apos;t think there was a rig@@ ging reg@@ iment there .
but also this has to be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , it would probably have been possible to form a widely known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen an institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with K@@ ek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons one only makes a rebel@@ li@@ ous boy once again , no big singer and before each success stand still in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ win@@ der .
than what a man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the talks in their book ?
Michael H@@ atz@@ inger : through the work on the book and in addition I have learned Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well @-@ learned and always experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep faithful and warm people , from which one could not imagine that he could only do anything else in a fly .
I &apos;m getting regularly with how many former domain casts are still alive today , 23 years after its Emer@@ iti@@ ation , regularly visit to him - he is almost blind - and him like a member of their family .
those who have not been awarded him until today , that he once was strictly to them are clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral spar@@ rows are grat@@ eful to him today that he has en@@ riches their lives and to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , voc@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent Father , dar@@ iss , it may be - but also a del@@ ight@@ ful re@@ vocation , to which they are still looking forward and honour them .
and please , at once more clearly : all that one should submit to him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time .
but it &apos;s highly od@@ d , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and one even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin bo@@ ck .
there is the evil intention behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just released , last@@ ly it .
now the stand areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who had acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bay@@ erns , and perhaps Germany probably nobody want to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station , finally in peace .
