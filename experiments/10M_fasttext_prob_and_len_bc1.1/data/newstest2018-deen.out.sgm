<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your sight to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An mistaken operation where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A greeting chapel, where now for the S-Bahn tunnel is dug up.</seg>
<seg id="4">The small gardener generate the lonely reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It nervous when country cards are not present.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to give itself excitement, because the Auto-Navi was taking place a green meadow instead of a paved road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of geoportas in the state government, are all the other than currently - but just therefore very thrilled.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a flip carpet, which one cannot recognize as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Into the large map map for cities and municipalities detailed maps, so-called uranium sheets, were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were made according to the Bavarian surveyor administration between 1810 and 1864 and skipping the first measurement of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the spring of 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted a survey of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns in order - of course, of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops landed with the peace of Lunéville in February of 9, 1801: the present neighbours, which the idea of a surface-covering of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project again and founded the" Topographic Bureau "" "" - and thus the Bavarian State Department. "" "</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urposition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others in the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison Spring / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown steadily.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling, that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shipyard was held 21 years after the creation of the map, so in 1877, as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of subsedlings concentrate around 1856 along the Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the West park is, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: when adding a smaller card with dutzing lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called "Urption," which was derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area distinguishes itself north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810, was the scene of the October, was actually a meadow, and there was no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the uranium sheet reads in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, not only the road name "at the restaurant" or from the height "On the fan," but also in big letters "mistaken operation."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfield road there were once more people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich District-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer fan."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden initiated the institution - that psychiatrist who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, to wander the so-called.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has directed the staff to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Initially for 280 patients was first place, later it was expanded to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost has been there since 2006, one of the largest psychiatrist of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the age of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order received the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth camp with training courses.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the soccer field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, it was erected by the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural rejection to the origin of the Irrenanstalt, who had been destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was in 1856 as the "main square," the merchants name was "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The allies of the Allies broke out in December 1944 many holes into the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a Grukapelle from the Middle Ages were once again on the Marienhof, where this day began work and take place on April 5, 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn railway line.</seg>
<seg id="49">Compare with the slider to compare the old Munich map with the aerial photo of today and fill the hole in the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights Group published travel agent for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colour has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policy and racial attacks by the State of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Committee for the State of Missouri, which will be into effect by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and missourianer, as a number of fragmentary events in the last time in the whole state and listed here," says it in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent Act of Missouri, which human beings are difficult to win discrimination against discrimination, as well as the prosecutions authorities of the state, to admittedly the group to publish the travagation, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"you have violations of the civil rights that happen people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be routed because of their skin colour, they are defeated or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such an incidence that we haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has been issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents like racial distortion against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol at the beginning of the year, after he had not taken any gasoline by the state and accused of the police of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the General Attorney General of Missouri, in which black drivers are more common in the state 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is aware that people are aware of their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri." "" "Chapel said." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "the people must be ready to bring with the money or the relatives that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri was reported in the year 2015 100 Hasselt, according to the latest figures from the Hassverge Report of the FBI, which stages the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel agent is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult to accuse a company for home or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel dates for Texas and Arizona, after the States have passed immigration authorities to undertake people because of immigration cases, which will contribute to the further development of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel dates are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of other countries, but in the last time, stakeholder groups have been used as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is Elementar</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidecaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken place a picture above the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the spinning yard of the Schwendemann family met representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU during the Association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted insights into his farm where he runs 55 hectares of meadows and 40 acres of forest cultivated, 40 dairy cows and equally many young animals and houses five apartments in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwald milk" is the alternative way for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests are exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the "Elemental Analysis as" Elemental Analysis. "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't bring back on derart steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area for a lot of work, much must be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here with the conditions and with the topography" "", "stressed by Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he acquired the elternal operation and cultivated this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he has no biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the community has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad to promote the Leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">With costs from 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the carpooling of the surfaces could still be pulled out a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and do thoughts on how they continued their operation," "" "the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often responsible for the promotion of criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure of the area is 40 hectares, which can not be missed until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs of 71 500 Euro, half of the leader was funded by leader, a quarter carried out by the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">This means that the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of wheat.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a good job, without farmers and farming."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood: "here are the best food produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The State Court of Baden-Württemberg (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of wheat.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">A prerequisite is the presence of the conveyors of the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the inocative area may not be evacuated (slope over 35 percent) and thus must be threatened by the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 fish herdfence project in 2018, the request of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure of the area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are estimated at more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is now taking place in the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it, if they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate the same as any other - hence the sorship of Saddam Hussein's sentence on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key Ideologist of Trump regime, knew what he did when he was a symbolic axe in a heat dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN about the proposals of the President to drastic immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue yourself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boilers and liberty-imitators would have thought about it, when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their significance, and in particular the importance that her attributed to her, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta imminated: "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem that you refer to that later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively true, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really around history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is concerned about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only one that invites you not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your labours, your poor, and thy beurgent masses, that desire to breathe freely, and destruction of thy rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eletide" was better to see our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed himself not in literary criticism - he did not clear that these people are not welcome in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict in importance to the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who voted for themselves to place their words after her death - did very good that they had a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republics by showing a classical representation of the feminine representation of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a whole name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativity.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to change the people from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The Great Schreihals Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was invited, but rather a early Neophrenia, who wanted to bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not lighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something completely.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the position of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was in it to see them so as they had seen from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often horrible travel on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is not the perspective to recognize the Miller and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not shine the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m distance, whereas Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team kapelle.</seg>
<seg id="140">Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their capitals talk was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or where they live or train, went out of the room and felt very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh were very natural, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth of silver medallists who will compete for their fifth World Championships at the 400 m Hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 shots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">In Scotland, the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-range Muir runs on this way and has put up five British and two European records last year.</seg>

<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, since we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put this home support and benefit from it that we are again at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: don't take you a public post if you don't want to heat the electoral of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our land knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him due to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shimed at the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't have his critics to silence.</seg>

<seg id="166">This will bring me to Maryland for Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on it more than Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted your opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberal Union accused him in the beginning of this week.</seg>

<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his electors and to debuted its hair-loose head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the site of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and eventually dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse argued the acts of the governors and argued that the comments of comments has nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of the uncontrolled or spoilers or water filled people who are online the whip's winches online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post talked with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>

<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous days if you have had the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers and demonstrators to burn or demonstrators to burn or demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens just digitally.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery-Areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m. on a Serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted from this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The Rescue and Preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoter of tumours to their suit.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini: "it is a unique little town."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle has been mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg Urgent Urgent documents: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the most well-known parish church at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark sterling silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the certificate, on the Tumlinger Berg, the former parish church was also a splendid courtyard, which belonged to the church or the patron of the patron church, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">Like from the description of the Upper Freudenstadt in 1858, beside the village and the Oberdorf, which today are still visible in the town of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the splendid village centre of the village.</seg>

<seg id="476">The Patronatsrecht was created from the early medieval native law.</seg>
<seg id="477">One lord, who built a church, took out and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also be heir to this owner.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus it was the right to use a priest, or to act a new priest for the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars were in the church, and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greatest of the two zeroes on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell was then launched in 1692, but later was to be submitted to the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were stolen and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops invaded the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used it as a firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to overthrow 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">By 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the tower tower had to stand.</seg>
<seg id="490">In 1834 a storm sunk the tower in 1834 and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent an evil, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only today still existing tower-werg stayed as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict information on President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporters Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new chief of Staff of the White House, in his first working day with executive staff, he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Trumps white house which he repairing himself: bad information, who has come into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence, because the president would make better decisions, when he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Ways diagnostic makes sense, but others have tried to count Trump by using its media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship goes back to television in decades - and now, where he is in the White House, its TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the trump was offended due to unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places given to convince," said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February opposite POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter custom under control, according to six former electoral union officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption has a steady lobster."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Alright.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign agents know something that we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets could not contain more combustible material yet without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know about the tweets that did not send Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">When his staff had made it some times, trouble from him, then their efforts have been worth the effort.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has it resolutely prevent Trump controse.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists, that people in a white house, which places out of competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda by helping to present their own views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - entirely busy with this history - reported in May about the preference of adviser, President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"recent and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press sections, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that he is trying to recover from whence these are.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February when someone accused a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chairman of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a cluster of Lecks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banished from Twitter, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he expressed false allegations in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask members of Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tries to implement a system to manage and document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective managers as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still continues to influence.</seg>

<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller has widened its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN station reported that there is already first invitations of the Gremids in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies accused the Kremlin to have targeted specifically in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined if there were aborted between trumps election campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigations, several men are to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to the report, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special creator of Trump personally put together into the center and looking for the demonstration, if the President ruled the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys, it is to examine and decide whether the prosecution is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand jurys are therefore called to count chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they will be switched on if it is bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The committee can also be turned on by the Prosecutor to download persons for the hearing of Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, pre-invitations have already been issued to turn around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who participated in the meetings were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">Moreover, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. also Trumps were also consultant and in-law Jared Kushner and his early elections, Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-wing experts said on Thursday night in US television that the application show that Mueller would not be sober in his work, and that it should be necessary to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it must not necessarily be called evitably that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the committee of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in research and a new reason to concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the middle of the new disclosure of the President on Thursday evening an address in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>

<seg id="1510">Because of this Rauswurfs we had become dropping against Trump, he wants to handicapped the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to evaluate the investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under large pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special mediator and his staff.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the western Arctic the gigantic iceberg has loosed from the barely seven times of Berlins from the Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Zarhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The more than one trillion ton heavy and 5800 square kilometres of big coloring work now to the north and probably will probably take two, three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the biggest ice rants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in breaking down the ice, is unclear according to research information.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, since about 30 years, there has been a series of unusual collision of ice-harps in the region, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factor.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, that could be interconnected with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The coloss coloss continued to date a part from Larsen-C-Schelfeis so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floating on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">So it continues to grow into the sea and is steadily increasing.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this shripenises was the balance of wax and break off some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfeis may be trodden there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It was a lot to say that even the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Moreover, the ice plate under voltage and could be trodden down, if a piece of keys could be broken.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melt by Schelfeis and Eisberg increases the sea level, as they slows on the water and pushed ice as much water as it is after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of failure to handle that glaciers can be flowing directly into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a low degree, the British research project writes about the observation of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is according to AWI data, with almost 50 000 square kilometers, the fourth biggest Schelfeis of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the open ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural line and is no direct connection to climate change, the ice plate now comes into a endangered position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most far retreat since the start of records," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists have been disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will again grow again or in the long term, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if this researchers do not return to climate change this gigantic iceberg will not decline to climate change, but in the past decades there are very many ice-elions of Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long dial of Antarctica extends toward South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data of the British Antarctic Survey, the iconic surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature was contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula have passed by around three degrees in the past 50 years, thus narrowed in the areas where the temperature at the fastest stiff.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavendel in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in spring much less rain, and in autumn much more.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The staff of weekly Riodoce is usually taken on Wednesdays to review their plans for the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and irresistible drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But in that day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what safer feel: they should take their children with the office, who were the goal of a attack with granulates in 2009, or they will be at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have three words written on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose a name for any column - no evidence is necessary, trusts and abdominal feel.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug tasters, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the forbid list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that dangerous the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no resting period of violence, and during all the country the bodies of bodies, there are more journalists: at least 25, since then President Enrique Pena Nieto have surrendered to attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and its inspirator by Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistakes is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence will be deeply impressed, although its presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, that shows his middle finger with the word "Justice" on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, which show his ridiculous face with glasses or typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, the trauma, her nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>

<seg id="1823">As with the thousands of Morden, each year with drug trading and organic crimes are linked, the murderers of journalists will only be diagnosed in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and even though the terrain is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without righteousness, the meeting on discussion of safety is a little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>

<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was taken by two men. it was taken out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing as silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrest in January and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battlefield of the country since the rival factions struggling here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone can be shot or several people on the streets, or that the cemetery is full of consumed, two-storey Mausoleen for drug who are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only one cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the fault that he couldn't protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First published in February the publication of a interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of the rivalising cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may be offended with the children, the gangsters bought each copy of the edition, as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosk.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was in it, Valdez not to force, after confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country in his own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues draw, that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 USD holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without having regard to the noise poison" "", "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time, the newspaper served a reputation for the courageous and honourable coverage, and the turnover and advertising took.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters, hard-faithful investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories, nobody else could treat them.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where they also led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to be afraid.</seg>

<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sitting at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>

<seg id="1866">When it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell a sense that can be disappointed... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and other states, do not apply mutaloa as well as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where a poisonous blend of lucrative smuges, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>

<seg id="1871">Outside they sought two police protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who commit himself as a trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporter have passed into the mountain scenery, where the drug are facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has blocked three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There were the assassination of the former famous Boxo Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending, which concentrated on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the state-old, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about it, who was kidnapped, or how it happened, so be careful, as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug traders and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant under the name of a policy was registered, which was part of the Institutional Revolution Party (pri), which nearly all political levels ruled throughout the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several pri governors were accused of corruption because of high-quality cases of corruption.</seg>

<seg id="1886">The Office of Valdez was devoted to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the murders of journalists, because the staff had become something that they never expect: activist in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez laminated a few signs and entered the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the office of the State Court.</seg>

<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drugs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces, who have organized the organized crime under a blanket.</seg>

<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to blend better in its surroundings and to prevent their enemies, experts predict that there was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal, and it is called Borealopelta markmitelli after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>

<seg id="1943">They discovered the constellation, a widespread defense method in the animal, which means that the top of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the allocation is usual, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta exceeds that of today the living animals exceeds today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs were chased out of sufficient pressure through the carnivorous dinosaurs, the evolution of confrontation of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to study the answer to question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken by their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after they arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police has just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the road." "" "she was named there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since no one had postponed the information on its feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ theePharoah was constantly retaining its timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officers in Ferguson, Mo., was killed, live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblosem body that was on the road and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "this is wild," "" "I thought of himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was not new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">It took her mobile phone to return later on the evening on Tweets on people on Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos from the police band and people, the cried, and by a man who claimed to be Browns father, who gave a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons Police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They observed a live feed at which a police station stood before a group of demonstrators with an invertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said," "" "another police is his crying and cried," "" "I will kill you..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered their statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"that is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and we can be called."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment, I was feeling contactor.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of overlife and the protest, the love and the loss of strength, strength and resistance, which are made up of the point of people living in the community and the streets are filled to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell was with her daughter, who brought a flower dress and a matching crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation, that they had countless times before this morning "over the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "I remembered you, as I taught you when black people have to fight for that of what they believe?" "" "he remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we now go to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take it, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It has to know and to see it in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only active and organisation, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to free yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I experienced good luck you have experienced an experience in which they personally experienced non-ekanant racism, it is not different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep them far off. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp as the activists on the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There are Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local company owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and halved them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to take a new kind of activism for ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August totally," she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Ncourse Association and focused on essence of justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met in an evening demonstration of Sabaah Folayan, one of the film director of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar would only want to document, "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question was Ferrell in the meaning: "want to document or try to find a story that you can utilize?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white, in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan explained recently in an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices have not been centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around Todestract-occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project closer, along with six other native musicians followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people are depicted, for so I will be displayed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that there is in motion "not around a Messiah guide, but around a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">According to what are documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, how she loves and marry her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that it has to give a certain amount of injuries for this work and the decomposition of a black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black pregnant women in the wider Black-Lives.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of movement, who have marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media after the killing of the black teenager Martin in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, pregnant women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we fight in different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant women have to wear the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan voted to note that "the movement truly kept the movement of black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insisted that" "" "this is not a dramatic type of action" "" "which was chosen by ferrell because of their identity as the heart of the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who opened this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although she was at the front front, because in a life at these crossings than a black, pregnant woman is so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the message cameras in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Yet they cled to a vocals and she feels complete this memory, since she left for three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">"" "from" dream "to" "" "size wahn" "" ": TV readers discuss about Bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although they were not built long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the South's pedestrian zone has since the first presentation in 2009 the population in Being and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic is hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg," the subject is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one-bit gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be a real class" (Nicole Schaumann), comes from the other side: "does not need a man" (Siggi Baking) or quite simple: "size wahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">During the fears that a gallery has more customers to the city, of which the other business also benefit, fear the adversaries, that then the pedestrian zone bleed.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned to be found on the property on which the peasant market stands in which 13 directors are marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work is finished with the start of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and there is a place for Beda-Platz with a possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we've been selling almost weekly in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the land are very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">The butchers are also discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to announce that, while and especially after the building of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct market is marketed in the gallery, arrives at the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">This is likely to be low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what was shopping in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drillers or supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Of which there are enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But there is not even an ordinary weekly market here, it is the more important that we have received at least the Markthalle.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the goods offered is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer, and is not an endless.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shop shops are rented in a shopping mall just by larger firms, because the holiday rentals are often not portable.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special transactions there is almost no longer and what is left, then will vanish even disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Trafficking: "a shopping mall with a Markthalle suits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant market place during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even in length if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or creates it the bit-bit gallery before, to drive all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that is empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">My view would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market, it is possible thanks to the mad of many - how I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant market is set, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which hang almost unnoticeably - those on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupils and Haaruttons created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analysis operates in a 35-year sentence after she publicly made diplomatic information about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August, A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg who joined their specialist expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a mission and groundbreaking discsidy, whose condemnation had been converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp analysis of the DNA that could extract from Manning, and out of the 30 portraits, such as anyone can be interpreted with this genomic data - the many wise men can be interpreted as they can be interpreted and the infirmament determinants of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been spoken openly concerning the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges, including six violations of the Spy law, computer and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison the picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one picture - a grab, black-white Selfie, sitting in the maning is clearly visible on a driver's seat and a platter onde was associated with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of its 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of strange artifacts such as cigarette stems and chewing gum by removing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of it, like those people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany this article," "" "declared Dewey-Hagborg with a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And it could not be visited at that time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and its incarcerated muse were made to unite Brieffel who ruled several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">She even created a question of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Suppression Images," which would be a future predicted in which the President Chelyell would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only a few days after the book was released, Manning, after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome sort of fortunate meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit depth and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads an war against informant from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweeter results in order to escape the rigid metal circuits, which he should actually fix to escape.</seg>
<seg id="2142">As a Dewey-Hagborg, after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is equipped with a heart) an end of the "automatic shredder, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg trusted, by the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific encyclopeon of the artist) to show how amazing, at least in biological ways, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people think that our genome is not concerned, who we are and how are genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are" "", "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, trace Memories, too." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a separate room is one side from the above mentioned comic Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as it appears with a free spins in the hands of the United States of the United States as King-Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predictive in the comic book - but if it should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room of masks, by their own genomic simulation, which is like Horses of Protestants.</seg>

<seg id="2226">Previously, if a employee would have to report a problem, he had to submit or she had an telephone number or email for the company headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was taken serious.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Create a Comic novel: a Castle in the History of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze-music video and was a squil hole for Margaret Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat at the Fent River Valley in Kent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of somebody who has been dead for 300 years," says he weary.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'encircled the time from the Middle Ages to the era of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another, coming British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he unexpectedly found.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I only reacts on the thumb pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double bed in the 1700-year-old, which he worked for the Jacobins." "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb pressure!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And they smell like smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives for 300 years later, the smell has a effect, as he himself would also be.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Ah, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so with old papering is that he has been assisted by the National Trust and the Arts Council England, and almost four months lived in a castle ("To be honest, I've got a little over a little over") that seems to be true to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days that the Victorian "new" Castle spent to study the archives and to study many treasures and curiosities of the castle, as they had spent the mounted Hyenches on walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with rural conservation, greens and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was only given the full access in 2006 when the last harvest, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes met a decade later, the employee began to take care of the archive that he said as "hundreds of years in which aristocrates said" Oh, unlock it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diary, letters from the time of the English Empires, maps, which could say: "you could mean that country-flees would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all its course! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection are using the castle as the starting point to come on a wider basis in the English history, among them 'The Labourer' which leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant status of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a record of an uproar, who entered the castle in 1380, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," "" "says Rhodes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant rose up in this area and I thought, a insurrection was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are connected together? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', telling the story of the Jesuit patented, the family of Darrell was hidden for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smugglers' in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell is represented in the 18th century by completing his own funeral by completing a sarg with stones (a discovery which was only excavated only years later).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentleman is appropriate gauner to be more debt and money for things that they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men crates their debt crises by being rich women's women - I present them as a well-looking guys, with a talent to get a landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes in search of other unique cry experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic-novel about Alsace-Poki behind him, the territory of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has been recalled again by nature.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can not be mad in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots can be found.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robot is currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take their rise.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eyelet of the robot, its form of the nipple and the type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "the people are funny, but the company deliver lots of these things, and we are still going to see it much more frequently," "" "said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin, which feels warm - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can customize his robot according to its beliefs "and can choose everything, from the eye color of the robot via the form of chest pain up to type or the colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it's still worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" who would look like a stepford-woman from progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The real botix robot makes it possible for example his users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing as for example.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then, the True Companion developed Roxxxy gold robots with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of tiredness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality. "</seg>

<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her voting - all as real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be weary to be fixed, or it can be "in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects in this ascent of sex robotic - not least because they replace real human relationships, but the subdictions on rape, if you get a step on frigid (means here: residenial) Farrah is intranquieted most of the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site, True Companion Roxxxy with an vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator why do men do not have Roxxxy?" "" "is it on the site." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, this sex robot does not only have a fat or content just another sextet.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing refinement indicate a bit darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the Ideal of Gender Equality to a wish after having sex with an optional allowance.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men of course do not stop sex robots, while the FRR noticed their rising popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what originates from the marginal zones, can be taught in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or obsceiving until the free market is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain endure that these high-developed sex robots occur in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House, who has insulated them sexually attacked.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great achievement?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the expression of healthy human lives</seg>
<seg id="2426">It is become a Binsenweisheit of the Trump era, that the political spelling that have polarised the US voters also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankow there were newspapers in the USA newspapers, how to deal with the horror of trump-selectable relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We toss all supposedly in order to burst out our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notorious is the power of Trumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, an left-oriented sealing in Chicago, has long been living in Chicago for a long time with the republicans in our family to visit me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It recalled me that the unit can have a powerful enemy against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican kindred, with which she fought in decades because of the politics, suddenly and very strange on the same site.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to be the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls in a further link that this also brings significant risks with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The Left was strengthened by trump, but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "Normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the grauselly possibility of getting us no longer a day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a long-distance long-time scenario, in the Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalised," which suddenly appeared in comparison to its standards suddenly as incomprehenness of deterioration.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find me today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney urcomic version of the traverse - the dog on the car, the 14% income tax (but at least did we know how its tax returns) - both in comparison to trump in fact appear as a very mild criminal offences.</seg>

<seg id="2443">The Central Park-carousel is still a strange experience, as there are two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s to go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could rate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately there was no man asked about it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions in a scale of 5 to five stars before I could draw my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In a coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compensate with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the contrary: a diet that is rich in meat-based protein and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with anti-inflammatory diseases might be left.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The unacceptable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, caused magnets and blisters, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the person concerned, meat and dairy products are advised to prevent their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins work to develop immunogens that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells in the intestines patrol, to ensure that harmful microbes who hide themselves in food, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to resolve inflammations are balanced by cells, protect the tolerance and protect the body without excessive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is near to inflammation, it can result in an anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments I was found that a kind of tolerance to immunity immunity occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in its bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had the more immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan abundant nutrition tolerate, less inflammatory bowel supports when the same system also promotes humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Post-doctoral degree in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was seeking out a kind of immunotherapy that had found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It believes that the difference to do with the intestinal microbids of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the gastro-intestinal Trakt.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were found DNA sequenzes and there were six species of bacteria found in mice with the immune cells, but without it lacked mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in an sterile environment, so that they were a intestinal microbial and not developed these kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria have grown to the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri in a liquid and then led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into tolerance-to-tolerance cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid is cleaned, it proved to be known as a secondary product of tryptophan Metabolism which is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the forter of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophones were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerable cells such as mice, and that most of us will protect L. reuteri in our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of this cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially, high tryptophones can lead to a range of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report deburdened e-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This was the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the Missbrechandal near the Regensburger Domspatzen station ensures discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissener, spokesman of the reform movement "We are church," stated according to the German press agency, he acquired from former Regenser bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the Pope Benedict XVI, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the vision of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would like to express their deepest regret on their own submissions or their then false assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Law" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "in contrast, criticized that in reporting on violence against violence with" "" "two different measures" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">As regards the interventions in Regensburg, no one knows that it would have to be enforced and damaged, "but the" degree of medial manipulation, "so the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience, is part of everyday experience and is preparing the public opinion to keep it for normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also the princely Gloria of Thurn and taxis meant with the Bavarian Radio: "they are happy to go to the church and this is a spotted frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "Moreover, she pointed out that in their adolescence," "" "strokes a very normal pedagogical product," "" "to be done with joyful children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair, present standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who summed up the reminder 'My brother of Pope' (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection" "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which is submitted by the bishopric of Regensburg with the Enlightenment Law Ulrich Weber submitted?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen have been sexually violated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with a high level of pillaging "victims of survivors, 67 domination.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994, so it can be noted that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases of physical and mental violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even at high Emotivonality, the punishment for students could also be violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other confessions, many victims are estimating the general humanity of R. estimates, and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories are linked to him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Eemann, why the final report on the Missant skandal was explained in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger from his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report about the "Incidents of Violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" are a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for a lifting many students his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">At the other hand, it also appears as a Choleriker and perfectionist, who became the economist when a Domspatz made no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you know as its biograph this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger is present in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just dedicated eight pages, and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion of the mediation or co-infection in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence of violence in the pre-school took place outside of its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can write to him if too late or first, it is not enough to have taken too late.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzymnasium, on which he worked, was taken from practically all respondents than - so literally - "salvation", "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">So also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent testimony, describes him as "luent", "competent, and" understandably, "as an extremely high-level teacher that provided the guys regularly with cake, biscusen and Bonbons and" always provided the grapes of grapes from children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high brightness, which also led to Wutausages.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only bring with the chairs and the keys and the keys to the ground, but also earching and allying guys to the hair or ears, he himself has to be deeply regret and excused for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to his honour is said that such correcting methods in fragile period, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely used in parents like teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone from us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced this in a school, a state school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is actually doing in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and violence at the school, are they of Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">As one asks, if it wasn't even rather to do with his acquaintness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, many media has just turned on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many people have never understood him, still felt frightened.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report much more about the topic of abuse during the Regensburger Domspatzen plant was reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger will be placed in the final report some problems or co-workers in regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have committed itself to the cathedral-kapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never told me to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said a person representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem during the Enlightenment of Sexual abuse was and is that most victims were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not have parents and siblings, then not a chorus, who would have been a member of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How to evaluate the Domspatzen school Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a fragile student formulates that: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case, in which he would have had thought out (Georg Ratzinger).</seg>
<seg id="2939">I hold it... also for really absurd, accept that it counting him... Buben insistently or clearer or even more, than with their parents, internatsconductors, Confidence instructors, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "this report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in the lead person concerned students and / or their surrounding area could not be confirmed as part of the study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, is Georg Ratzinger free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it can't be accused him to prevent him or to have taken it.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradiligent crimes in combination, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was much of "nonviolence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The earlier domain name Georg Ratzinger is thrown out in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this preliminary design?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that mixed and demened in the coverage of a huge melange from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere in the middle of the band, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that's exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There will be clean separately: between the school and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report dates from the time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus of the Domspatzen plant.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases, in which the boys of sadistic teachers have been encircled and among them were horribly, took all themselves on the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really skillous states have to be prevailing.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with which Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only on the face as they were already at the Domspy nasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On it was like most of the most witnesses, the theme of "Voru School" was taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was just happy to come to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "parathis" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspy nasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: indeed, discipline, but there was no sadistic power.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report has come to the conclusion that "many victims are estimating the general life of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories are linked to him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So most of the design is left to have seen away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods where it was reported by the states on the preliminary school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he had just started to establish and from its predecessors at a school where he was not active and responsible, (as the witness) nothing wanted to hear, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger shut down the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of Domspatzymnasium, the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this point he indicates that" "" "the school was still practised" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative symptoms, he penetrated an urgent matter.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, of course, as a legal clarity, was banned in Bavaria as a test bed in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before, it took place in a legal greyzone, as everyone knows of us still white.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was too hard for him to estimate where the affected might have been exaggerated or dramatic and where really the allowable limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say that he would have wasted away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The test was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980 and was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, it is unfair to use today's educational standards to the former times.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we talk about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," that is the danger to evaluate the past in today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">There has already been quite rightly.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true for sexual abuse, who was abduced at all times, and not for that which was broken up in their preschooling and violence against innocent children's prawns, which goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all quite awful and I'm glad that it is finally getting started.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">So far, his means to discipline and punishment, i.e. earching and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical punishment then was forbidden, he has also kept stripped.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what image of his regiment was Georg Ratzinger for the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject test to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of its perspective, as the domain ranks played only one side.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless I didn't think there was a rigging regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also this has to be said: without these perfectionism, it would probably have been possible to form a widely known Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of Weltrang, true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With Keksen and Bonbons one only makes a rebellious boy once again, no big singer and before each success stand still in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-winder.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Than what a man did you experience Georg Ratzinger at the talks in their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hatzinger: through the work on the book and in addition I have learned Georg Ratzinger really well-learned and always experienced a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep faithful and warm people, from which one could not imagine that he could only do anything else in a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I'm getting regularly with how many former domain casts are still alive today, 23 years after its Emeritiation, regularly visit to him - he is almost blind - and him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not been awarded him until today, that he once was strictly to them are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral sparrows are grateful to him today that he has enriches their lives and to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, vocal teacher - a stringent Father, dariss, it may be - but also a delightful revocation, to which they are still looking forward and honour them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, at once more clearly: all that one should submit to him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it's highly odd, a man, only because he is prominently and one even more prominent brother to make a medial sin bock.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just released, lastly it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the stand areas, a 93-year-old man, who had acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bayerns, and perhaps Germany probably nobody want to know the Regensburger Domspatzen station, finally in peace.</seg>
