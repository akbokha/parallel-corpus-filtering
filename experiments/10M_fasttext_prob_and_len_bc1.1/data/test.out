gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger obt@@ ains the pyr@@ am@@ ines
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes , the horses remembered their closing ceremony , they pursued in fast g@@ opp home to feeding the feeding .
a kilometer at this pace , I have dre@@ amed .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the horse career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - back to horses .
he left himself with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t talk about photography .
long was the first time in Aachen , thereby also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Sport@@ th@@ ilfe reached the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small Gala to the Golden Sport@@ pil@@ es .
hon@@ ors all , it does not charge the sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men .
Federal Cross of Cross , Silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pil@@ es .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction means me very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring for decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the second mast winner was taken on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schm@@ itt , who belongs to Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , who Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , who gave his name Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Spr@@ ite , Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously of the hand@@ held of all Erhard .
many of these sports facilities came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively society went to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ az@@ za price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : IT &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the commercial agreement T@@ TP - that &apos;s both Clinton as well as tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential elections were , however , in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather more philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the in doubt rather small and warned against how the state of the economy does harm - with tax and regulations .
Clinton to grin@@ ders the economy to death and regul@@ ate death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
he will drive up@@ lifting massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for private people and for businesses .
Clinton said : the state has certain duties to meet , he has dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous opportunities to open and needs money .
that is why the taxes for the rich would be increased , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the infrastructure .
in which the must be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost wor@@ t@@ less .
the democratic candidate in announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ French Te@@ ach@@ y wings of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
thus , the internal discussions could be added to Tr@@ ump .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and drive the coal promotion in the USA again .
it is also possible to announce that in so far protected areas , the Parisian climate agreement will be announced .
in order to strengthen its investment program , Clinton aims to expand and demands : &quot; a country will create the super@@ structure of clean energies and create million jobs . &quot;
&quot; it is probably either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - also at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the well @-@ known trade agreement , they will not sign both .
at the same time , both the USA don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the international trade , but just use American jobs better .
they should then be paid better , calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars was a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump does not want to do this question isn &apos;t quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must go , then he says he would not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is probably likely to develop the control policy of both bearings .
on one side , tr@@ ump , which wants to loads the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold him before , that the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton who want to ask at least of the rich they will pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; any mist@@ ak@@ y woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are alone , almost every everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they often are trau@@ matic .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
each one has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has placed her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ itars with big eyes ne@@ ug@@ ly in the room .
his mother star@@ red on the table top .
until they notice that they will be observed .
she sm@@ iling short and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is a Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are pl@@ ough@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ ated accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the facility together with Pro Sagrada Familia and Munich &apos;s aid .
she officially opened it officially .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a wax before the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who has arrived here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they have persecuted political or death , because they send them their families or death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are some other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away from it , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their hom@@ eland they have done experience with sexual violence , forced dis@@ appearance , honour , slavery , or forced pro@@ st@@ itution .
it drives them on .
on the escape that goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ g for example for a bottle of water require a sexual action , isn &apos;t a rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they come in Germany , tell B@@ ahr .
even here all women in refugee centres would often be considered as a minim@@ ally considered and worse .
this leads to about 90 per cent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north , estimates them .
&quot; some of the children are not voluntarily surrendered . &quot;
many women are so usual that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust to speak openly about the living , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not want to help , there are more accommodation only for them , invites B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district authorities are responsible for the placing of refugees .
on the question whether they bet from a similar project , as in Munich in their condition , reply some with no .
there are some of them in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken &apos;s Ober@@ fran@@ ken &apos;s governments .
in Schw@@ aben , women are not separated from women alone , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ sidents of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia are available in some shared floors or houses only for all women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the privacy or women and women are accommodated together , it can be taught - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the shower room should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much women can feel this protective needs , one can read on the And@@ rang , which gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been talking about us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could easily be a second house .
assistance for Assist@@ ants : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new working group measures
deputy chairman of the assist@@ ants have called their union &apos;s union to oppos@@ e new jobs with their disp@@ utes regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) requested his entire Council , and from the beginning of September more labor measures to be appro@@ ached .
the J@@ DC had said that it would have been agreed to worry about the wor@@ ries concerning the contract .
in July , assistant and medical students have voted on the re@@ jection of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have been able to have problems with problems , which led to the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board is responsible to completely re@@ ject the proposed new contract and wor@@ ries the official new negotiations for all marri@@ ages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has put a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to make a ongoing program of labor measures that starts at the beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes resulted in that assist@@ ent of this year six times spread throughout the history of the N@@ HS .
according to the election of the BM@@ A Assist@@ enz@@ ist Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , according to the election of the agreed contractual conditions , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared the BM@@ A members during meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ent and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
according to the vote , the health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would not be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; Alliance of external lateral &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months of the war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin met his Turkish counter@@ player in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in receiving , I can &apos;t for@@ bid it , that Ankara wants to ad@@ mit this reconciliation in most .
there was a blow , yes .
but Put@@ ting the smile was nar@@ row@@ ed and he felt hardly heat , even for his rec@@ olle@@ ction conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; love &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report of all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve .
on the next day a newspaper wrote that Erd@@ og@@ an would have been so fu@@ cked , than would never be worse .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to signi@@ fy the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that the state of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the snap@@ shot of a Russian fighter aircraft by Turkey by Turkey .
Moscow proce@@ eded out of reaction at the time .
Putin shared from and accused Ankara to be back in the back of Russia .
this was even bigger , because it was already committed by a memor@@ able friend .
the Vet@@ rau@@ ry will build up again when it &apos;s impossible to become impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for the months , the state controlled media introduced a sharp , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
it seemed at once , when the Turks would bear the iniquity .
on the serious , the alleg@@ ations of senior officials were that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he disp@@ uted this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting occurred only because Putin was given to exc@@ use the exc@@ use of the President Erd@@ og@@ an , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of an arm@@ ist@@ ion is clear at hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an is primarily for all friends that he can get , after he became the last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat .
again , terror attacks on Turkey were also sh@@ aken .
but there are also economic moti@@ fs .
Russian sanctions met Turkey hard - especially the ban of bat@@ ches , each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number is dropped by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count on a late ais@@ les of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , state @-@ television endor@@ sed fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural are imported again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is looking back to the West , since it was a weak response to the attempted power of power .
in addition , the persist@@ ing gro@@ unding of the EU accession negotiations and Putin will come on it from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west .
in Ankara , the Russian state Secretary of State took a bonus to ensure that he called for the elected coup of government in Ankara .
that is well @-@ noted for Moscow , a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility for Moscow , which itself has a deeper fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ change .
the summit in this glorious palace by the sea made it possible in Russia and Turkey , an how it once described me a analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of external lateral ones &quot; : two countries that are cast off from the West and feel poor .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two still big differences .
the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow had recently restored the role as a peace party , but to support Russia and Turkey by mutual agreement .
it might be drawing that after nearly three hours of first talks , both President on the press conference said that they had not taken the topic once .
the president of Turkey for@@ mi@@ ed it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise these .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ner can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potenti@@ als for a perfect disaster , when the NATO member Turkey crossed the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the Chairman of the Bank R@@ BS , the R@@ BS brand is just to be reduced to a Back@@ office roller according to the board of Chief of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be no longer available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has since dist@@ ressed , when they had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this time brand name &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer goods .
it supported the international sport with millions of pounds in Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by until the Wimbledon winner of Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to make more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and public offering to Nat@@ West change .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used to customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other small brands for private clients that will receive more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN has been inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be one of our investment brand as well as the brand , under which our employees work , since we are now going to be a bank of stamps &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
I say now , that we don &apos;t track any global targets , but local targets .
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work among these stamps with clients .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be his Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing and will not be continued that it will increase the truth of various brands in his Sport Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop new brands , for how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ally three years ago when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched this brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can again launch this brands , therefore I think that time is come .

Russia Putin fired fire under chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin denied his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the closest confi@@ dential circle of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Finance .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it reads that Putin without speci@@ fying &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pre@@ sidi@@ ary administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was chairman of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 , in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he made his degree in Tokyo at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo in Tokyo .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the protocol and Chief of Staff of the government &apos;s government .
on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important role of the government to assist your activity as a state of state in compliance with bills and checks to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this stage has made the mysterious mystery of Moscow .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time of the nar@@ row@@ est confi@@ denti@@ als Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast@@ ed on TV , both men said that the Chief of Staff re@@ signs at his own request .
but despite the slow@@ ing for the cameras , here only few of them are convinced - mainly before the parliamentary elections .
is this so the result of a kind of power against ?
no one knows that .
but the official statement - that a man who was previously commen@@ ded as a potential President , to once the Russian environmental policy would like to lead to great sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his comments on Putin , who are cited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation with me this very complex - one could say almost any post for four years .
as it was out , I have been Chairman of the Russian Pre@@ sidi@@ aries for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed chairman of his deputy .
when Putin met his power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted in the most .
once again , Ivan@@ ov was supposed to have been President of Russia to the second term of President of Russia , as a third term of Putin could cast off against the Constitution .
but this item was taken by another , near ally , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before he returned to President three and a half years later .

Queens@@ land Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected with fi@@ ves
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of Queens@@ land Cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - what means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck@@ b@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10.000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , 46 shots of steel .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economics K@@ eit@@ h Brown took a visit to the site today and was one of the first that went down from the country to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment during the construction of Queens@@ land Cross@@ ing .
we are all witnesses of an aesthetic design of a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were alone used for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sealing is between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge @-@ deck , which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
a total of almost 79 % of the total bridge de@@ cks at their place and last section of the Dec@@ ks will get a bet@@ ong@@ le for the deck , which means that the entire Deck will be ready to reach the bridge at its square .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first clasp is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project makes the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high and deep construction .
after installation of the last street cover@@ ings and its connection with the North tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap at the north or shore .
this was reached by pulling the northern bridge bridge 700 mm south .
this was a massive and at the same time very he@@ at@@ le activity .
massi@@ vely , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up with an ascent of about 3 % .
un@@ cle because the tolerances , which the team works , tiny - on each side , it was only a few millimeters .
fortunately everything was very good .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown by fishing boats from the fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat was turned around , and put us the worst in front of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds have already stopped the boat out of their range , until we left to water &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man had exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found guilty without li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they all came on board the coastal can@@ ons and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the waters have not hurt , nor to be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop@@ over , however , in the insur@@ ers of the bo@@ ots of the person , the boat controlled the boat .
someone has raised over these men today .

who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Apartments ?
the SPD and Green mine : investors are expected to be stronger stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; Hand@@ held concept &quot; in the next meeting .
but battle is programmed .
the first line is about the question : who should actually build the favourable apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
the SPD faction leader Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; we are happy to build us with the green areas : who wants to build public areas in the future , must account for 20 percent of all apartments as a social apartments . &quot;
the affordable apartments can also be opened in stock .
however , the great disp@@ utes in the town hall was , however , so Fr@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as a social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing programme , which will cost millions of cost and is still funded , is intended for inc@@ en@@ tives .
the problem , such as Fr@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the lens wants to increase hardness levels for investors .
regardless of what , viol@@ mann , b@@ ted a dis@@ appearance of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept concept has been implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
yet the program is no longer available : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built .
but how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments whose funding is going to run in the next few years ?
by 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the plann@@ er spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought @-@ out ties from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price .
it is possible in the West city .
on a blow would solve the problem .
because in the Western city run from the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments there could be back in the price for cheap apartments .
only : we do not want the owners , the housing companies do not want .
because the number of social apartments in the West city is increased again and is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called bl@@ ending .
a concentration of social weak in only few neighbor@@ hoods should not be given anymore .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there is still a movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority the CDU must be with the boat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is concentr@@ ating on more buildings for family homes .
but what does not mean that no compromise can be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that worth it
it is fascinating , how the world changes .
for teen@@ ager and child for playing no longer go without , but it rather prefer to spend their leisure time , on screens to rigid , was accused of many compl@@ ained in the last decade .
with Pok@@ em@@ on Go it comes to get people from the sofa and become active more active .
the time on screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and last@@ ly on smartphones .
hence it is great to see that technology and activities are not un@@ locking in the outdoors .
I joined the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app that is based on the characters initially , which were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later it emerged from an animation series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenom@@ ena of populations sank the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed through the massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smartphone to outside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons which were followed with a GPS when they were found once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; can be captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game , when she was still younger , joined the valve and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35,000 users , shared the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed , that j@@ ump@@ ed every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data for the performance increase .
many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring &quot; themselves for 30 minutes , &quot; from the sofa to come &quot; and &quot; every day , &quot; shooting down their ears , because many public messages are bo@@ red , and they come from people who look like .
nevertheless , the meaning of sport cannot be evaluated .
who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances to cure cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages , which is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people can do something in the open , making them fun .
thus three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people close to the hunt even new friends .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ k @-@ destro@@ ys , which must always be compl@@ ain about anything .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if your smartphone apps could follow our activity as Fit@@ bit earlier , they gave us no reason to play sport as it does this game .
the new one will lose its friction and the use will be repeated with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons , there will be more games , apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist will be combined in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget your pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ ly is up to all that .
dynamic on the diving horse .
effortlessly on the beams .
breathtaking on the ground .
on all with brilliant .
and now also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaigns and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 stood clearly before the silver med@@ ail@@ len@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; clubteam nationals , A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ neth from the sulph@@ ur during the individual multi @-@ day event during the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als American who wins a multi @-@ day title and a total of the fifth , while she had fixed their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
they broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and their long voyage took place at this moment .
this success shows them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought their sports on new heights :
Bil@@ es domin@@ ates their sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou Res@@ cue of her said they &apos;ve ever seen &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a last examination in Brazil , a competition that went not so very between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather among you and a last over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man cared for , after they each have gold and silver in the unique event of women in the art acade@@ my during the 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , have won
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while on the f@@ arewell party of retirement in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi , she served as ex@@ clamation mark .
although it insi@@ sted on it , during their long stretch on the top , never planned the future , it is not true .
a part of their ground exercises - which includes their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would be at home on the street outside of the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child , and trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans Mutter was discovered during a school trip to the gym@@ nas@@ al , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost events competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will keep the way long as it wishes .
even if a pattern was slightly led by two turns , the picture has fl@@ amed .
sulph@@ ur and sm@@ ooth@@ es - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship titles - lau@@ rel .
she returned again with 15,@@ 433 on the sulph@@ ur @-@ beam again - and put it on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man re@@ im@@ pover@@ ished her as they expected En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ ade - a pure form@@ ality - and tears ch@@ ast@@ ened on Bil@@ ly shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , than the vision that she was once described in their collection , to reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old club of articles that is called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after their ground , she threw the audience with Kus@@ sh@@ ames , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes became und@@ ou@@ bt@@ ful .
as it concerns , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old man &apos;s 19 @-@ year @-@ olds got a whole new meaning in the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in the car when listening in the car
according to police reports that were released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot killed in one of the fatal attacks by Phoenix since one decade , while they had stopped in the car and heard music .

mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ processor : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his age@@ ing , Edmund Micro@@ processor , the result of a genetic disorder , who knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I will do that .
I do not create it .
I did not let me down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course one has dropped to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund she may never see them under circumstances , and that he may not survive any time .
some doctors went so far so far that they beat him to institutions .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a hearing aid .
Edmund could neither sit nor cr@@ ush@@ es up to his third year of age , nor yet he can &apos;t speak .
but he makes slow progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund conceived for &quot; Please sing something in front of &quot; me . &quot;
&quot; we bring the language language to him , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical character language -- says it . Edmund has found some characters alone .
micro content has a variety of causes : genetic like at Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the c@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life of the c@@ ik@@ av@@ irus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional prize of a certain future .
I asked , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still doesn &apos;t know .
I have not been asked for a long time since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone really can tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several bul@@ locks , including in the l@@ end , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at his transport in hospital with consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his little body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ en@@ dez to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was critical in a hospital as a critical and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boy divided the transmitter that it is expected to be revi@@ ved again .
he would like to start the first class in a local primary school .

investig@@ ator C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cruci@@ fix between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced back to different assault ri@@ ots , have been gra@@ ded to the facts .
it seems that there are clearly in the struggle for a continuous struggle .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I am under the women &apos;s ol@@ ym@@ pi@@ g in the Tower and that is from more than a reason .
first , since 1984 , I &apos;ve been in every summer ol@@ ym@@ pi@@ ade and the US were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ves , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired by many young girls of other skin colour inspir@@ ing .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ olic , is round , makes it proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
there has been the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this kind of sport .
in the last four years , the number one was under the female gym@@ nas@@ ium in an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
for the last Olympic Games he was a surprising Olympic champion in Gab@@ by Douglas .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ic@@ ulture rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual men , who won gold for women with an individual multi @-@ event event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but so you don &apos;t see turn@@ out classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympics can only have four tur@@ ers in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a train@@ ee .
but the reality shows that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and is Turner at first line in private s@@ orting , which will arise for training , income , travel , travel , clothing and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) , and the list can be obtained as arbitr@@ ary .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , the Turner first received their whole training and this is a most expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started with the tower since then .
we need to meet the municipalities of Au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an efficient and light accessible turn@@ around .
I founded my turn@@ around for 20 years .
with my events we have ordered a free and affordable gym@@ nast@@ ics in Harlem for more than 15.000 young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) and trained national and international winner .
in September , we are expanding into Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high quality sound quality to learn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and destination for the spirit .
this combination offers life benefits for health and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the Tur@@ ns and this is great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic Team Gold and thank you , F@@ ass you motiv@@ ated so many young girls with a variety of background motiv@@ ated to get healthy , strong and successful young women .

the ministers hop@@ ed to end the dispute concerning the changes due to acceptance of a re@@ formed contract with the func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants who were at a election , refused him .
in July , Hunt plans dis@@ closed the Treaty , and said that the N@@ HS would have agreed to &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for employees and patients .
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care about time periods .

this happened to the word of a man who had made Jeremy Hunt last month , that his door would always be opened .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must now act , lifting up and wor@@ ries the concerns of assist@@ ent . &quot;
if he do not do this , the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to perform additional working struggle .
the last strike at the end of April saw nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 termin@@ ations , since n@@ urses and medical doctors have been involved in order to provide doctors at the stri@@ k@@ post chain .

Daniel Mor@@ eno , Director General of the N@@ HS Employ@@ ees , called Assist@@ enz@@ sts to end the strike .

thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug , after being recommended by the authorities to submit more people for a longer period of time .
the ger@@ inn@@ ine medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons with a heart disease .

culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves elections in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was established last year on the request of a government report due to corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to them that the widespread election in Muslim congregations will be igno@@ red like a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacked the police , election observation and Rath@@ geber to ensure evidence of election abuse because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belie@@ fs regarding eth@@ nie and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and municipal government , who is now a ant@@ rup@@ tive King , said that the en@@ rol@@ ment of voters from religious Mot@@ ives so bad that it should be allowed to protect the police outside elec@@ toral cabins , to protect di@@ pped elec@@ tors .
he recommends that voters should lead to prove their identity in order to prove their identity .
at the moment , a voters must only call his name and address .
the report proposes that no rem@@ n@@ able ink will apply to the finger of a person if they vote their elec@@ toral vote , to prevent someone twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it calls for the press to have more access to municipal services and decisions by no official report or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s not only against election , but should also protect the municipal government in front of the wider correlation of corruption and financial statements , which leads to protect it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets toral sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a Special Court decided that the official mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should act after a lit@@ an@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Tribunal found that Rah@@ man would have had the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ ur@@ ism at silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ev@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doubt or the result of a re@@ spiration , when one person cho@@ oses another .
Sir Eric said that it was all the country &apos;s evidence for fr@@ aud .
he expressed himself in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - for the older members of the Muslim community had made up people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , shown , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the fo@@ xes to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof , pressure on protection needs had been exercised by some ethnic minority groups , especially women and young people in order to elect in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or Albanian background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a concerns that ... state institutions such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belie@@ fs about Eth@@ nie and religion were igno@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to produce the system , including the prohibition that political activists are edit in order to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elec@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , drawn by Ther@@ esa May into consideration , also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the constitu@@ ent directory for immig@@ ration and social bet@@ ru@@ gs .
options to consider , voters before your selection according to your identification .
no rem@@ n@@ able ink on the finger of a person once they have given their voice to prevent that som@@ eb@@ ody cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications on an automatic letter code .
ban , that political activists will process complete letter and envelop@@ es of correspondence .
the police give the powers to create bar@@ ns around elec@@ toral stations .
a Legislative Decree which facilit@@ ates an indictment due to the repression of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Ord@@ inary Code 1983 ) .
photographer banned in elec@@ toral stations .
request that only English can be used in elec@@ toral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees continue the rule alone to go through the elec@@ tor alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amaz@@ ingly , &quot; after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy head responsible for a lit@@ eral and illegal practices was declared un@@ certain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on a number of reasons for in@@ sufficient - according to the high requirements in the criminal procedure - found guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ises the effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of elec@@ toral registration departments of the Rath@@ geber . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is wearing a proud heritage as the mother of the par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ al spreading of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio is this week about the French cycling team Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot apart from edge and band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ ten@@ ant of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is not far the only one , around gold fighting Ath@@ lon , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if you must give the social media of faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time on our screens F@@ lim@@ b , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ on@@ ics that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s famous times .
the H@@ unters and Wolf : team member of the US team at arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling race , many people on the internet stood on how a certain she@@ et@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team at arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after pictures , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the arch@@ ers won the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave it to hear that he looks like Leo in his childhood .
&quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity , with the exception of the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , &quot; Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a high @-@ looking guy , so I &apos;ll get it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will be und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly the focal point of this year : the remarkable simil@@ arity between the British expan@@ sion@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular Ac@@ tor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should be considered a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cub@@ an American singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one speed higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; of the index .
another continued comparison was made between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ ba@@ the skin and bl@@ asting hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian of fans became a &quot; athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; at the same time .
strong women : football star Hope Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial form and eyes
not the only one : an Twitter user was very happy that other things are the simil@@ ar@@ ities to the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
theory in the room : according to that user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of Pa@@ ares perhaps a reason
&quot; &quot; &quot; an Twitter h@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet think that Hope and Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Hope and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar fac@@ ial form and eyes .

the network ow@@ es quickly and gave a message .
we regre@@ t it right that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast them .
we felt at night fast in our audience on the con@@ sign@@ ment and our fol@@ l@@ n in the social media .
to declare one , B@@ yr@@ &apos;s comments are based on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ adequate and a un@@ happy chosen formulation . Byron does that which he said , was very sorry .
on Thursday morning , Mac@@ Donald stayed in the con@@ sign@@ ment and tried his re@@ mark to just@@ ify himself , that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .

she said , &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
in the midst of the sale space , it took a pair of sub @-@ tro@@ users from the out@@ lay , moved their own strings and tro@@ users , and tried them .

how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ em@@ .com could make it a little saf@@ er for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ sions in New York to find out how to move with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you se@@ ver yourself from the front or from the back you will show how you turn the sp@@ ear for your rob@@ bers .
if you hit you from behind , then you should turn out as a result , so that you can see your attack@@ ers , and &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knees into the strip and turn , while the attack@@ ers shot off pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move on back@@ wards , while the weapon will move on him .
when attack@@ ers , who are approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon , and turn it , so the attack@@ ers can not shoot .
put the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle before they move on back@@ wards and destroy the weapon upon him .
sounds difficult ?
check out the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is with a rob@@ b on the saf@@ est , your money is enough - if you don &apos;t have Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .
travel Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide to his tongue in the dirty places of Europe
a British Reis@@ er sub@@ du@@ ed his immune system and saus@@ ages of a serious examination by taking some of the most tast@@ eful and most of the most poll@@ uted places in Europe .
the present@@ er and it@@ aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , out of Suff@@ olk dis@@ closed down its course on a euro coin , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
before leaving each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer for himself and to show us what he is going to let .
but the experiment , which was lab@@ elled under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; some surprising results were in daylight .
the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a pulling toilet , which was already used by thousands of other uses , may be completely dis@@ able but actually , in a kitchen sp@@ aw@@ ns more poor bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke of doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he took away , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of its gut by becoming the world as well as such as wonderful things as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to railway stations up to r@@ ins@@ om@@ bs of toilets , the task set its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively in@@ wor@@ ried about what my health concerns and I put all possible things in my mouth , Earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ ud@@ ge . &quot;
in the film he became a reputation for his reputation .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pros@@ thetic line showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometric hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to feed her L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands have a less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of various places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes to the worst thing which I smo@@ ked in a toilet , close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;m not an@@ gled here because it is in@@ car@@ cer@@ ely here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Cross &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company uses Mr Wright with Vali@@ d Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
validation Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
something that fascin@@ ates the fascinating and the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics is explained at the same time .
we performed mad Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which ended so we said &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intest@@ inal health is to be a global phenomenon
instead of only talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we were able to provide the consumer for more information on an interesting way .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me lose my respect for Ian , if he had tast@@ ed some of the things I have instructed him , like the ec@@ el@@ ful Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there was things that it was easier to bring Ian to bring them up and others , where this was rather difficult .

A@@ social Family destroyed front of Del@@ og@@ ation of Social Apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a family of genocide left her social apartment after a del@@ og@@ ation with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because they had terrorist their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and their partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in a repair condition .
the walls poured out holes on the walls were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was decorated to the walls .
the family were moved around and it is believed that they now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it feared not to repair the flat .
she said , &quot; It was here an absolute album here and I am the view that people do not have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , as this property is probably considered as a beautiful part of the Corn@@ wall .
the family is inf@@ am@@ ous and her reputation is also .
the pair had three sons , the meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police told us that the terror , which had added the family , cr@@ ushing of residents , drug abuse , drugs , and exc@@ essive reading , stre@@ ches and curse included .
sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behaviour in June .
in some areas of the house , which is torn down under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found .
in the property where drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past , the wood ri@@ mp@@ s have been torn
neighbours therefore said that they had to fight on the road and had to be called the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ed them and their partner this week , after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to go out voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours , they said that their lives was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they seemed to be ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was bad .
the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood here because it was so quiet - that &apos;s not usual !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family would have been forced to co@@ operate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the left side of the communal house , tr@@ l and old toys were thrown down .
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it was the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing continues .
that was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be terrible for her neighbours .
I guess all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church , have gone to us and have made the information we have made .
I hope that this development will receive a few neigh@@ bors who will not toler@@ ate the message that ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons were at different times in the house , but they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress located in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ etion left on the floor
workers of the house administration will now be we@@ ath@@ ed gar@@ bage , that sur@@ round the house
in 2014 , the police carried a raid on the house and found about 70@@ g of cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ her@@ al@@ ies and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ don received a fine of money after it was found guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in trade show .
it claimed that money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in 2013 in a car accident in 2013 .
after being without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner is now going to live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ymouth .
a lot of room walls of the house were awarded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will not hold Mi@@ xed del@@ og@@ urt , which do not keep to the house rules
Angela C@@ row by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall distributed that Del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ant that do not keep to the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who can think themselves without self @-@ form@@ ations , as well as those who have been off@@ ended by such a behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal behavior , that continue to work with partners to protect our municipalities .

Donald Tr@@ ump dre@@ amed ″ great problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. rep@@ ublic@@ ans will pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , also in traditional conservative States Parties to their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave the weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the past republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment , in which the normally large @-@ track and self @-@ resistant mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported such as concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the republi@@ can camp from the race , the Zweifel we@@ aving his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have massive problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked support of major federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
false reports are false reports about his candidates , he took up his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can floods W@@ ack@@ ing
Ut@@ ah is normally a safe bank for Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , said Tr@@ ump and his competitors from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
as end@@ anger@@ ed , Arizona and Georgia are considered as end@@ anger@@ ed .
in an interview of the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question as he had to stop Clin@@ t again : &quot; just as I have made it so far . &quot;
and if I say : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t make anything else &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not rich for him on the end of reasons for the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is ok , and Tr@@ ump continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump is supposed to submit to the support of his election campaign , it should not be able to present any better conversion values .
instead of whose wool , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are stronger among the arms .

I would say that we really have music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older child .
she reminds himself with mid@@ wives with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptionally !
and then there would be mar@@ ia personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I am Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I am Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is smart , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .

it is so honour for us to work with her .
she is an imper@@ ial man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ments : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in all its movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is so a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a more southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a che@@ er@@ ful approach to life , that &apos;s really important at all !

Turkey : Kur@@ dish municipality counts with mass acc@@ urs@@ ing
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and get Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Presidency of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish congregation of Germany calcul@@ ates in short term with tens of thousands of protective seek@@ ers who fled Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; believe the band@@ age of Ali top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard execution of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish municipality expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reck@@ oned with ten thousands of ad@@ mi@@ ds , medium term with some hundred thousand ad@@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime fighting the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the band presi@@ ding Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had passed the Kur@@ dish high bur@@ ns with pen@@ alties , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey .
after the failed coup , the sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks were added after the failed coup .
many are to begin new in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that himself took refugees , in his own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff accused the targeted approach of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities .
in order to increase Erd@@ og@@ an on the transfer@@ ring pressure to the remaining cran@@ ks .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were already exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CDU member .
the German government demanded that the federal government was positioned as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany , a &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; can also be held against Erd@@ og@@ an critics .
in the last months I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle .
the fire mark@@ er as Gü@@ len supporters destroy teachers and other academ@@ ics .
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and get Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Dialogue and Education , the world . &quot;
as an appeal on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already announced the biggest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany in front of the coup of political persecution in Germany .
as at the reporting date June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all have been recognized as as@@ yl@@ ated ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
this survey cannot be found before the war , poverty or le@@ gi@@ ance pl@@ ess@@ ness .
asylum seek@@ er after the Basic Law are exclusively polit@@ ically , so from state side , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : &quot; where to go where it does . &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ky Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : the nati@@ ves get nothing of summer campaign against - and the holiday from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Parliament .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern they understood .
in 2021 the Parliament election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the German Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
it is not so far as to date : summer holidays , heat and landing battle - that &apos;s the case .
the loc@@ als that are to be impressed by the f@@ ishers are on holiday .
most of the holiday , which are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not a native , so may not choose the land@@ day .
practical problems include practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ per , the posters hang up , air bal@@ lo@@ ons , flyer and dis@@ counted in the end of the vote .
until September 4 , 2016 , the elec@@ toral and final school day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern has to pass once a election campaign just under the people .
the hot stage , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , since 1998 , is the strongest party , clearly behind the CDU .
exciting , how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and remains at the end of the end thereof .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and heads of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees his grand@@ parents .
he travels through the country , spread Ros@@ en and pl@@ au@@ ght a little with people , as it did already become his legendary , former predecessor , Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise he has got cold feet to get cold feet and gave German Chancellor Merkel the bl@@ oss@@ oms of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rise of sp@@ op@@ o@@ ists will accelerate what it is thought to cost him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its peak current data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how to make the right place for the right place in the right place .
she has invited twice in German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s headquarters is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vor@@ p@@ ommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there too bad anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel will listen .
otherwise , the North East @-@ CDU sell largely on the usual elections on market spaces and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ l@@ las and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
that , as co@@ ca@@ ine , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the Union also noticed that you ro@@ oted on the country the base , that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people again .
you are as the left hand , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the times of the country scar@@ cely there .
however , the Council of the CDU @-@ fighting Kok@@ ert to his Mit@@ stre@@ ite is also sel@@ f@@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; they must go where it is we@@ ary where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .

B@@ 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment : catering facilities suffer from pl@@ ywood
at the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated , there is nothing to m@@ ise .
the construction works started at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and until 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is all@@ enth@@ al@@ ous praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made everything quite tasty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south at the weekend of October , until the end of October will be all ready .
the work will also be responsible for the construction of the construction work , around when it comes to setup of accommodation .
since the construction site was removed from Monday to the south , and also the pl@@ umb@@ ing of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has to be relaxed in the resort .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic through the place seems to be back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief executive manager Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ ar@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many battles sought and rather trusted in their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ posts .
what about it led to man@@ ver trucks in residential areas .
since the speed limit could not be observed , the municipality intensi@@ fies the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable exceeding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King that made herself on site about the location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are already two to three per minute inj@@ ected .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 km / h in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has been continued , but it was quiet .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
business people don &apos;t have to look at the cards .
but that the B 27 restoration of them has led to revenue in revenue , everyone who asks are asks .
however some more and some less are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for those who have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end client &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for which the rehabilitation has hardly been made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also that of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drive of course is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most poll@@ uted along the streets are the streets along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
that is already threat@@ ening .
not just him , but all guest rooms have it &quot; hard hit . &quot;
it lack@@ ed the customers of H@@ ech@@ ingen , bal@@ ingen and red we@@ dge .
we have to be happy about each euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenues remained far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street work was thrown by two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release the half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , policy would have been re@@ acted .
instead , government statement Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it would answer a financial balance , otherwise stated by the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now they also have to bear the dis@@ advantages taken by the restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other rural districts where something generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to continue .
finally , the family @-@ run company has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other words are less frequent , less frequently due to the complicated traffic leadership , can be understood .
if you don &apos;t ride , it is also what is nice .
after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt about it .
despite the cr@@ ises with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ long history .
six months of construction work , that is brutal already .
constantly , in the name of the terrorist control of laws .
according to recent debates , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a car status to do with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ al@@ an partner says to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
all his proposals are polit@@ ically perc@@ ei@@ v@@ able to be polit@@ ically perc@@ ei@@ v@@ able , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package .
she ur@@ ge them .
other , further points would be discussed at first within the parties .
I also took part in it .
but in the Minister of Interior , he was lying on results and on a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; within the Coalition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mai@@ zi@@ ère took a little while after the youngest attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before being presented his conclusions for the safety of the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they are now more extensive , but the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced that a new safety authority is to worry about the cra@@ b of encrypted communication , is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on air@@ borne data and tru@@ ce law .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not sur@@ pris@@ ingly sur@@ pris@@ ingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the part &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mai@@ zi@@ ère &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will start a second start @-@ up for proposals to date with the SPD : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to make sympath@@ et@@ ting for terror@@ ists with punishment and jihadists having a double citizenship to the German passport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be more difficult for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream of the CDU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still can do this for reasonable and challenge nothing , what if the Ko@@ al@@ tic partner do not have any chances .
a few new ideas present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also .
they have in part in itself : it is planning quick procedures for deportation and more possibilities for fail@@ ing people in front of deportation .
refugees that are targeted specifically to the country are supposed to check out their smartphone and check social media accounts for a security check .
in Dul@@ ce for the past asylum seek@@ er , he wants to act some worse than to date - such that pen@@ alties , or their papers are aware of their identity to swal@@ low their identity .
a lot of it is polit@@ ically and legal un@@ cle .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the ine@@ treatment of Ged@@ ser@@ y for example - the question arises : what does that actually mean to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it &apos;s not possible to speak in off@@ ence that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
there are also many people in view of high refugee numbers around the safety .
and things that people are deeply bowed down now in election events now .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the in@@ safegu@@ arding is large .
and yes , there are elections .
Union and SPD ev@@ ic@@ ating itself increasingly in position with the topic of inner security .
in the last days it passed between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ er dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Unions of Interior , where the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is concerned here to reconc@@ il@@ able sounds here .
from a return of the double pass , he will not receive anything .
we tast@@ ed the discussion in Germany .
you are re@@ for@@ gu@@ ards , unless otherwise useful .
and at a Bur@@ ka ban , he had given constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package at all corners are constitu@@ ent and whether it is really &quot; zum@@ able , &quot; it is necessary to show itself .
it is a lot that could cause war .
but the SPD also tries to pro@@ filing an internal security on the topic of internal security .
Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only a careful talk time and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still going through .
despite the diesel engine , increase delivery worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs around .
during the call @-@ call there is verteb@@ ra@@ e to see a term .
Volkswagen will rest@@ oring the deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s biggest high@@ ways can continue to continue despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , thanks to its many marks and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW weaker in Western Europe primarily in Western Europe and loaded the total sales to be recorded in the D@@ ax .
the VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries of deliveries are almost a sixth .
brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , in some core markets , it also changed its economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit was loaded from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the US , where the emission of exhaust gas analyses first , there is also a Min@@ us to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the primarily affected house stamp of the Lower Saxony will continue to continue straight through the diesel engine : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition from 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
Group leader Fred Kap@@ pler continued to present a sales split from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated with a software setting tests .
in Germany alone , VW will call around 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW , the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles there is no fuel consumption in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus stop to the customer after upgrading a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but talk not from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty as it was written on Friday in corporate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason to legal gu@@ ide@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted his German customers now a guarantee for the diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by the Federal Office for the last Monday VW representatives .
from the traffic department , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fulfilled the editions of my investigation Commission and the KBA Commander in its first time . &quot;
&quot; deviations of these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has taken the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after upgrading no deteri@@ oration , and all typ@@ ing deliveries are unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
in the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility of having an example of half a year after upgrading to a engine damage in a workshop - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do so .
also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is nothing to do with any other damages resulting in any failure regarding possible warranty claims as it was called .
therefore , VW use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; not .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands of rich savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
ban@@ quet Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros to gi@@ ro@@ - or daily tickets . &quot;
the German Association of German Ban@@ ks speaks of a case and does not see a signal : normal savings would not be afraid to pay for their au@@ ster@@ ity pen@@ alties . &quot;
banks Cash over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you have to pay 0.4 per cent of pen@@ alties .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or day monetary policy .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 is € 400 in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been over 40 million euros that could be withdrawn from one day to the other and could not be understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank@@ gesellschaft is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at my central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the bank@@ rupt@@ cy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can not apply for every million 4000 Euro . &quot;
the cost is now on after the course of the principle .
the cash is easy to leave in the Tres@@ ors of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t work yet the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most clients would have understanding and changes to other investment forms .
only few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB caused considerable costs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they alone to bear , be &quot; operating economically permanently not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for cont@@ acting , credit cards or transfers .
the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger country had made head@@ lines for three million euros , with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch offices in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , managing director of the banking Association , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect to pay private clients to pay for deposits , in addition , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks have to be much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a cliff , which is a little l@@ ush from the fortune . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you watch for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no other banks known to calculate a compensation set for deposits by private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go to neg@@ atives over the private client is very high , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition was hard , and it dro@@ pping the emig@@ ration of workers to competition .
customers in Germany are not left in the width .
destination : who is buying sound records ?
lon@@ ely men love middle ages .
before you submit to the comm@@ ent@@ aries to over@@ pass it under the pseud@@ onym non @-@ sam@@ le@@ gen@@ sam@@ ic defect @-@ ages with smo@@ kers , this statement is derived from the current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most recent re@@ formation of Schall@@ platten is not back on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als which we want to welcome the re@@ power@@ ment of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life @-@ nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a record are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
indeed , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely K@@ äu@@ ble group .
there is also no hor@@ des by ho@@ b@@ by@@ ists - it has a emotional meaning : older record buyers keep your feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report in television , I would follow me the camera , while I live in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest gray op@@ ho@@ ist and wild sc@@ uli@@ ers , before I understand my hands and tell a little effort as : &quot; so , let us throw away a closer look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slow to its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the building where once independent sellers have been resident - there is a hand@@ ful of fantastic record business .
I would probably ask the camera system to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I by S@@ ister Ray ( data ) : two young women , three men mean age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight males mean age , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and proceeds through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , ask me ?
&quot; I guess &quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4.000 records .
this sound records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by him ) , clo@@ the walls of its living room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy sheets , that he could not aff@@ ord to buy objects when he appeared and again to buy objects when he was young and ple@@ a .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late &apos; 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought to buy something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is true that those who want to buy the records are more toler@@ ated and glad@@ ly spend this time , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v @-@ profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have caused itself to buy their old records again .
of the convers@@ ations that I have led , people usually have been emp@@ tied to their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers that were once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; says he .
that would explain the boom of adding a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like Phon@@ ica to detect that plate stores a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ is@@ als .
according to We@@ z some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of confi@@ ded sound plate , from objects , happy to watch the happy hour of youth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or ownership of the property owner as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is with me as a collectors so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; sol@@ dered a employees from a plate stack .
a survey of IC@@ M published in April , that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month they have not yet heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , have no record players .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I bl@@ ended through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , the sounds of the Uni@@ verse ( number of people : three men of middle age ) works , has a &quot; t@@ rophy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone booked only recently here and said , &quot; I have no record players , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate , so that I can set them into the shelf . &quot; he says .
this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive loads , less musi@@ c@@ tures .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who only enter slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound records almost a whole floor , has an underground audience when I pur@@ ify .
there are pairs about 70 , tourists who take photos , teen@@ ager and women of medium @-@ ages .
even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest Syn@@ thesis and sex@@ tet pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ens from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such dens@@ ities at the customer .
none of them looks strange from them , but n@@ ag@@ ious psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard @-@ able if one stands for about 30 seconds next to someone .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been around for some minutes in the store and considered the Vari@@ et@@ ics of the plates for sale .
it rather makes a sh@@ ov@@ en@@ closures than a large purchase .
they deser@@ ves no much , therefore the Colle@@ cting of sheets does not say real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from one computer or in other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a del@@ ight@@ ful sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of record players have to be inspired : urban Out@@ jam .
while I give the ticket that je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teen@@ ants who group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left you will find a staircase full of plates , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics that essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees her - maybe because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to deal .
it is pure &quot; Record Art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction is doing more money for the industry , and for some customers could send out some customers into the depths of So@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates .
even if my research results showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v will vote , at least in sheet stores in S@@ oh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record players that exist in reality , record stores and in On@@ line@@ for@@ ums .
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the st@@ roll through the st@@ roll of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while the star@@ ring view of an un@@ secret , 30 @-@ year @-@ old Moder@@ ator , who rises nothing at the shoul@@ ders of the middle age .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demol@@ ition from shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French dish is rejected by the authorities of Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , in the thousands of refugees living in Cal@@ ais .
in a trial negoti@@ ated this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional businesses within the camp , including cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ lic , sell hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or easy meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would be paid in parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and the risk of fire and san@@ itation of fire .
humanitarian groups distributed to the court that businesses and restaurants are important because the free meals that supported by the state @-@ supported Association and other groups are offered , not enough food for growing numbers in the camps .
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops , but also revealed that the concerns of Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture are absol@@ ved . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food shops , cafes and restaurants would be playing a lot more important role , than just people live in extreme pre@@ conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of calm meet points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the re@@ mor@@ sel was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is currently operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a advice on asylum procedures for the hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to true the kids &apos; Café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closing &quot; for those children of a cat@@ astrophe would be , of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of Mig@@ rants on Friday that the number of living in the jung@@ le room has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ lingen during the summer .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hold further the World Cup at a glance , remain confident and continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 year old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his ma@@ stered twel@@ fth place at the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ est@@ ly told it , the time to comment by yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must analyze in peace , which had caused the reasons for deb@@ acle .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany R@@ aser must set itself on the next generation of speed better : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested to effectively transfer the speed lighter .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on the highway building or to san@@ itation bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide with a stationary bl@@ ender for compliance with a speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : its battery lasts five days if the case data will be transmitted via a modem .
with laser technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously over several tracks .
variable speed limit as well as feed rate after time , driving strip and vehicle class can also be seen .
in the highly resistant state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with a trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not easy to read , it is lowered into the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the pan@@ ze@@ es and by the way can disappear from a certain outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ ender in front of v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the data of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
there are also foreign authorities with the new technology : recently , France has made 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ way Rug@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ 7 Rug@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday night at a ab@@ rupt hold on the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back up , line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympics in every color .
the defeat was defeated by the non @-@ bad consol@@ ation prize - Great Britain - Great Britain on that day - and they could easily be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall on them in the final .
however , Fi@@ ji would have put a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form .
it might be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not be - that at least a brilli@@ ite will have hanging a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chief trainer Ben R@@ yan , the former boss of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind themselves .
eight years ago she lost any game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this fl@@ ap is we@@ ari@@ ed , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began to recover and left the attacks of GB@@ S .
it felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , when you run to running buses . the World Series winners went from 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au arrived in the corner .
with four minutes of playing time Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner of which he walked .
scar@@ let 12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly hit the ball .
a strong t@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to get a third gate , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the Res@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou &apos;s deleted by another weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji , when Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while the GB still wanted to run .
so it is too .
GB introduced basic changes to the half @-@ time , and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a Br@@ illi@@ ant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton started a try for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long enough in favour of the South American , whose fans sang and d@@ anced at the Tribun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the game approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame replaced the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff @-@ ön@@ te , the Fi@@ j@@ is im@@ pover@@ ished and the GB are sm@@ ashed down in the grass .
earlier on the days Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 , and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a close half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half of the front , but Dan Norton pier@@ ced the line with an impressive foot and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late Tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and thereby the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the cancer of the Train@@ ers
there will be no emotional gold than with these games and that will be hot .
from the first rowing until the last , 220 tough H@@ ieve that go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning took an additional significance in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only those who were sitting at the ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was also present at the second Olympi@@ ad in succession , the first women in the history of British Sports which had a scale of such a scale .
your Domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ proposed use , which is also an exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant Athlet@@ es that gli@@ des over the surface with elegance of spon@@ ges , which does not reflect the kind of Tri@@ umph@@ al .
behind each Gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ al@@ ion that contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that account the difference and it was no one of the trainer that would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and what did they do .
if you don &apos;t do it , he spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a rather serious situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could be early in early 2014 , out of season , could begin with the interrup@@ tions to a minimum if this is the correct term .
I needed money , therefore I had to go better again .
it was a inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it starts .
the rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it a bigger one .
in the un@@ medi@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a home in the morning with a little more than anything , and trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was the cent@@ ur@@ ion at the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was a emotional wreck . this is maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin have worked .
we were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would have no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person for train@@ ers or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race during the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the past 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had much in reserve .
we were very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it is really important to leave not away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not able to make something of rab@@ ies .
we wanted to have no fire@@ works , we wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding next week , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now you just wants to enjoy the moment .
I would not say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years old exempl@@ ary for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ Group &quot; group , R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is considered &quot; Bavaria &quot; well . &quot;
a small fresh water @-@ purpose drinking water purpose as model for large water producers .
it was the name of the Bavarian Radio in front of a couple of time .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ fran@@ ken joined the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the group companies sailed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ n Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert was set up as water wart in 1985 and was appointed Chief Executive Officer in 1988 .
&quot; its duties are very diverse and they looked at the water pipeline and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the budget of charges and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ person .
as outstanding events they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the farmers in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ creation of a central computer controller ( 1999 ) , and the re@@ visions of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) and the sub@@ divisions of water@@ lines .

he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he called the well @-@ fabri@@ cation and restructuring of the association .
however , the greatest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ vot@@ al sl@@ ump in the church with a loud voice on 3 January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to pass through , so the villages can be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be applied once , because you filled the can@@ ister of P@@ ett@@ stadt with s@@ ling .
the management of drinking water purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who dates from Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s office .

steel - View for German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional cost in millions of millions .
financial burden , which the industry threatened out of green electricity funding , are from the table .
in the Liberation of Renewable Energi@@ es in the German steel industry , the Minister of Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) said Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the West German general newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to insert steel producer , the gases from the high furnace for electricity generation to demand their own demand .
according to the German industry industry , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of EUR 120 to 240 million per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a principle of principle with the EU Commission after talks with competition un@@ disp@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ . .
only when generators can be replaced in steel plants , all an EEG conversion of 20 percent will be replaced .
but these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on their own power generation .
thus the status Quo of the previous regulation was written largely .
special significance have the successful shipment of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emission standards , climate and employment targets are weak@@ ened , &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel sector in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis of 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy when the world &apos;s biggest producers in China surpassed the global demand of demand on the global market .
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel @-@ concert price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
at one point , import duties of import effect on impor@@ ter effect , to others have increased economic prospects in China .
it is un@@ clear , as su@@ stain@@ ably the pricing is .
the German industry prim@@ us Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained carefully on Thursday .
last@@ ly , prices would have to be stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the sector re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp recently wanted to exclu@@ de closing of individual works .
at the end of 2015 around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July the German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced approximately 3.4 million tonnes a good six percent less cru@@ de as compared to the previous year , like the steel association of economic steel on Friday .
after a brief increase in May the recovered amount now returned to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production is reduced by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association calcul@@ ates in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
fellowship , spirit , health : singing seniors
the singing has already accompanied her whole life : as young girls she has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an seniors choir .
&quot; sing to me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels a balanced , mer@@ ry and a total of alive , says it .
very next to her health and mind doing something good .
for singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , who says Erhard Hac@@ kler von der German senior liga .
most of the seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music , Hac@@ kler .
through the regular merger you can connect the social contacts and maintain .
because often social and family structures in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also taken Ur@@ sel K@@ Tip in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to discuss and organize himself on the others and to learn of one another - a choir is a very special form of mer@@ ging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sing can sing in the positive sense , Hac@@ kler wants to sing .
because his seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever calls his lungs are regularly requested , but in everyday life is not so fast out of the pu@@ rest .
even if it goes to get the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Urs@@ ula L@@ enz is part of the Federal labour community of senior citizens .
in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a lot higher place , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure time , explains them .
L@@ enz is often observed that the singing or listening of songs with older people are we@@ aving many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth time .
through lyrics and especially melodies , de@@ men@@ tia people in long returned events .
in addition , the head requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , focus on their own voice and to adapt to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone , do not only focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one goes through the singing in the choir , Hac@@ kler writes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em grows by the singing in the choir .
even I will show yourself : if I do something for something , I will better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with the singing , so there are enough .
who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he wants to have little talent , L@@ enz L@@ enz .
you do not sing alone - at 50 sing@@ ing people who list@@ ens to , if a sound comes next to it ?
in search of the suitable offer , seniors have several possibilities , says Hac@@ kler .
if anyone sing out of the circle in a senior ench@@ y@@ or , you can easily connect .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surroundings .
he who wants to sing in a church choir may take directly to the church or church officers .
a lot of seniors can also be found on the Internet .
who doesn &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask help with the Internet .
whoever desires to sing , should definitely be connected to a choir , at Hac@@ kler .
the soul will sing well and has something good . it is true for each age .
cats react sen@@ si@@ bler than K@@ ater to cri@@ mp@@ s of the young animals
bi@@ ologists studied in Hanover , what is the effect of Kat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals .
at her surprise , the male also did not get cold , however , they remained in the difference to the female always .
female cats can recognize the exc@@ itement of cat bab@@ ys at the roof of the little ones .
they respond more than ten percent qu@@ icker to Lau@@ te from K@@ itt@@ ens , who chose to have found themselves in great distress , as scientist of the Medical University and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cr@@ ater also react to the streets of K@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the ten@@ ds of less and strongly prov@@ oked young to the males either perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Con@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is first authorised in the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ rous Biology &quot; .
in a previous study the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens is differenti@@ ated with the drums of their help .
a total of nine adult male and eight bul@@ ls were observed from the animals of the MH@@ H .
to them were played by the saus@@ ages of little ones , which have been taken for three minutes from the throw box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
at other words , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with writing of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which was also elevated in addition .
the researchers hold their results in spite of the small sample for sa@@ w@@ mill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every female , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted differenti@@ ated on the cry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned off faster to the speaker when this ru@@ ff played the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be an@@ tic@@ ulated or developing a sexually mature with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the male respon@@ ds to ever , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noise .
some studies showed that women respond sensitive to babies , quite similar if they already were mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .

especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who served as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ que , the basis for the 14th title .
this is the reason that the fans will continue to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , the AC Florence , under contract , and Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as had announced only l@@ é@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return on the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario should come to us , he must only say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club@@ Chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;

others over@@ led Athlet@@ ics sinners can only laugh at about - they are fighting in Rio by medals .
the topic d@@ oping determines how the head@@ lines among the Olympic Games in Rio .
Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who compl@@ ained in a d@@ oping re @-@ lock its start quite shortly before playing games , was dra@@ g@@ ged out and hat@@ ched at their start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it was a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a raised smile it was still in the hall already in the hall and prov@@ oked with their performance .
as a festive , they could not get gold , the audience broke out in a Jubilee .
but there are many other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start despite the d@@ oping past in Rio Olympics .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversi@@ al figures in athlet@@ ics .
he was closed two times due to d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his leg , the Olympic champion from 2004 and Ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it &apos;s more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds , the number one in the world and is regarded as the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the second consecutive Olympic Champion and seven @-@ times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .

Per@@ kovic fought the wi@@ per taking and was closed for six months .
the four wid@@ est th@@ rows go to the account of the big gold f@@ avo@@ red in this year .

a means to penis enlargement is been responsible , served Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 metres far from the world &apos;s fastest men .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ole , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes have been recognized as many medals .
so , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after that test@@ osterone d@@ oping was diagnosed .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give the Olympic Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of test@@ osterone abuse .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also recognized by the International Criminal Court for the 2008 Olympic Games .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he is on rank two of the world list .
Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km ) , China ) : the world record woman and gold f@@ avo@@ red was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , not@@ ices were found on taking a banned dietary supplement , the sperm of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA was mil@@ dly and ran already on July 13 .
bomb error in Thailand - Austri@@ ans viol@@ ated - more dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öll , Friday morning .
they have been overcome , and be treated in the hospital , but I have already left this again .
your home trip is planned for the beginning of September .
whether from other explo@@ sions on holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on , also Austrian national are still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in permanent contact with local authorities , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a b@@ ypass district .
according to the police , a Thailand were killed in Thailand and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
on Friday , two jumps went up again , so according to the authorities , another man was killed .
also of Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
at the Det@@ onation of the popular Cour@@ stran@@ ds of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured by police officers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities in a flower basket in front of the re@@ four of the coastal police into the air .
finally , called Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ phe on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
you go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , was called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks contribute to the same hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army @-@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to make up possible mot@@ ives , however , it is likely to change the works of Muslim reb@@ els .
also Thai media wanted to recogn@@ ise a sample that is typical for the attacks of the country of mus@@ li@@ stic separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
however , on the contrary , the Thai police declared , the attack was not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement of movement or with the international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age that limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said one spokes@@ person in Bangkok .
it rather go out that bombs was laid down by the ruling military j@@ unta .
in the past few days , the authorities would have been confi@@ dential information on im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact date and the locations .
yet be un@@ clear that group behind the attacks .
the police proved their officers in the whole country to enhance security around important government building as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement area .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually don &apos;t judge for tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used by King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j in Thailand .
after some serious bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at its homepage to make the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high level of safety ( safety level 3 ) , for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
according to the disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , they are not necessary to travel in these provinces .
elevated security risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday performed a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on a constitution issued by the military j@@ unta .
this spatial influence is also a major influence in the past few years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said , the bombs be an attempt to sti@@ ff chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , holds himself to have gone back to stability and order .
however , it did not succeed to the military , in the extreme south of the country , the insur@@ rection of mus@@ li@@ stic reb@@ els have been in the handle for years .
more than 6500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago in Bangkok , there were also been killed in Bangkok with a attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; is advis@@ able to the vis@@ or of the Federal Office of constitutional protection .
after several coun@@ ties , the Constitutional Court also referred to the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; responsible for the freedom of democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , Zu@@ w@@ anders or from the Middle East become diff@@ am@@ inated in extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore we observe the movement now .
the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
she turns against &quot; multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; un@@ controlled mass immig@@ ration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity through overseas . &quot;
the constitutional complaint in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said that his authority have voted closely with the country &apos;s decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; ident@@ ities &apos; try to pick up their target group , where she is , &quot; said the constitutional protection .
generally , extrem@@ ists trying to address them with young language , often with p@@ opp@@ iger music .
the Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ists as did as right @-@ wing .
this is no noticeable advertising for his own thing .
the prop@@ aganda must speak emotional .
young people are due in special manner .
that is dangerous .
recently , from several federal states reports about contacts of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; to the Af@@ ak policies .
Ma@@ ate said that he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type only be relevant from a certain point .
it comes on whether the relevant party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons that are extrem@@ istic about their target direction and so extrem@@ istic .
the decisive factor is that such persons control the influence on the party .
this is not visible .
with a look at the significant increase of just@@ ification and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee institutions , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context yet not of new rights .
but we &apos;ve found in recent years that it can be just@@ i@@ rous structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday Group .
it can be quite good that further just@@ i@@ ror@@ ist group or small groups constitute , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing mot@@ ives .
however , a state @-@ wide or European control of just@@ i@@ ror@@ ism is not visible .
the existing groups were built on the regional level or in social networks .
wor@@ ried , Ma@@ ate expressed that many over@@ take on the account of people who did not occur in the right scene in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the facts in attacks on asylum are not known as crimin@@ als , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or tra@@ ilers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed offen@@ ders who had nothing on the hat , who were maybe polit@@ ically in@@ different , or for example of the CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who , however , have been radi@@ alised with right @-@ wing invent@@ ories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used to inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic and world records the head@@ lines among the Olympic Games .
it shows the bra@@ ve appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that he could no longer see in TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the section was selected .
in the social networks , Hab@@ ré was then moved to the vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a response of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 starters .
but it was rather his just sporty figure that moved to the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special car from the international swimming federation .
this is distributed to swim in underground countries .
since most athletes are running in Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ies , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
fast made the first peak name round the round .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosper@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ leaf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made him funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle , played there no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; have also been drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i run for medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from equ@@ ator@@ ial Guinea when he had to take alone on 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle .
fr@@ en@@ et@@ ically was fired Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old took place just eight months before the Olympic swimming pool and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

&quot; &quot; &quot; should it be done with the election of the U.S. President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already become an alternative video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he turns into the vacation .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , would be either fold , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US television channel CN@@ BC .
if it is not rich for him on the end of reasons for the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is ok , and Tr@@ ump said .
thus , he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist mil@@ itia Islamic State ( IS ) .
at least in his party , more resistance was formed .

Mr. Hartmann has been on the GfK @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruit of the restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last poor GfK figures , each share of the shareholders will be sometimes in@@ quiet .

accidents - Bus non@@ slip in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ns in Gr@@ um@@ ps : eight Ver@@ sions
with an accident of 43 seniors as a travel agency , eight people have been injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( district Aur@@ i ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police with .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the Bus@@ ses of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to withdraw their data according to an opposite L@@ aster , which went down on the counter@@ run@@ way .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a grave , as a spokes@@ person for the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance wagons and a emergency vehicles arrived at the provincial road 2 .
the distinctive traveler were brought back by a line bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ble neighborhood .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ator demanded the load driver and possible witnesses to report himself by the police .
the fees for each cubic metre of wast@@ ew@@ ater will be available from October 1 , 2016 for the se@@ wer@@ age of Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World Heritage 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2.@@ 18 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
in the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will increase once again , when corresponding improvement measures will be necessary .
after exc@@ essive lim@@ iting the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that the budget was approved by the budget of the budget together with Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these san@@ itation systems sub@@ missions .
the Cas@@ endorf market is oblig@@ ated due to legal basis to operate the facilities .
from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ fare ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will need to take deeper into the money bag .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Herbert Schmidt on the board , a new cal@@ orie intake was necessary for se@@ wage plants of the market town .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ l@@ - and covers from the previous calendar period will be compens@@ ated .
the engraved con@@ cre@@ ator Enh@@ anced Schmidt thus making it all three se@@ wage plants by relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage fall , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters each year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for a necessary repair of several thousand Euros would be eff@@ ected .
in addition , the se@@ wage in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining .
in the past calendar period , all three installations are not last fallen due to their age of san@@ itation and repair expenses in a significant extent due to their age .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt argu@@ ed that Az@@ endorf had to be replaced mechanical ventilation system due to a damage of damage .
in the pump cat@@ ch@@ orus , the nearly 20 years old conveying equipment had to be overhau@@ led from the ground and after almost 20 years of operation the first har@@ dening pond had to be installed and an additional ventilation option can be installed in order to maintain the water regulations in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to these extraordinary expenses , the continued care and maintenance costs were to be taken into account according to the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 clearly below the current level .
stone houses clearly showed that in the low se@@ wage fall into the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
in this case , complem@@ ented Schmidt , the market town of large entertainment costs in se@@ wage plants in the past 20 years has remained spar@@ ed .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ ari@@ ous , especially since you could not expand the supply of se@@ wer@@ age group Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to extend this facilities , because it is a qualified facilities .

when this week some U@@ blade introduced a filter that gave them stro@@ kes , false teeth and evap@@ or@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called an rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ lowing of Asi@@ ans . &quot;
they asked whether these repet@@ itive contro@@ vers@@ es had to be reduced to a larger problem that the company has di@@ vers@@ y with di@@ vers@@ ity .
the news and the indig@@ nation were spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and the motherboard , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have been de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered a exc@@ use : the filter was an homage to An@@ ime characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ standing , the rac@@ ism of R@@ ass@@ is@@ sm@@ us , remin@@ is@@ cent of the filters of the viol@@ ate cl@@ ams .
others were op@@ ted to the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , an Korean @-@ American art student , whose highlights were widely used to viol@@ ate the filter &quot; viol@@ ating and gel@@ inde was un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the counter over@@ lap of a highly controversi@@ al Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not sufficient , but that the yel@@ lowing of the yel@@ lowing is pulled down .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural proud .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ y and integration amp@@ f , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we keep all in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are in the things of race with various as their older counter@@ gam@@ ers - could rather be expected to expect Sen@@ si@@ vity .
when one of snap@@ shots is produced , it is much more difficult to stay for a user when it was earlier in the case , &quot; the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to delete their Snap@@ chat account , others to do the same .
in a phone interview for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that r@@ ots @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ es reflected a lack of di@@ vers@@ ity at the time of snap@@ shots .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ized the part of the large part white , only male leadership and finished her attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either did they have no different representation of people with other skin colors , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or feel good to tell what about to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , an appeal to the Snap@@ chat mainly has left .
the company has published no figures for di@@ vers@@ ity of his workforce , and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat began to discuss the cultural reasons of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently set a staff responsible for concentrated population groups and on internal integrity issues .
Zh@@ u told you , that they will be closed to the Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military guide ra@@ ges IS@@ IS Secret Services Information , introduces committee on the Congress
as a result of the United States Central Command , the United States Central Command Chang@@ ed information about the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it permits the actual conditions on site , a report of the Congress held on Thursday in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the dispute regarding Central Command Intelligence , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Secret Services , reported that reported its estim@@ ations on American efforts in the fight against Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News Information Information , which were typically reported by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , signed a position on terrorism , as it allows the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services , quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com , is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leadership , Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the Cent@@ Com exec@@ utes ranges up to top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed issues in the years of 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the Iraqi Army .
although there are no direct indications that government pointed out among Obama signs , it shows how anal@@ ysts were subjected to pressure from their prec@@ epts , an optimal image from the threat of Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress was significantly higher than it corresponds to the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com members publicly known that a military retreat of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq remains under control of Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the months of investigations , it is as much clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Kansas , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the news reports to retri@@ eve the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after giving them to them that anal@@ ysts had wor@@ ried about manip@@ ulation from reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge during the investigations .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com Reports by the General Inspec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence in G@@ ange .
the news of the news portal published on Thursday have published their own knowledge that coinci@@ des with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created a revised process for the creation of con@@ scienti@@ ous obj@@ ec@@ ess@@ ments to I@@ si@@ l and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the highest ranking democracy in the committee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Ship , in a opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , such as the ship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of news reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mor@@ al under anal@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave slightly little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats agreed to have no evidence on a intervention of the White House near Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts on a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times was reported by investig@@ ating investigations by the Pentagon , which were taken by Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press brie@@ f@@ cher of the Pentagon , gave an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress during the Ministry of Defence .
but he also gave &quot; experts sometimes quite di@@ ver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot;
an investigation on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of the last year , however , was the question raised to what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ our@@ able military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the critic@@ isms concerning the Islamic State recall disc@@ ern of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a writer of many anal@@ ysts just watched a small occupying troops in Iraq and had a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker issued by Mr. Hoo@@ ker after expl@@ aining government claims to have no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group , because this provis@@ ion@@ ic refin@@ eries had been put into operation , in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ aging commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ized by members of the legisl@@ ature for his superior positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field of hockey of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memor@@ able performance but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she couldn &apos;t remember that they have ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep your gates in memory .
however , this knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition , and are in their group with the British in the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will hit the first round in the last round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two will receive six teams from the first and second place .
the first @-@ placed case will leave the strong Dutch in a little longer from the way that lead the other group .
as always the game may go out , the Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story , four years after it landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ comb in hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national playing in the United States , the most recent in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympics in 2008 as they could not qualify for the k@@ ader .
then came the year 2012 in which she was shooting for her and her team .
in the subsequent year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to use the things for better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of cultural change , a mental change and a body change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work in London that we now have .
we can completely pl@@ uck the ru@@ der completely .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a retreat from the se@@ am area .
India had gone without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team was sur@@ pris@@ ingly tough and kept the playing level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter that took the game in their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the sh@@ allow ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ de the ball in the gate around the US a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez managed the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of all the tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to date a goal in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will the result of the next game is on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ably , a fast relay switching between competition and streams .
it is , when the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning rod that will protect the wrist@@ s for the tri@@ athletes for the tri@@ athletes .
you can not turn to the tv , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the qu@@ ake , without Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the battle between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Logan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a Black Sea with dimples , would definitely be sent to the Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ being TV advertising when he would have a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame doesn &apos;t illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade there are sports types that are not generally accepted : aerial guns , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming , and may have it a long time .
but if I would like to make certain arguments for my certain lovers , then let me leave the attention to the discre@@ et charm of tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had made his debut in Sydney , the last 16 years had been so anno@@ yed that many of whom I had asked , did not know that there is an Olympic port@@ ability at all .
that could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ ms .
although the United States sent an athl@@ ete for competition , it never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had an athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it until the final round .
the Chinese and Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ ines jump a certain outside side char@@ me , partly because it sounds for an un@@ solved ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a little enthusiasm .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ ons of his never too wanted ri@@ ver@@ ing - but also the Gra@@ zie of the Turn@@ ens and Tau@@ ern , which un@@ ites two sports .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; originates from the Spanish El trampoline , which means that as much means &quot; trampoline board . &quot;
emerging vic@@ tor jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost to 30 feet into the air and have a number of falling movements ( turning , real and salt ) before going on at the feet .
according to official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ gram , you will be rated as soon as version , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ ons must go on in their stre@@ ches after gold , faster , upward and dr@@ on , sometimes even to the finish , sometimes move and back , down and down@@ wards at the playground .
they are not only ch@@ ase the line line or the starting wall , but in the TV transmission , also another highlight : the world &apos;s or the Olympic stadium .
the goal @-@ targeted Stre@@ ets is Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic , and it &apos;s enough to stir even a viewer .
but it &apos;s too , what I can look at this games like something .
of these , the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ un@@ ned , seem@@ ingly heavy duty like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , then moved to the top , then moved back up again .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant repe@@ aling of time and gravity .
it is as Zen like the competition for the Olympic Games .
the qualifying and en@@ dow@@ ns of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 .
N@@ BC will illumin@@ ate the du@@ ck as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who will probably see in general tum@@ ult .
when the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by the attack@@ ing and the obj@@ ection of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting to rein@@ car@@ ing his new fan@@ club .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ant &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a Verb@@ ose of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , demand political changes in Ethiopia , shooting down the violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that the protest@@ ers were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in Sch@@ uss@@ aud .
is Ethiopia just going to break ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable states of Africa , a solid of Western Europe with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months , the protests against the government had the country and far exceeded themselves in more areas .
last week there were thousands of people on the streets and the fundamental fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was in@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave that polic@@ emen were shot and killed un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , the video above the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , will show how security professionals hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the UN CEO of Human Rights demands a detailed analysis now .
&quot; it was always difficult to stop this land and will even be more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated to be the west .
American military and intelligence services collabor@@ ate closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror beyond the region , in particular in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , so much western help .
Ethiop@@ ians business expanded in a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new P@@ end@@ ler@@ suit in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even when Ethiopia was anything as an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continued the op@@ pression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , and dis@@ sidents were effective in silence .
many were put into exile or put into prison , put them into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth were Protestant .
a generation Protestant .
there are numerous complaints which cover everything from the ground up to the sp@@ ouse with regard to power of the government &apos;s government .
after a far critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition , and control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time st@@ resses along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for these z@@ ack@@ y , controversi@@ al line called in June hundreds of lives .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less explicitly in recent years , could protect the tur@@ bul@@ ence and themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of the pro@@ vocation after years of age shall be explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media , as cheaper smartphones have been more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government turns access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , can communicate many people still over Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies , which hide themselves .
several young Ethiop@@ ian argu@@ ed that they gathered themselves to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest Eth@@ nic in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not a natural enemies .
since Equ@@ al prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , which origin@@ ate from Ethiopia in East Germany , in politics and economy , during which the Oro@@ mos explo@@ ited , of which many Muslims are living and live in flat areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are involved with a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population , and who are dominant in the military , in the secret services , in the trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ ad@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on an un@@ sealed disease in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia , Prime Minister .
he was viewed as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man that could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct that it was particularly standardized in this , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special privileg@@ es to edit your opponents and make them ir@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing in this fundam@@ gen@@ ius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , C@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
other than Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Tyrol , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fears that the result will be more blood shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections , according to the information published by the government , apparently , and then stolen from the government .
while the following Raz@@ zi@@ ans were killed , many protest@@ ants were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and that time the un@@ rest went relatively fast .
development experts praised Ethiopia leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ suit , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but obviously this is not the intensi@@ fication of internal mis@@ ery of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and they take a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , protest@@ ing in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , by Tig@@ ray , and the hat@@ red towards the tig@@ ray in the social media is still pract@@ ised in the social media .
analy@@ st predi@@ ct that the protests in the USA and other Western allies are present in a separate position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights about the neighboring Somalia , even if they had recently signed that it closed this base .
while the West is clear to support democracy , he does not want to merge his ban in a already vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin but migration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement by Obama in IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that his campaign rev@@ oked his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously .
this clari@@ fication designed new questions concerning the communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ s of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to communicate whether it is capable of communic@@ ating and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings together his Mit@@ stre@@ ite , who ende@@ av@@ our to accept him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , which could not have to declare that he could not meant .
after he had made the clear@@ er at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump was made reference to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insi@@ sted that it was really not intended to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in a early morning on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cop@@ ic .
in contrast to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the debt relief .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to destroy the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy the republi@@ can candidate for nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism on Mr. Tr@@ ump down , while he tries the focus of his campaign because of falling conversion values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ t would result in higher taxes , and that he found their speech bor@@ ing .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July , he moved with strong criticism , when he thought that Russians would love Mrs. Clin@@ t emails , but later he said &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ eth@@ ical . &quot;
this approach allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic borders in politics , and then back to ru@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages of his fans will be taken as they arrive , and then , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who watches the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ age enough , so that they can be interpreted in various kinds and ways .
instead of the tone for the Presi@@ dential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump adopted an even corrosive tone , since its response has declined further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , who was published on Friday , showed a lead with a great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is trying to do not have to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort or understand his declar@@ ations .
but while he is strengthened in focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze his loy@@ al Mit@@ stre@@ ite into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be made .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps prominent inter@@ c@@ ession , gave great effort to defend the candidates this day in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements question@@ ed if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization that he called her back@@ ben@@ chers , completely wrong and so it happened , because he withdrew the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainst@@ re@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to ar@@ gue that the government minist@@ ered to Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an Foreign Minister , it allowed IS@@ IS to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and threw their attacks on each of his words and vo@@ ke against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he missed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , un@@ u@@ chs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats review about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use me as merely a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential authorities .
once more about the price of the market , cafe in Green@@ point is coming back
ver@@ b Cafe was a scar@@ cely cafe in William@@ sburg , where one could only pay cash , that no Wi @-@ Fi had a good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed back .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , put the b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
local loss occurred as the last loss in an opposing city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ o wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a soap business . &quot;
but when New York is change , it is also new fin@@ ite .
a lively Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than one mile north of its original location .
the new g@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money for a new foreign office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept many things .
the same distributors for excav@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ sur@@ ing machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wi@@ ches are with bac@@ on and cheese and there are yar@@ ns such as cap@@ ers and auti@@ stic onions .

the café is no beer more , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed an st@@ ained current of old clients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were pushed forward by prices of William@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited Ver@@ b regularly .
even after that she was drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the way to themselves .
after the ver@@ b closed , she gave a while the coffee t@@ ines , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and in the day that was pleasing to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they put on this day instead of the usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees and ordered a bl@@ ended C@@ hai &apos;s Tea that is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loy@@ al customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before his work and ordered to the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came close to seven , every day as a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment with new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal can still get his usual order , but sometimes , he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he does not make sure that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold w@@ asting coffee of the caf@@ és as access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on their offer again &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish map and Rodri@@ guez , he said that he soon found her to present her new neigh@@ bors .
the site has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally would like to fill the cold white coffee in the bottle and sell for sale .
there is a chance that the café is expanding into a neighbouring building .
a new ver@@ b is sufficient for many customers to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was De@@ ed and said that he was destroyed by the ground when the Café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt had decided to join the location of the local coffee and the best coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming in coffee .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pri@@ ming food of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano took Roosevelt in the O@@ val Office .
President Roosevelt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water signs soup .
his menu on this day was somewhat more modest : co@@ red eggs in tomato sauce , potato m@@ ashed potatoes and Des@@ sert a pl@@ ump p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an act of culinary solidarity with people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey , &quot; from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man tells the life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
her newest co @-@ operation , &quot; A contin@@ ual meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ iss at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a virgin cheese with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn , with potato pur@@ ée and mixture .
when the re@@ porter ordered h@@ ack@@ ers , this imp@@ acted the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of great depression .
rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were formed from a ingredient and some cheaper that stre@@ ak the access .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male workers and it was fresh b@@ aked , served as breakfast , lunch and dinner .
they were the Americans who sent food to hungry during the first world of World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; distingu@@ ishes the roads with which the country was surrounded , no longer to be the slaughter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans , a central , donated Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ ary diet was the new Bud@@ get@@ ary : mysteri@@ ously food such as bre@@ ads and ch@@ asser@@ ules were used for basic food , the c@@ asserole dish recovered , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , as Kö@@ che un@@ appet@@ ite ingredients could hide under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dr@@ y@@ ob@@ st .
meat , the heart of the American kitchen was , became a rare luxury .
independent mixtures were tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ cal@@ orie and nour@@ ish satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research on the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a court of this ep@@ och , b@@ aked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; there was no more popular accommodation at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
as never before or since then , household management - including Louise Stanley , director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating hab@@ its of the country .
by using recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines published , they encourage women to become &quot; House@@ hold Mess@@ ages &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals to be justified .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration for historical L@@ eck@@ erb@@ ach .
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farms in his kitchen , he sp@@ elled like the billi@@ on@@ ous man of the world , to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ o@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ gilded dining room and wore a tu@@ ece .
he was del@@ ight@@ ful real@@ y .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mist@@ akes , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate with his stomach .
as described in the book , the an@@ cho@@ oses of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt , revealed that the White House prepared the bor@@ ing food in Washington , but also one of the most frequently prepared food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression , with food , was rejected , once the country came back onto the legs .
the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on food was applied .
the pair was given to the writing of the book the eating hab@@ its of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law better - for example , as they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of waste food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alls : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were the wind@@ shield .
after the plates were removed at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled out and cover a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um , which had lunch on Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick was modest recipes to miss a send name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no failed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped something like a spo@@ ons in the t@@ una , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
you don &apos;t miss it bad .
CO@@ E was repeated three times .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ er , he said to his wife , &quot; A couple of chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to men in Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died for a bombing raid against the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civilian protection group that saved the lives of nearly 60,000 people according to the picture newspaper .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game to move people out of frag@@ ile houses to aff@@ ord the first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of civil protective , which shows him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the luminous symbol in the grave of the war .
however , as heroes he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me this is true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think God think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter have cast four cl@@ amps over the Alz@@ adia District , one was filled with chlor@@ inated gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of bombs , so that not children playing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dead@@ ly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ ist is almost 400 years old
more rare view .
Greenland is usually only in the winter on the surface .
after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna was allowed to return to the sea .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and s@@ wimm@@ ers with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie has only been getting married for 150 years .
the Greenland &apos;s ground is the ground of the North Atlantic coast , an average of 1.@@ 220 meters in an hour .
only when it comes down , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal accelerates to a massive 2.6 km / h - and it is very fast as fast as a seal .
this of long lon@@ el@@ iness lifestyle seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues are reported in the journal Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland , the 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ graphic research in Rostock this lif@@ esp@@ an , which means for verteb@@ rates a world record .
indeed , the ev@@ olu@@ tionary biolog@@ ist thought that Greenland is a long time of Greenland .
only lack the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s hair is difficult to observe , finally , they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea before the th@@ in@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually occur at the surface usually only in winter .
researchers know about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle accordingly .
their period of time emp@@ t it , when they spread six animals with a transmitter in front of the S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
spoil : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a seal , another one had swal@@ lowed the pine bones of a young polar bears .
possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for Kad@@ aver , those from higher water layers down to the bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 at Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard as a catch @-@ off from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long while the largest 502 centi@@ metres measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the liner core of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises from the birth of Ha@@ ie , which the proteins contained in the proteins later will not be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
therefore , their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear cap@@ tions try greater amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in the smallest size of 220 centimeters , the liner core contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 of the nuclear weapon , it is likely to be celebrated its 50th birthday at its test in 2012 .
in their lens core , normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts to normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 o &apos;clock showed a 4@@ 93 @-@ centi@@ meter @-@ long Greenland an old age of 335 years , while the b @-@ shar@@ k with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old .
that Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only got to get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age .
since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably determined on the threshold for sexually mature and his age at 156 years of age , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie leaves the majority of at least one and a half centuries .
this is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland , whose bac@@ on on the neck is a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ pointed tip , was captured in Alaska .
due to low temperatures often the organ@@ ism of the living animals often runs out there .
so they turn later - and al@@ arms slower .
in order to keep warm water in cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than one gram eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives in more dangerous and should focus on it as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the ev@@ olu@@ tionary biolog@@ ist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should be investing in a long life in contrast to its resources .
building site in double pack
with topics around the building , the municipality in the youngest session took part in the most recent session .
with relief , the Committee adopted the notification of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported residential cultivation can begin . &quot;
after the plot of land , par@@ cel@@ eration and er@@ aser these applications could be clari@@ fied and the sale of land in the residential areas called &quot; road @-@ road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section of Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) is nothing more in the way .
the community is convinced that the be@@ l@@ acks are pre@@ valent in rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and equi@@ voc@@ al seniors alike .
as it was called , you can report construction consent from now in the town hall , over the awarding of the plots to be advised in its September session .
in order to obtain further requests concerning the res@@ ett@@ les of other industrial companies , the municipal council decided to change the ground plan in the spring of this year in the spring of this year .
in the area of under@@ time lar@@ n , the commercial area is expanded by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city at the Main has been in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the best chances to attract jobs and companies in London .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ ited from Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands , leader of the Compet@@ fel@@ ds Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W .
according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is un@@ certain whether the money will continue to operate from financial transactions to the entire EU .
so far the approval for the so @-@ called EU pass is one of them so far .
that &apos;s just big US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to fight jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; will be charged with 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities as the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of risk ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its head office , but it was less significant for the financial sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the music bank is important for banks since they can communicate with the supervision of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg util@@ izes a large fund industry , sl@@ itting , but also how Dublin is worse in infrastructure .
Frankfurt am to be much easier thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the city with easily available commercial property management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , rent for first @-@ class commercial property is 50 percent higher than am Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the consulting consulting Mer@@ cer the city on No.@@ 7 , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European inland market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London , however , I will continue to remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it &apos;s vote .
the forces of forces : in London , according to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , roughly 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector in the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal control
on Friday , Hill@@ ary Clinton released their tax statement for 2015 , and there was a monthly income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ t USD 1 million donated to char@@ itable purposes mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton achieved a income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ t candidate for the vice president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax returns to the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue to focus on financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ t Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ pers in Jenni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i was known in a position .
in a contrast contrary to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hidden behind false interpre@@ tations and rep@@ lication in relation to his previous promises to publish its tax returns .
it is custom@@ ary for US presidential candidate according to their tax returns , although it is not oblig@@ ated by the law because of the law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax examination by the tax authorities as a reason for his ref@@ us@@ al plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the release of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps special advis@@ er , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax tests are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critic , amongst others also the republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already been able to leave his ref@@ us@@ al questions regarding wealth , his donations for charity and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton already fell on the subject and posted Friday a video on the Internet , in which rep@@ lic@@ ated Rep@@ ublic@@ ans Tr@@ ump ref@@ res@@ h to publish its tax return .
on Thursday , she also spoke about a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done for the last decades and publish its tax issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said too much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or less taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist in the New York Times quoted a series of tax ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ aries and tax advis@@ ers , who could still be the case .
Bundes@@ bahn are become a theme in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a control that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buffet that would make sure that people pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called the Buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ et@@ omer@@ ate here has his seat to exchange their tax returns to their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ets said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was also subjected to a tax inspection of the IRS and Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ t Campa@@ ign has returned tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ t , which now lives in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , we paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax statement of the Clin@@ t from 2015 showed that only USD 100 of its income was related as a salary , unlike the most part of all Americans .

after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel rec@@ ep@@ tion@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer which he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sent him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel asked that the measure has a deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski hotels . &quot;
the reason that behind it was , in the director , dis@@ band@@ ed more rage in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they demands that the pre@@ fix is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man named this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reported the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied from this event and crash@@ es .
this is really very faint .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even greater shame .
this does not need any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident recorded a quite big reson@@ ance on the internet , where people had called a sc@@ and@@ al .
some of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel agreed that there would have been listed for the alleged Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was noted in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located on a cl@@ assy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly denied all accus@@ ations , and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , &quot; Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rising to 71 % - RT Business
with the repe@@ al of the sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran accounted for 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in sites of Russian enterprises grew strongly , distributed by the ambassador .
Russian enterprises take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to have access to the market .
of course , another trade show is one of the biggest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran during the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent , and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade change was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land @-@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian foreign governments represented around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily associated with Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries that the tourist number in Russia .
one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken out of the past year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civ@@ ilization in good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling sensation
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the Men@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ age , who had made his fellow man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . and he made the legend , when he stor@@ med into home to enter a win from the favorites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cked victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals .
she repeated the trick , after they will get a modest sixth place in London , despite the re@@ sign@@ age in March .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man when they remained , when they saw potential in the fle@@ ets , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the first four years ago with Ho@@ y won and Sk@@ inner sat in the qualification round one Olympics , but in the stand@@ ings , the New Zealand won the first round .
and the British Trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap was almost returned , but Kenn@@ y brought the team back to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a major part of the transformation , where the Hin@@ des in a higher gear , to slow it down and it &apos;s Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert in and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they rose to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and make me a name .
we set a Olympic record in the final round and defe@@ ats the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
after the 2012 triumph at the page Kenn@@ els and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des that he fell into the railroad after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ections from England &apos;s rival .
this time there was no problem with such a outstanding victory .
hin@@ der said : &quot; it feels complete with the whole GB flags on the Tribun@@ e like London . &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we are so bad in so many world tit@@ els so bad that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation who won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a Bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape of Kenn@@ ys it is possible in the field of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would mean for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a apparently most holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the be@@ k of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
one can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something to win alone to win alone .
Hin@@ des said : &quot; if he wins two other gold medals , he should be sm@@ itten to the k@@ nights . &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day but there was further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ille W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ bles qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 942 .
the World Record , who won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place in the second day of the contest , with the focus on the W@@ ig@@ gins .
yesterday , in front of the qualification round , he fought against the qualification when the func@@ tion@@ aries had to be measured to measure its height .
in the respective female competition , the morning continued and terminated , Laura Des@@ p@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world war period in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB Team is leaving on his powerful platform team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a Sch@@ ar to medals .
after a truly outstanding representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations were lowered for Rio .
in the background , Dr@@ amas also played in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex and mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ ers , as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , if you see the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite afterwards , when the legendary call GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Portland , due to repe@@ al of the energy source
the future of the aluminium half of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game since the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , providing all delivery contracts , such as the supplier of energy companies .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to the plant .
a maximinum payout for 20 years expi@@ res in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the plant of Al@@ coa in Portland are on the game .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could end@@ anger@@ ed at a closure .
Moreover , it could come to Domin@@ ic effects , as the melting plant consumed around 10 per cent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa graduated the Point Henry Dr@@ ill , which led to the Angl@@ es@@ ea &apos;s closing ceremony last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ky .
this step follows the same long spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the system , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last year due to the current price .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium shells with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three further owner will announce their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ en@@ i Cor@@ p can hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland still remains operated , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melting means , &quot; shared by the company .
AG@@ L said that the contracts so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; will be in force starting in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on revenues in AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ating markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L divided the value of contracts already in his annual financial statements in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; Sk@@ ill Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melting , or ensure the power to the melting plant . &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have been able to enter into force in November of this year , even if there is still a statement , why it came down from the contract .
analysis of the bad economic conditions in the industry before the possible closing of the Portland melt plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ ti@@ cian at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts and Tom@@ ago about 900 megawatts .
if both plants disappear from the market would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as power generators , it wouldn &apos;t be good . &quot; he said .
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the V@@ ogue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the US V@@ ogue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ) , which will forget the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ On@@ eness and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ oo ) , as they will end the cover of her sister and with a classical winding : you have all a surprise party .
this makes the cl@@ ee@@ ee@@ zed hand nearly every occasion of a child call ( Se@@ ac@@ tly brought the proposition that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to attend to participate in this Public@@ ity .
with regard to the September edition of V@@ ogue , the new era of Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started with safety .
K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes them to have struck the V@@ ogue cover ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue is a league for himself .
the September issue is for V@@ ogue the most widely used issue of the year .
with a circumference that is rather similar to a fashion magazine , the output is similar to a fashion magazine ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling bearings 615 pages advertis@@ ements ) .
the unveil@@ ing of its Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to be ad@@ dic@@ tive that in the last two years of the magazine nor prior to official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
over the past few years , more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the mod@@ elled &quot; as &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jenni@@ fer Lawrence was born in 2013 in the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low probability that Ms. J@@ en@@ ner is described by the magazine as the &quot; Bur@@ ning model &quot; of its generation - under the former category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous persons , or reality stars or young people from today , know how to rot@@ ates a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything goes on to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like to everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always an@@ gled in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her name &quot; the mist@@ akes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings sal@@ ted boiling up again when the message came out with the publication J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue cover .
but on the mis@@ giv@@ ings , seems right at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the V@@ ogue .
it is the true sense of the word a super model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your site of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell your pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in their leisure time they can see in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centers have 16@@ 0.000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 visitors from the country will be rejected by the municipal authorities each year , while the industry made further over@@ load transactions to the effects of further medium @-@ cuts .
in Queens@@ land there are already three of five people - mostly older persons , immig@@ rants , helpful workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ real del@@ og@@ ations and similar designs - in their search for free legal advice and legal rights .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly util@@ ized , are preparing for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centers will lose another 30 per cent of their Federal remedy .
the director of the Community Center of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse due to the decision of the federal government .
&quot; Queens@@ land Municipal Cent@@ res are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people of important service you need to be rejected , &quot; said he .
people who leave the violent relationships , people with un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able and inv@@ iting debts , families who were dismissed by dis@@ closures - all these people have problems just@@ i@@ fying and this survey shows that they don &apos;t need help to get the help you need .
the federal government will cut its resources by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means thousands of helpful people from Queens@@ land will be forced to just@@ ify their legal problems with any legal problems .
we request the Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Minister and the Federal Minister as well as the trans@@ formers of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to reduce these medium @-@ cuts , so that people may need help to obtain legal problems with legal problems .
last year , the national government fulfilled their commitment to raise funds for sp@@ ens@@ ing on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the community centers and their customer @-@ communities , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first Smartphone
E @-@ mail and Internet in Tim@@ upe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the successor domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kg and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was di@@ cker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather t@@ apping .
the built @-@ in memory amounted to eight meg@@ abyte at the beginning , this would be enough for about two sel@@ ections with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros you can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they get somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet .
however , 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; Office in the West@@ ent@@ bottle format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the Communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser if also qu@@ ic@@ uous slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , an digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015 .
no one could take on in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the wise phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the mobile telephone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled by it .
today the market rule over the market today , which came in a lot later than Nokia .
always everywhere and everywhere , that &apos;s today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion units sold , on Samsung and Apple , 555 million units alone are sold .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this will come to the well running shops of the countless app @-@ provider and the telecommunic@@ ations concept .
around the Smartphone is a whole industry created in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World &apos;s introduction to the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and a Internet communications , easy to use with touch screen .
the winner of the Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the night .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry decided to fight .
the S@@ ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility for 20 years after his invention .
at the average , every German Germans sees 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must learn all to get the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , responsible for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must expand the Olympic Spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local municipalities and in the whole of London , but in the whole country of renewal and prosper@@ ity .
for me , this is the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row as at that time in 2012 in London , when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be back by putting new possibilities for local and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local churches , we will already employ 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as soon as they were in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement of He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ er had in@@ justice in 2012 and they will be wrong at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answered every question .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn on wit@@ ty growth , creating a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport as well as in whole GB .
we have been a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which was a £ 11 bn worth of infrastructure investment program in time and budget , chosen by T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport office until T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequency inverters .
now they are ready to deliver a third running time , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investments .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it &apos;s time to expand this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding display block
for companies that earn money with On@@ line@@ advertising money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle ad block and mouse play . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block the sco@@ ops on his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page , Ad@@ block Plus has published a blo@@ g@@ post in which it might be able to block their filters in the program to block the advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook informed that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coding regarding his advertis@@ ements to identify it displays that part of the page advertising is to be exhau@@ sted .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the Speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the pointing Open Source Community and the Um@@ bre@@ aches already exists since the invention of sco@@ ot@@ ers in the track , and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has dropped in the struggle for social media , is a powerful inde@@ z for this , as a result of g@@ aller@@ gen@@ ic sco@@ ops for the industry .
according to a study published by the last year of Pa@@ qu@@ air and Adobe will use some 200 million people ad clo@@ cks ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billions of active users of active users , who access to Facebook about their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ advertising and 84 percent of the advertising took Fac@@ ebooks .
the company has shown this ad block @-@ block on desktop computers , since mobile displays have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a speaker with .
advertising on desktop PC makes a sufficient amount of income , so that Facebook is worth to be worthwhile as a re@@ warding .
on Tuesday , Facebook informed that there would be his &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; to have more control over them on them .
on Thursday , Facebook tells us that Ad@@ block new filters would be found , because they would block contents on the side that are no advertis@@ ements .
&quot; for users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to discuss the problem , &quot; shared a spokes@@ person on Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication .

woman with suspected suicide on Swiss Highway
the victims was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call@@ eth witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a crucial self @-@ suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman took in the Dun@@ kl@@ es &quot; in a act of bran@@ ching &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police in Vau@@ d said .
it is obvious that a Swiss lady in the age of 49 , that of several vehicles , including a truck , over@@ took to kill himself .
she died on site .
several drivers were already taken , but some are still not identified , the police , who , as well as every witnesses of the occurr@@ ence , have been reported to report itself .
an investigation process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the driver will be displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
this is something that has to decide on the prosecutor , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to the responsibility .
in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the Dun@@ kl@@ es on the highway - was decided that drivers do not have to go out that a pedestri@@ ans running in the middle of the night , as it was named in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acquitted of the cas@@ ual killing after they had over@@ ride a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious of the road .
the Tribunal found that the police officer -- that had answered a not@@ ep@@ ad -- on a just@@ i@@ ent manner , and that the presence of a man on the street had a &quot; perfect exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
everyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should sign at the police in number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA chin @-@ up : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once hab@@ itable according to proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus in the use of tools and algorith@@ ms that resem@@ ble them of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 tight atmosphere was once recorded as a similar conditions .
scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be declared by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin but er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere could still rise slowly .
the model illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably proved more dry areas than the earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protecting rapidly evap@@ oration .
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS @-@ model simulation the slow rotation of Venus its daily side of the sun was almost two months long , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io explained in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like a rain@@ bow , to remove the surface of the bulk of sun heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degree cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus that resem@@ bles Evolution , which previously assumed by Plan@@ eten@@ ers .
although it was likely to be hab@@ itable , Venus -- were exposed to high heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned from ultra@@ violet light .
when her hydro@@ gen was removed only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect back -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate models in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy occurs as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a close co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as principal coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and reas@@ oning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of summer long and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , this is needed and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization &apos;s organization .
he must also have a co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , had than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me this decision on this decision , &quot; said Z@@ ic .
we estimate all what he did for our organization and wish him for the future only the best .

the re@@ mun@@ eration regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ ö@@ lar@@ er are suspended , while all the parties agreed on for a new talk round on the table , they said negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were produced spor@@ adic on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unions may confirm that we have united us to re @-@ start the winding process of current stream , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some full day sessions within the next weeks , which will start the beginning of the year to re@@ vo@@ ke the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market print .
the company &apos;s advice is followed by a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts into the company will be the required space to come through the market change .
Shell has announced for his part of thousands of people and plans to reduce his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as a result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us@@ al flow with the British energy company BG Group ratified it .
energy companies are based on lower cru@@ de oil prices under pressure , a economic situation that caused by the decision of the British in June which had reinforced the European Union .
the Scottish parliamentary member Dave Anderson met with workers in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work of labour which took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we will need an economy that works for many and not only for few works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea as compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the newest mission with Kepler &apos;s Kepler teles@@ cope has helped to collect the most complete catalogue on rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star cluster is rotating at different rates as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational areas of the formation of the planet .
we hope through the same of our results with other star cluster , more about the relationship between the mass of a death , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a Short news release .
the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 445 light@@ years away from the Earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach the adult .
you are now turning on the fastest .
to peak rot@@ ational rates , these gri@@ pping stars lists large quantities of stars .
since these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star switch off , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of every star by taking the time between the publication of a recogni@@ z@@ able star@@ cks -- such as sunlight .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , turning larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ters as smaller .
in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors have to be massive to be massive , while in against faster rot@@ ors that ten@@ ds to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ide@@ ological laboratory to compare substitute qualities such as rotary rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it &apos;s still much more than we would like to learn more about how , when , when , and why stars slow@@ down their rot@@ ational rates and so speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of the Rot@@ ating rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades that soon appear in the astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eball @-@ star starting from

after its emotional re@@ sign@@ ation announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be on 12th August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the tri@@ h@@ kot of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I tell &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; , the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ees .
his signature under a tenth year contract has been granted a yearly 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , it acts as a consultant and youth coach - at full content .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez returned a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Nav@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 - 2004 ) , and since 2005 he managed the Y@@ ank@@ ees .

for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field it was so controversi@@ al his appearance outside the square .
already in 2009 , the Super@@ star was called &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , the ster@@ oids had to be taken together .
in August 2013 , he was closed due to a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis @-@ Sk@@ and@@ al until the end of 2014 for 211 games .

Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are first d@@ op@@ ing@@ es
caught : because of a positive d@@ op@@ ing@@ sample , the weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski from Poland won &apos;t start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ att@@ ed by the first official d@@ oping cases .
a caught athl@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ es are known for the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
the Chinese flo@@ at Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter steep@@ le ch@@ anc@@ ers in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish Ge@@ weigh@@ t@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski were tested in Brazil . immediately before the start of the athlet@@ ic athlet@@ ic athlet@@ ics competitions this news will come to the accident .
in the past Sunday the Di@@ ure@@ tik@@ um hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ d had been proved , which is used as m@@ ask@@ ating agent for d@@ op@@ ing@@ sub@@ lime .
on Friday afternoon the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , just around 0.09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen had said to participate in the for@@ ging over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Chen has applied the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the national association take the matter &apos; very serious and demands by Chen full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we are working together with the International Sports Court of CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history is not more the IOC but the CA@@ S , responsible for the recovery of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio le@@ ak@@ age the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went away into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athlet@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said to act in the banned substance to act with blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ es EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was provis@@ ionally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive .
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow expressed himself with criticism of the Ath@@ en@@ ean athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men don &apos;t draw the right slaughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are standing under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all the weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter of the nation cannot participate in Rio .
on Friday also the &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; was known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested for three days previously positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
they both contest in@@ gest@@ ion , both may not be able to start in class up to 94 kg .
prior to the start of athletes , in particular , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic di@@ op@@ ings of the start , even the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya has been produced in Rio numerous bad news .
in the swimming sport , the former im@@ pet@@ us in China had also experienced violent strug@@ gles between the athletes .
the Fr@@ ench@@ man C@@ amille Lac@@ our@@ t handle the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun stood at the heart of a con@@ front@@ ation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping operations , &quot; said this .
sun was positive at the Chinese Championships in 2014 , positive on the ab@@ stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din but had to sit only a three @-@ month sperm count .
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ ack@@ ing her rans@@ om
program@@ mers of Er@@ press@@ ungs malware . currently , targeted companies and are successful .
according to a recent survey of malware infection , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes below 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were at least 40 per cent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months at least once , some times victims of a attack with press@@ er software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies were already target of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware @-@ press@@ ings .
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly offered by the perpet@@ rators , to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their press@@ ings software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes and to Att@@ acks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential @-@ to @-@ press release is significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching fast Evolution of the related software , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ le @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most col@@ oring programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the press@@ ant software for themselves .
only private users were the goal , but the change went to company neck took place in the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on the computer of an ox , she is looking forward to un@@ long modified files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos .
the files encrypted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
afterwards , the software presents the requirements of the press@@ press@@ ors .
in order to receive the final turn@@ key code , the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ n@@ ite Bit@@ coin .
but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , it is possible by companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls off when a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent had to break down the business operations in case of a case of people in life .
in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of acute acute disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not pay , you only promote the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , will get their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to under@@ go the demand of the perpet@@ rators in operation .
the h@@ acker again know that and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security for@@ scher of F @-@ Secure exam@@ ines the commercial areas and the contact with the pres@@ sions and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims by chat as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and they are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to pay partly hard negoti@@ ating and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s to return their data .
in view of the potential high and relatively ris@@ ric@@ ular winn@@ ings from R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware @-@ press@@ ings , the h@@ acker will always be professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski by the Internet provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
more likely , however , it is about three or four people .

one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ free
in the small HR @-@ V Honda offers everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty un@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V that has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz was actually proved to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V was rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the f@@ ond , it does not work closely .
the materials of the interior space are well @-@ processed and are comfortable , only the cockpit upper side falls there .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage space .
it is not only a trunk of 453 l at highly positioned and 10@@ 26 l when folded back @-@ folded back re@@ ject , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; .
this is less magical , than it sounds : the seat surface of the back seat can be folded as Kin@@ os@@ essel , and therefore offer storage space , which is up to ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high .
the boot space can be loaded well , however , the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he is likely to set out his work for a bit more quiet .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is very pleasing .
another engine is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the gift is expected to be direct .
in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; there is no desires to be desired .
to the safety systems the city @-@ emergency braking system ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and trace assist@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ isions ir@@ re@@ ates sometimes , because he has been rated at the rank of many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ al@@ izing objects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote assistant works very reliable .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to traffic sign detection and threatened the speed as required .
however , the full connectivity makes it only for the top @-@ features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and a HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
if you do not want to invest in such a lot , gasoline engines will receive from 20,000 Euro , diesel engines from 23@@ ,000 Euro .
the motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and all@@ stand@@ able car .

disease : when paid the organizer
after their journey only money will get money back when the cause of the disease is free of charge in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests stated the same symptoms show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case a family was difficult to decline in di@@ arr@@ he@@ a on the second day of its Turkish war .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ant on a def@@ ective cl@@ auses , which supp@@ os@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that was to be man@@ ned and def@@ endants with the organizer .
prior to judgment , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
indeed , the applicant was in fact faul@@ ty .
but the organizer knew just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to go out until then that sea@@ water was fine .
he did not hurt his information , so the judgment .
it is no im@@ pur@@ ities due to the samples of water .
several hotel guests - the condition of several hotel guests - a risk of infection with one another - is a common living risk .

&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violent crimes committed in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were wor@@ ried about other attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be so@@ ber and decided at the same time .
sure : our country will not answer the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rator not with hat@@ red and split .
we will not get the terror@@ ists .
when perpet@@ rators would have to leave the country around the country , but the safety and strength of the population is also the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017 .
he also announced another human ampli@@ fication of security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ digit size order over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ic@@ uous for terrorism must be under punishment again .
video surveillance is to be improved as amended by the weapon of arms that is worth the purchase of weapons on the Internet .
the most recently discussed silence for doctors is to be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the medical certificate , such as the haz@@ ard of citizens can be reduced , he said to the psych@@ ic g@@ ain@@ ly stories .
in order to maintain a radi@@ cal@@ ization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social assistance .
teachers have to be prepared better for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to eng@@ aging the use of investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior clearly pronounced against action against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear@@ nest for the hin@@ ge in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had pointed out from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double citizenship before .
a general prohibition of complet@@ eness , it is not legally binding for constitutional problems .
you can &apos;t find everything you can re@@ jects , and I bring down the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about rules in road traffic or for witnesses .

better traffic flow on the motorway zu@@ br@@ inger
it st@@ ained regularly on the Um@@ ber@@ straße - here a picture of November .
but that should change : the legal tender will be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in the traffic on the surrounding road every night in St@@ au , when you drive over the highway Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the state building extends on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) in the range between hammer road and the departure Wes@@ eler Road to the right @-@ track track by 700 meters .
drivers can then go directly from the hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself early in which the total end is improved on the widely used section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea of the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of the Münster @-@ West .
the bike ride on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nerv@@ ous , drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ day goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond that .
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on B 51 just before the W@@ eler Street departure .
from here the traffic is only guided through the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built over a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge has no longer required load capacity to absorb the heavy duty traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and so it is ongoing , the competent state of the state is not able to say .
however , it is likely to be reck@@ oned with years : for the bridge has an official use period of up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal entity , the state company has visited the traffic weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will be guided on the site on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the site .

rain instead of stars : hope to weather forecast
the weather has made the constellation Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the South@@ west of Germany in the night to Friday a st@@ rich by the bill - but there &apos;s still hope .
the night was not suited for clouds and rain , the chairman of the sky , said the chairman of the constellation Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we see many star schn@@ olls on the sky .
this constellation is Per@@ ei@@ den , who belong to the fastest stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they are apparently coming from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us which goes in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening one mat@@ ured for ever , at night it is time for hours of wake , in the morning there is no more difficult to think of sleep .
that &apos;s all others as relaxing .
after all , one is often with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adults sleep sleeping disorders and more than ten per cent do their sleep frequently or permanently as non @-@ relaxing .
how can sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there may be varied causes of causes , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society of Sle@@ eping Beauty and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you under@@ go down , but is the In@@ som@@ nie , so it is an entry and a sleeping inter@@ rupt .
just those who sleep through many people as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ sufficient , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German house medical association with practice in Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep distur@@ bed ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , mental or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medicines medicines .
not sel@@ dom is the sleeping expression of another condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking up especially with depression is often &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors may be ro@@ oted on each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and starts to gre@@ et , about everyday problems and ensure gre@@ et , gives We@@ e@@ ß an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should one do with sleep problems ?
who doesn &apos;t sleep well over a month of at least three nights per week and is imp@@ aired on the day , should consult doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ le@@ ashed , has difficulties with the attention and the concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has voting fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints like mag@@ or or head@@ aches .
in order to lin@@ king the sleep , it is important to find out their causes .
as a treatment options , in particular behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleep fats only in the exceptional case and at most for two weeks - in@@ query .
in Germany , he has hardly been emphas@@ ised in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
this is why one should not apply with sleeping difficulties at first to the house@@ doctor .
it can clari@@ fy if the problems have a physical cause .
who was to sleep in sleep , and what happens there ?
for an investigation in the sleep laboratory , for example , in case with breathing difficulties , for example with breathing difficulties , if you do not find the cause of a sleep inter@@ rupt , Fi@@ che has been declared .
it is not necessary to test the examination .
it should spend the day normal .
&quot; only do not make a lun@@ atic n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after dismant@@ ling you go into bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one of the nas@@ al br@@ ille is wearing a chest strap and a bon@@ der on the finger .
in addition , a camera also distingu@@ ishes the sleeping corner on the ceiling .
how can those problems get in the handle ?
there are quite many positions on which one can set for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular bed@@ - and standing times , not too long in bed , on the day do not sleep , not watching television to sleep , alcohol depart , and at night not on the watch - then it starts to count immediately , and that &apos;s quite and not eligible .

airport : ban@@ ked Bag@@ gage from Bag@@ gage
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the Düsseldorf Airport
civil society of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded on Thursday the capture of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the facts were committed as Ban@@ de several T@@ ash@@ - and Bag@@ gage ste@@ els .
around 21.@@ 30 civil servants recognised civil servants in the airport of Düsseldorf , a ban@@ ker that had known the polic@@ emen from previous theft .
the two women and two men had already committed several del@@ ic@@ te since mid @-@ July of this year , and were involved in a community and particularly professional .
the specialists of the crime miss@@ ariat 34 can di@@ versi@@ fy the di@@ ps of criminal off@@ ences to Germany in order to demonstrate four acts .
they took over 15,000 Euro in total .
old buildings , some Lin@@ den@@ baths , in between still a rest head stone : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works in the first sight not so , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walk along the road from east to west , one goes to playing places , a refresh@@ ing children &apos;s garden and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demolished , it is already built : by 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is called , but are illustrated in the last weeks with burning cars .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents of rent lease , on the ground floor , however , rooms have been occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the &quot; no @-@ Go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence since the beginning of the year .
on 22 June the premises on the ground floor , the cad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers were cleared , pat@@ ched the police three weeks in official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locking parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , in the order of the unknown builder , the premises of the unknown house owners had the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers went under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peace@@ fully : parents go with children , people sit on the brush in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about the late Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin we have primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; since 1999 , and J@@ ana * who draws three children above all from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects , they share the care before increasing rentals and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound right after a Kie@@ z , who wish to w@@ ander mostly from v@@ and@@ al@@ izing Left .
the tr@@ ench , which the Berlin Interior , and the police between house occupied and her neighbours , obviously doesn &apos;t exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional labor quarter , which also has a lower average in comparison to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty .
the residence and the native residential projects belong to the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR , including almost the entire mainst@@ re@@ am street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the mainst@@ re@@ am had been evacu@@ ated in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the quarter has become increasingly become the mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ toral liner from around the world , with them now share living from GDR &apos;s times and former house occupied its Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable in the rentals since 2009 , which has increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as a symbols for these development : they det@@ ects them in checked discs or fresh@@ ly kn@@ itted fac@@ ades , which were subjected to paint bags .
no other street often mentioned this year along with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ and@@ ome Viol@@ ence . &quot;
a reason why not all neigh@@ bors who have seen it as a problem , could be that they are not imp@@ acted by the crime of crime , according to statistics , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the criminal off@@ ences make in damages , the ten@@ sion@@ ally rather to meet the new@@ builds and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversi@@ al 94 , un@@ certainty can be no talk of un@@ certainty .
what is violent , they are weigh@@ t@@ orious : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who would not have been this .
even the famous burning cars will give it straight to the Rig@@ a@@ er for longer than no longer .
for who studied Archit@@ ect , her street is not a criminal record , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of one another , as elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has moved and remained in the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße .
therefore it was so important that the residents got their streets : from the police , the politics and the media that were suddenly taken place in July all the deci@@ ph@@ orus of the city .
however , in the eyes of the inhabitants of Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by sc@@ anned new buildings in former buildings that remains the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the con@@ domin@@ iums that are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not so good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction cannot be gu@@ essed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should I do if any man hear ?
as there are fru@@ stration on all sides , even by the police and the inhabitants .
for Zu@@ ge@@ zo@@ gens , who would like more than paint bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
anyone who draws , should be aware of it - just like any man , who draws up in a swe@@ pt area , po@@ or@@ ly compl@@ ain about noise .
all people only with pre @-@ listed people have to be asked to be called by their real name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee lecturer
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organis@@ ational measures .
also she is social worker on site .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee lecturer for Ur@@ bach .
the social educ@@ ator supports the management of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it can be regarded as the contact partner for all actors : refugees , workers , refugee aid , administration , authorities , and who else could still be mixed .
Reg@@ ine customer indicates that the volunte@@ er has been than@@ k@@ ful more than than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now , the wo@@ olen wo@@ ol@@ au , which has mainly a problem .
so , some - less sp@@ ott@@ est than rather to the multitude of wish we wish to ask for a multitude , as the administration wanted to write the position .
sought a administration of administration with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long@@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a je@@ al@@ izing wo@@ ol@@ au .
but administration of administration is not its central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le believes .
especially go to organisation , work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with this since approximately six weeks .
it has a 50 percent limited place on three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and the main actors supported .
there are great and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a heavy problem exists since some time , apartments for the connection of the connection of the connection that have been acknowledged .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection of the connection .
they have to place refugees in their own or rented residential rooms .
the cost of construction , the rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear commun@@ es themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Parliament and the job and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search have been designed for some time as very difficult .
de fac@@ to find the administration of no private apartments .
so far it did not work to have been addressed to private apartments , Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , we must be able to be contra@@ cted , as it is so beautiful .
so soon there will be new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in addition to a solid lead , it is an intern@@ ships , training places , training places , A @-@ euro jobs and aid workers for refugees and migrants who need to be spot@@ ted or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help home @-@ master@@ y , do @-@ profit @-@ profit work - and motiv@@ ated as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive outer effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
he is not only working .
the day require a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
the people would have to develop an in@@ tim@@ ely experience .
so there are offers such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and mainly language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so jump here administration and hon@@ our@@ ing volunteers .
it is centrally that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it takes , and they might make the time meaning@@ ful bridges , for example with language courses .
whoever can help you feel the feeling , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , would not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate .
the distinct majority is motiv@@ ated .
problems are also true , says customer hon@@ est@@ ly , &quot; People who doesn &apos;t go nothing . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mamm@@ ut@@ most &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are the two after the youngest inci@@ dents in front of radi@@ cal@@ ization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what lack of n@@ ai@@ v is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a residual risk could be , but will not exclu@@ de it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sen@@ si@@ bilities are the hel@@ per yet .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the attack would deliver it completely to call .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and hon@@ our@@ ful people must look at this place and in the region according to activities .
in the background , it is always in the background that soon a new Sto@@ ß had come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
do Germany need an upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer this question .
actually it is not fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived here , where we want to go , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the location .
Reg@@ ine client also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has already been le@@ ached to integrate the previous people sen@@ sible .
there are currently about 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them , both women are in@@ ig .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
