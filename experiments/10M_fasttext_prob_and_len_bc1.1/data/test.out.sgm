<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps economic policy in comparison: IT's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the commercial agreement TTP - that's both Clinton as well as trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential elections were, however, in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the in doubt rather small and warned against how the state of the economy does harm - with tax and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton to grinders the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will drive uplifting massively, and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for private people and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has certain duties to meet, he has disadvantageous opportunities to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would be increased, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which the must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost wortless.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate in announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state-French Teachy wings of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, the internal discussions could be added to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and drive the coal promotion in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is also possible to announce that in so far protected areas, the Parisian climate agreement will be announced.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to strengthen its investment program, Clinton aims to expand and demands: "a country will create the superstructure of clean energies and create million jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is probably either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - also at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the well-known trade agreement, they will not sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the USA don't want to isolate the international trade, but just use American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars was a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump does not want to do this question isn't quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must go, then he says he would not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is probably likely to develop the control policy of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side, trump, which wants to loads the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him before, that the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who want to ask at least of the rich they will pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who are alone, almost every everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany, they often are traumatic.</seg>

<seg id="30">Who believe that the end as soon as they come in Germany, tell Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here all women in refugee centres would often be considered as a minimally considered and worse.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to about 90 per cent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north, estimates them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are not voluntarily surrendered."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: a "Alliance of external lateral"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months of the war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin met his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in receiving, I can't forbid it, that Ankara wants to admit this reconciliation in most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a blow, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putting the smile was narrowed and he felt hardly heat, even for his recollection conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said," "" "love" "" "Putin - according to a report of all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day a newspaper wrote that Erdogan would have been so fucked, than would never be worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to signify the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that the state of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the snapshot of a Russian fighter aircraft by Turkey by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow proceeded out of reaction at the time.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared from and accused Ankara to be back in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was even bigger, because it was already committed by a memorable friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetraury will build up again when it's impossible to become impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the months, the state controlled media introduced a sharp, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">It seemed at once, when the Turks would bear the iniquity.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the serious, the allegations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He disputed this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting occurred only because Putin was given to excuse the excuse of the President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of an armistion is clear at hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily for all friends that he can get, after he became the last month at a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again, terror attacks on Turkey were also shaken.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions met Turkey hard - especially the ban of batches, each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is dropped by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisles of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, state-television endorsed fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural are imported again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is looking back to the West, since it was a weak response to the attempted power of power.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the persisting grounding of the EU accession negotiations and Putin will come on it from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian state Secretary of State took a bonus to ensure that he called for the elected coup of government in Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is well-noted for Moscow, a self-intelligibility for Moscow, which itself has a deeper fear of regimechange.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace by the sea made it possible in Russia and Turkey, an how it once described me a analyst, "Alliance of external lateral ones": two countries that are cast off from the West and feel poor.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two still big differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow had recently restored the role as a peace party, but to support Russia and Turkey by mutual agreement.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be drawing that after nearly three hours of first talks, both President on the press conference said that they had not taken the topic once.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey formied it intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise these.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominner can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potentials for a perfect disaster, when the NATO member Turkey crossed the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin it reads that Putin without specifying "the dismissal Ivanovs ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidiary administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was chairman of Ivanovs since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972, in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he made his degree in Tokyo at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later was the protocol and Chief of Staff of the government's government.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important role of the government to assist your activity as a state of state in compliance with bills and checks to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This stage has made the mysterious mystery of Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time of the narrowest confidentials Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on TV, both men said that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the slowing for the cameras, here only few of them are convinced - mainly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this so the result of a kind of power against?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was previously commended as a potential President, to once the Russian environmental policy would like to lead to great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his comments on Putin, who are cited on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said "It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation with me this very complex - one could say almost any post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it was out, I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidiaries for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), he was appointed KGB, Ivanov was appointed chairman of his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin met his power, he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he trusted in the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once again, Ivanov was supposed to have been President of Russia to the second term of President of Russia, as a third term of Putin could cast off against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken by another, near ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before he returned to President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economics Keith Brown took a visit to the site today and was one of the first that went down from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment during the construction of Queensland Crossing.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an aesthetic design of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were alone used for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the sealing is between the viaduct and the bridge-deck, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of almost 79% of the total bridge decks at their place and last section of the Decks will get a betongle for the deck, which means that the entire Deck will be ready to reach the bridge at its square.</seg>

<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very heatle activity.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green mine: investors are expected to be stronger stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "Handheld concept" in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But battle is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The first line is about the question: who should actually build the favourable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The SPD faction leader Christoph Bratmann said: "we are happy to build us with the green areas: who wants to build public areas in the future, must account for 20 percent of all apartments as a social apartments."</seg>
<seg id="9">The affordable apartments can also be opened in stock.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent, but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as a social apartments." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing programme, which will cost millions of cost and is still funded, is intended for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, such as Frmann: "there is currently no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The lens wants to increase hardness levels for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of what, violmann, bted a disappearance of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept concept has been implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet the program is no longer available: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments whose funding is going to run in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planner spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought-out ties from the city.</seg>

<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments there could be back in the price for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: we do not want the owners, the housing companies do not want.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social apartments in the West city is increased again and is removed from the goal of the so-called blending.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating, how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">For teenager and child for playing no longer go without, but it rather prefer to spend their leisure time, on screens to rigid, was accused of many complained in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go it comes to get people from the sofa and become active more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and lastly on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hence it is great to see that technology and activities are not unlocking in the outdoors.</seg>
<seg id="7">I joined the Pokémon Go-Wahn, a app that is based on the characters initially, which were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later it emerged from an animation series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of populations sank the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed through the massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within few days Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smartphone to outside and looking for Pokémons which were followed with a GPS when they were found once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "can be captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game, when she was still younger, joined the valve and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps which puts the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiac, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, shared the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed, that jumped every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - only the raw data for the performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring "themselves for 30 minutes," from the sofa to come "and" every day, "shooting down their ears, because many public messages are bored, and they come from people who look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the meaning of sport cannot be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances to cure cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages, which is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that people can do something in the open, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mürk-destroys, which must always be complain about anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if your smartphone apps could follow our activity as Fitbit earlier, they gave us no reason to play sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new one will lose its friction and the use will be repeated with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons, there will be more games, apps and virtual reality with the activist will be combined in the real world and will help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I am under the women's olympig in the Tower and that is from more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, since 1984, I've been in every summer olympiade and the US were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three turnerves, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, inspired by many young girls of other skin colour inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the catholic, is round, makes it proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">There has been the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this kind of sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one was under the female gymnasium in an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the last Olympic Games he was a surprising Olympic champion in Gabby Douglas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but masterful Gymasticulture routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual men, who won gold for women with an individual multi-event event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but so you don't see turnout classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympics can only have four turers in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality shows that Turns is an expensive sport and is Turner at first line in private sorting, which will arise for training, income, travel, travel, clothing and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families), and the list can be obtained as arbitrary.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner first received their whole training and this is a most expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer by Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started with the tower since then.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to meet the municipalities of Aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an efficient and light accessible turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turnaround for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">With my events we have ordered a free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15.000 young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winner.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we are expanding into Detroit (my hometown) to offer high quality sound quality to learn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and destination for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life benefits for health and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the Turns and this is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic Team Gold and thank you, Fass you motivated so many young girls with a variety of background motivated to get healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="3">We talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Versions in New York to find out how to move with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you sever yourself from the front or from the back you will show how you turn the spear for your robbers.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you hit you from behind, then you should turn out as a result, so that you can see your attackers, and "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon then between your forearm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him with the knees into the strip and turn, while the attackers shot off pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move on backwards, while the weapon will move on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">When attackers, who are approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the line, take the weapon, and turn it, so the attackers can not shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Put the weight on the weapon and beat the attackers on the chest, then turn the weapon from his handle before they move on backwards and destroy the weapon upon him.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British Reiser subdued his immune system and sausages of a serious examination by taking some of the most tasteful and most of the most polluted places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and itautor Ian Wright, 51, out of Suffolk disclosed down its course on a euro coin, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaving each object he used a Luminometer for himself and to show us what he is going to let.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was labelled under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," some surprising results were in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the rinsing knob of a pulling toilet, which was already used by thousands of other uses, may be completely disable but actually, in a kitchen spawns more poor bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke of doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he took away, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of its gut by becoming the world as well as such as wonderful things as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to railway stations up to rinsombs of toilets, the task set its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child I was relatively inworried about what my health concerns and I put all possible things in my mouth, Earth, worms and sludge."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he became a reputation for his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His prosthetic line showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometric hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to feed her Luminometry over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have a less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of various places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes to the worst thing which I smoked in a toilet, close." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not angled here because it is incarcerely here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Cross" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company uses Mr Wright with Valid Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validation Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that fascinates the fascinating and the advantages of probiotics is explained at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed mad Brainstormings, which ended so we said "Let us call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is to be a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of only talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we were able to provide the consumer for more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added: "let me lose my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him, like the ecelful Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there was things that it was easier to bring Ian to bring them up and others, where this was rather difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty spawies. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by validation carried out from 2015, 84 per cent of respondents said in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent stated that they contain at least occasionally products that both added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, as this property is probably considered as a beautiful part of the Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is infamous and her reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pair had three sons, the meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police told us that the terror, which had added the family, crushing of residents, drug abuse, drugs, and excessive reading, streches and curse included.</seg>

<seg id="28">That was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be terrible for her neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I guess all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the church, have gone to us and have made the information we have made.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsky Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives get nothing of summer campaign against - and the holiday from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the Parliament election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the German Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is not so far as to date: summer holidays, heat and landing battle - that's the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are to be impressed by the fishers are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holiday, which are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not a native, so may not choose the landday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Practical problems include practical problems: in the holidays are helper, the posters hang up, air balloons, flyer and discounted in the end of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and final school day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass once a election campaign just under the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot stage, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998, is the strongest party, clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, how strongly Neuling AfD cuts and remains at the end of the end thereof.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age and heads of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees his grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, spread Rosen and plaught a little with people, as it did already become his legendary, former predecessor, Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise he has got cold feet to get cold feet and gave German Chancellor Merkel the blossoms of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy," "" "We are creating this" "" "the rise of spopoists will accelerate what it is thought to cost him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its peak current data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how to make the right place for the right place in the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited twice in German Chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel's headquarters is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "probably the majority of other federal states," "" "accused Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But there too bad anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel will listen.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the North East-CDU sell largely on the usual elections on market spaces and shopping malls with umbrellas and air balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, as cocaine, plays only a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noticed that you rooted on the country the base, that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are as the left hand, the SPD, the Greens: in the times of the country scarcely there.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU-fighting Kokert to his Mitstreite is also selflarvingly: "they must go where it is weary where people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Social Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD had still gained 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, do you want to create the jump into the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make out of the holiday-need a modern tugend and put down their election campaign to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Supervisory Board Claudia Müller is called "online campaign" for election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, follow-up of the Green Elepher on track search for domestic stimulars under the vacations.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the Spitzenkandidatin, curvt just with a house boat through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it still nice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination: who is buying sound records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you submit to the commentaries to overpass it under the pseudonym non-samlegensamic defect-ages with smokers, this statement is derived from the current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most recent reformation of Schallplatten is not back on a boom in millennials which we want to welcome the repowerment of physical objects, but on Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely Käuble group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbyists - it has a emotional meaning: older record buyers keep your feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report in television, I would follow me the camera, while I live in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray ophoist and wild sculiers, before I understand my hands and tell a little effort as: "so, let us throw away a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slow to its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the building where once independent sellers have been resident - there is a handful of fantastic record business.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera system to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I by Sister Ray (data): two young women, three men mean age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight males mean age, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and proceeds through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, ask me?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess" I guess, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4.000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sound records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by him), clothe walls of its living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy sheets, that he could not afford to buy objects when he appeared and again to buy objects when he was young and plea.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late '60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought to buy something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he is true that those who want to buy the records are more tolerated and gladly spend this time, and adds:" "" "I don't smoke and I drink not much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets the YouGov-profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and have caused itself to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations that I have led, people usually have been emptied to their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that were once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of adding a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to detect that plate stores a soothing community of equisals.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez some of the older clients participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of confided sound plate, from objects, happy to watch the happy hour of youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or ownership of the property owner as a kind of comfort," "" "says White." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collectors so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" soldered a employees from a plate stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM published in April, that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate, have no record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I blended through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, the sounds of the Universe (number of people: three men of middle age) works, has a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone booked only recently here and said," I have no record players, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate, so that I can set them into the shelf. "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive loads, less musictures.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who only enter slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound records almost a whole floor, has an underground audience when I purify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are pairs about 70, tourists who take photos, teenager and women of medium-ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of the latest Synthesis and sextet pop instead of experimental jazz drens from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such densities at the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange from them, but nagious psychic traumata are hard-able if one stands for about 30 seconds next to someone.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been around for some minutes in the store and considered the Varietics of the plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shovenclosures than a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">They deserves no much, therefore the Collecting of sheets does not say real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from one computer or in other way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a delightful sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of record players have to be inspired: urban Outjam.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket that jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenants who grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left you will find a staircase full of plates, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics that essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees her - maybe because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to deal.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "Record Art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction is doing more money for the industry, and for some customers could send out some customers into the depths of Soos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research results showed that the results of YouGov will vote, at least in sheet stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record players that exist in reality, record stores and in Onlineforums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the stroll through the stroll of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while the starring view of an unsecret, 30-year-old Moderator, who rises nothing at the shoulders of the middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French dish is rejected by the authorities of Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in the thousands of refugees living in Calais.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a trial negotiated this week, the authorities in Calais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional businesses within the camp, including cigarettes to Energylic, sell hairdressing services or tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or easy meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would be paid in parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid, and the risk of fire and sanitation of fire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups distributed to the court that businesses and restaurants are important because the free meals that supported by the state-supported Association and other groups are offered, not enough food for growing numbers in the camps.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops, but also revealed that the concerns of Calais Prefecture are absolved. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that the food shops, cafes and restaurants would be playing a lot more important role, than just people live in extreme preconditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of calm meet points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the remorsel was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is currently operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a advice on asylum procedures for the hundreds of needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-7 Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday night at a abrupt hold on the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in the handling, side-stepping, back up, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympics in every color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was defeated by the non-bad consolation prize - Great Britain - Great Britain on that day - and they could easily be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, Fiji would have put a 15-man team in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not be - that at least a brilliite will have hanging a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost any game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap is wearied, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to recover and left the attacks of GBS.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co., when you run to running buses. the World Series winners went from 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau arrived in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner of which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">Scarlet 12-0 and GB hardly hit the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A strong tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to get a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the Resanpfiff and there was still over one minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou's deleted by another weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji, when Fiji was born to play the 7 while the GB still wanted to run.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to the half-time, and closed the fijianic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua passed Tuisova after a Brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long enough in favour of the South American, whose fans sang and danced at the Tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the game approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame replaced the i-bag with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff-önte, the Fijis impoverished and the GB are smashed down in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the days Fiji Japan defeated in the semi-finals with 20-5, and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a close half-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half of the front, but Dan Norton pierced the line with an impressive foot and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliantly late Tackling from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside teams, secured the win - and thereby the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the cancer of the Trainers</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotional gold than with these games and that will be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing until the last, 220 tough Hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning took an additional significance in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only those who were sitting at the ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was also present at the second Olympiad in succession, the first women in the history of British Sports which had a scale of such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your Dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.ter unproposed use, which is also an exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes that glides over the surface with elegance of sponges, which does not reflect the kind of Triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each Gold in the rowing there is a battalion that contribute to the incremental progress that account the difference and it was no one of the trainer that would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, the operable and what did they do.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do it, he spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather serious situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could be early in early 2014, out of season, could begin with the interruptions to a minimum if this is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore I had to go better again.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was a incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the unmediability of victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who spent a home in the morning with a little more than anything, and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was the centurion at the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said "I was a emotional wreck. this is maybe something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeats only how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">We were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would have no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for trainers or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race during the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the past 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to leave not away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not able to make something of rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to have no fireworks, we wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear on a wedding next week, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now you just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I would not say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing has already accompanied her whole life: as young girls she has accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in an seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing to me - emotional and physically," describes it.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels a balanced, merry and a total of alive, says it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Very next to her health and mind doing something good.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, who says Erhard Hackler von der German senior liga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music, Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular merger you can connect the social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also taken Ursel KTip in their choir:" "" "to discuss and organize himself on the others and to learn of one another - a choir is a very special form of merging." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Sing can sing in the positive sense, Hackler wants to sing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because his seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever calls his lungs are regularly requested, but in everyday life is not so fast out of the purest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it goes to get the sound of the voice in the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, Ursula Lenz is part of the Federal labour community of senior citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the joint Singen had a lot higher place, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure time, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz is often observed that the singing or listening of songs with older people are weaving many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, dementia people in long returned events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the head requires a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focus on their own voice and to adapt to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone, do not only focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one goes through the singing in the choir, Hackler writes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows by the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even I will show yourself: if I do something for something, I will better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with the singing, so there are enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he wants to have little talent, Lenz Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not sing alone - at 50 singing people who listens to, if a sound comes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer, seniors have several possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If anyone sing out of the circle in a senior enchyor, you can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">He who wants to sing in a church choir may take directly to the church or church officers.</seg>
<seg id="33">A lot of seniors can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Who doesn't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask help with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Whoever desires to sing, should definitely be connected to a choir, at Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">The soul will sing well and has something good. it is true for each age.</seg>

<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which the two will receive six teams from the first and second place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed case will leave the strong Dutch in a little longer from the way that lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out, the Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story, four years after it landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a Hockeycomb in hands (her two older sisters played the Sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national playing in the United States, the most recent in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and inexhaustably, a fast relay switching between competition and streams.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, when the Olympic Fackel itself would be a burning rod that will protect the wrists for the triathletes for the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn to the tv, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the quake, without Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the battle between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a Black Sea with dimples, would definitely be sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being-being TV advertising when he would have a swimmers, Turner or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame doesn't illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade there are sports types that are not generally accepted: aerial guns, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming, and may have it a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make certain arguments for my certain lovers, then let me leave the attention to the discreet charm of trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had made his debut in Sydney, the last 16 years had been so annoyed that many of whom I had asked, did not know that there is an Olympic portability at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional Ignorms.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent an athlete for competition, it never won a medal in the trampolines and had an athlete until 2012, who made it until the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share the women for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolines jump a certain outside side charme, partly because it sounds for an unsolved ear for a clownsschule as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a little enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartons of his never too wanted rivering - but also the Grazie of the Turnens and Tauern, which unites two sports.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" originates from the Spanish El trampoline, which means that as much means "trampoline board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victor jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost to 30 feet into the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, real and salt) before going on at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to official Olympiaprogram, you will be rated as soon as version, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallions must go on in their streches after gold, faster, upward and dron, sometimes even to the finish, sometimes move and back, down and downwards at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are not only chase the line line or the starting wall, but in the TV transmission, also another highlight: the world's or the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-targeted Streets is Nobel, admired, even fanatic, and it's enough to stir even a viewer.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's too, what I can look at this games like something.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of these, the trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prunned, seemingly heavy duty like an astronaut, then moved to the top, then moved back up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves into the distance, only the dreaming, elegant repealing of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen like the competition for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and endowns of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will illuminate the duck as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who will probably see in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by the attacking and the objection of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently, Dooley is expecting to reincaring his new fanclub.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the protesters were killed during clashes with the police in Schussaud.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to break?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable states of Africa, a solid of Western Europe with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, the protests against the government had the country and far exceeded themselves in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week there were thousands of people on the streets and the fundamental fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was inmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave that policemen were shot and killed unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, the video above the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, will show how security professionals hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The UN CEO of Human Rights demands a detailed analysis now.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to stop this land and will even be more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated to be the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services collaborate closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror beyond the region, in particular in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopians business expanded in a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new Pendlersuit in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even when Ethiopia was anything as an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continued the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, and dissidents were effective in silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were put into exile or put into prison, put them into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth were Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints which cover everything from the ground up to the spouse with regard to power of the government's government.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition, and control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time stresses along the border to Eritrea; a fight for these zacky, controversial line called in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less explicitly in recent years, could protect the turbulence and themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the provocation after years of age shall be explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with social media, as cheaper smartphones have been more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government turns access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, can communicate many people still over Internet Proxies, which hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian argued that they gathered themselves to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest Ethnic in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not a natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Equal prospered the Amharas, which originate from Ethiopia in East Germany, in politics and economy, during which the Oromos exploited, of which many Muslims are living and live in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are involved with a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population, and who are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in the trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenadawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on an unsealed disease in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia, Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was viewed as a tactical genius, a man that could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that it was particularly standardized in this, early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special privileges to edit your opponents and make them irharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing in this fundamgenius" "", "said Mr Abdi, a conflict." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Cailemariam Desalegn, Cailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Tyrol, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fears that the result will be more blood shed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections, according to the information published by the government, apparently, and then stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">While the following Razzians were killed, many protestants were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and that time the unrest went relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendlersuit, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this is not the intensification of internal misery of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And they take a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesting in Gondar, an amharic city, by Tigray, and the hatred towards the tigray in the social media is still practised in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst predict that the protests in the USA and other Western allies are present in a separate position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights about the neighboring Somalia, even if they had recently signed that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West is clear to support democracy, he does not want to merge his ban in a already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement by Obama in ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday that his campaign revoked his campaign, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification designed new questions concerning the communication skills of the Republics of the Republicans to communicate whether it is capable of communicating and understandable with the American public.</seg>

<seg id="14">At the end of July, he moved with strong criticism, when he thought that Russians would love Mrs. Clint emails, but later he said "Of course, I thought the sarethical."</seg>

<seg id="18">Instead of the tone for the Presidential elections, Mr. Trump adopted an even corrosive tone, since its response has declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, who was published on Friday, showed a lead with a great lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-on-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is trying to do not have to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort or understand his declarations.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is strengthened in focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze his loyal Mitstreite into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be made.</seg>

<seg id="21">They were the Americans who sent food to hungry during the first world of World War. "a Square Meal" distinguishes the roads with which the country was surrounded, no longer to be the slaughter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time in the food for the Americans, a central, donated Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new Budgetary diet was the new Budgetary: mysteriously food such as breads and chasserules were used for basic food, the casserole dish recovered, "noted Ziegelman, as Köche unappetite ingredients could hide under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dryobst.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, the heart of the American kitchen was, became a rare luxury.</seg>

<seg id="27">During their research on the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"there was no more popular accommodation at noon," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions do not fit each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclist is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">More rare view.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland is usually only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation on board the research ship Sanna was allowed to return to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swimmers with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie has only been getting married for 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland's ground is the ground of the North Atlantic coast, an average of 1.220 meters in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes down, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a massive 2.6 km / h - and it is very fast as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This of long loneliness lifestyle seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues are reported in the journal Science "in any case from a Greenland, the 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demgraphic research in Rostock this lifespan, which means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist thought that Greenland is a long time of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lack the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's hair is difficult to observe, finally, they live mainly in the ice-sea before the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually occur at the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know about the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their period of time empt it, when they spread six animals with a transmitter in front of the Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Spoil: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a seal, another one had swallowed the pine bones of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for Kadaver, those from higher water layers down to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 at Greenland or Svalbard as a catch-off from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long while the largest 502 centimetres measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the liner core of sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises from the birth of Haie, which the proteins contained in the proteins later will not be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear captions try greater amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the smallest size of 220 centimeters, the liner core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 of the nuclear weapon, it is likely to be celebrated its 50th birthday at its test in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens core, normal carbon-14 amounts to normal carbon-14 amounts, which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 o'clock showed a 493-centimeter-long Greenland an old age of 335 years, while the b-shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only got to get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably determined on the threshold for sexually mature and his age at 156 years of age, Grönlandhaie leaves the majority of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland, whose bacon on the neck is a 120-year-old harpopointed tip, was captured in Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures often the organism of the living animals often runs out there.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they turn later - and alarms slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm water in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives in more dangerous and should focus on it as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible," "" "says the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should be investing in a long life in contrast to its resources.</seg>

<seg id="9">The two-fler had injustice in 2012 and they will be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answered every question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 bn on witty growth, creating a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport as well as in whole GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have been a great team in Heathrow, which was a £11 bn worth of infrastructure investment program in time and budget, chosen by T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport office until T2, which was built in the middle of the two frequency inverters.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third running time, which is supported by £16 billion on private investments.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus in the use of tools and algorithms that resemble them of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, water-less surface and CO2 tight atmosphere was once recorded as a similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be declared by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin but erdsimilar atmosphere could still rise slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably proved more dry areas than the earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protecting rapidly evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS-model simulation the slow rotation of Venus its daily side of the sun was almost two months long," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which seems like a rainbow, to remove the surface of the bulk of sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are some degree cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of Venus that resembles Evolution, which previously assumed by Planeteners.</seg>

<seg id="2">The newest mission with Kepler's Kepler telescope has helped to collect the most complete catalogue on rotational rates among the stars of the star of the Plejades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers understand why stars in star cluster is rotating at different rates as well as in which connection the rotational areas of the formation of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="4">We hope through the same of our results with other star cluster, more about the relationship between the mass of a death, his age and even the history of his solar system, "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a Short news release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 lightyears away from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach the adult.</seg>
<seg id="7">You are now turning on the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">To peak rotational rates, these gripping stars lists large quantities of stars.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star switch off, its rotational rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotational rate of every star by taking the time between the publication of a recognizable starcks -- such as sunlight.</seg>

<seg id="14">In the "Ballet" of the Plejades we see that slow rotors have to be massive to be massive, while in against faster rotors that tends to be very bright stars, "said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideological laboratory to compare substitute qualities such as rotary rates.</seg>

<seg id="15">In order to receive the final turnkey code, the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of Cryptownite Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users use the personal photo database on the game, it is possible by companies for sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off when a Ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses by Ransomware, 13 percent had to break down the business operations in case of a case of people in life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of acute acute disease.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we will always say," "" "Do not pay, you only promote the problem" "", "says Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, will get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to undergo the demand of the perpetrators in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security forscher of F-Secure examines the commercial areas and the contact with the pressions and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims by chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support sites, or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to pay partly hard negotiating and pay five-digit sums to return their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and relatively risricular winnings from Ransomware-pressings, the hacker will always be professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski by the Internet provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software modular, to the actual compressors.</seg>
<seg id="30">The present malware kits created by the malware himself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery is an adaptool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pressings are looking for further hacker to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you logged in one of the forums in the substrate, buying the set of a crime and commissioned another way to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infiable calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals act with dissemination," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of companies in the Malwarebody survey trust in the Malwarebody survey by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful completion, the perpetrators" "" "instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing" "", "explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, damage potential for the type of data is still more times higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could also take up completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hackerconference Defcon, security forscher demonstrated how they could get a thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the split of a dertype block heating could be quite a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday-free</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda offers everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty unloaded, but the HR-V that has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz was actually proved to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1,60 m high HR-V was rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the fond, it does not work closely.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior space are well-processed and are comfortable, only the cockpit upper side falls there.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a trunk of 453 l at highly positioned and 1026 l when folded back-folded back reject, but there are the "Magic Seats".</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical, than it sounds: the seat surface of the back seat can be folded as Kinosessel, and therefore offer storage space, which is up to ceilings 1.24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space can be loaded well, however, the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to set out his work for a bit more quiet.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is very pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another engine is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">All-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the gift is expected to be direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the tested top variant "Executive" there is no desires to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">To the safety systems the city-emergency braking system (works up to speed 32), the collision system and trace assistent.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collisions irreates sometimes, because he has been rated at the rank of many obstacles as" "" "heralizing objects." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote assistant works very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign detection and threatened the speed as required.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, the full connectivity makes it only for the top-features: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, App-Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and a HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you do not want to invest in such a lot, gasoline engines will receive from 20,000 Euro, diesel engines from 23,000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="27">The motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and allstandable car.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening one matured for ever, at night it is time for hours of wake, in the morning there is no more difficult to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's all others as relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is often with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adults sleep sleeping disorders and more than ten per cent do their sleep frequently or permanently as non-relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there may be varied causes of causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society of Sleeping Beauty and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you undergo down, but is the Insomnie, so it is an entry and a sleeping interrupt.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just those who sleep through many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German house medical association with practice in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbed?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also medicines medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not seldom is the sleeping expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking up especially with depression is often" "", "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors may be rooted on each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and starts to greet, about everyday problems and ensure greet, gives Weeß an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should one do with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who doesn't sleep well over a month of at least three nights per week and is impaired on the day, should consult doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, unleashed, has difficulties with the attention and the concentration, is easily irritable, has voting fluctuations or physical complaints like magor or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to linking the sleep, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, in particular behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleep fats only in the exceptional case and at most for two weeks - inquery.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, he has hardly been emphasised in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why one should not apply with sleeping difficulties at first to the housedoctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who was to sleep in sleep, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For an investigation in the sleep laboratory, for example, in case with breathing difficulties, for example with breathing difficulties, if you do not find the cause of a sleep interrupt, Fiche has been declared.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to test the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">It should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not make a lunatic nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After dismantling you go into bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one of the nasal brille is wearing a chest strap and a bonder on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera also distinguishes the sleeping corner on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those problems get in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many positions on which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular bed- and standing times, not too long in bed, on the day do not sleep, not watching television to sleep, alcohol depart, and at night not on the watch - then it starts to count immediately, and that's quite and not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it is already built: by 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy district," as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain is called, but are illustrated in the last weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, the residents of rent lease, on the ground floor, however, rooms have been occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the "no-Go zone" for policemen and the 94 "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence since the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the premises on the ground floor, the cadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared, patched the police three weeks in official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locking parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, in the order of the unknown builder, the premises of the unknown house owners had the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers went under the Jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents go with children, people sit on the brush in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about the late Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin we have primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the "Kiez" since 1999, and Jana * who draws three children above all from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin projects, they share the care before increasing rentals and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound right after a Kiez, who wish to wander mostly from vandalizing Left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin Interior, and the police between house occupied and her neighbours, obviously doesn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional labor quarter, which also has a lower average in comparison to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">The residence and the native residential projects belong to the "Kiez": in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR, including almost the entire mainstream street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainstream had been evacuated in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the quarter has become increasingly become the magnets for tourists and electoral liner from around the world, with them now share living from GDR's times and former house occupied its Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rentals since 2009, which has increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as a symbols for these development: they detects them in checked discs or freshly knitted facades, which were subjected to paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street often mentioned this year along with the words "linksandome Violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason why not all neighbors who have seen it as a problem, could be that they are not impacted by the crime of crime, according to statistics, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the criminal offences make in damages, the tensionally rather to meet the newbuilds and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, uncertainty can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What is violent, they are weightorious: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who would not have been this.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars will give it straight to the Rigaer for longer than no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For who studied Architect, her street is not a criminal record, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of one another, as elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has moved and remained in the Rigaer Straße.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was so important that the residents got their streets: from the police, the politics and the media that were suddenly taken place in July all the deciphorus of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of the inhabitants of Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by scanned new buildings in former buildings that remains the old inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="36">As there are frustration on all sides, even by the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For Zugezogens, who would like more than paint bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyone who draws, should be aware of it - just like any man, who draws up in a swept area, poorly complain about noise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee lecturer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisational measures.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also she is social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee lecturer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the management of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It can be regarded as the contact partner for all actors: refugees, workers, refugee aid, administration, authorities, and who else could still be mixed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer indicates that the volunteer has been thankful more than thankful that Deuschle is now, the woolen woolau, which has mainly a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less spottest than rather to the multitude of wish we wish to ask for a multitude, as the administration wanted to write the position.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sought a administration of administration with a talent for languages and people, associated with a longstanding experience in the field of social work, just a jealizing woolau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration of administration is not its central area, Annika Deuschle believes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially go to organisation, work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with this since approximately six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent limited place on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine client that Annika Deuschle honors and the main actors supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are great and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A heavy problem exists since some time, apartments for the connection of the connection of the connection that have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to place refugees in their own or rented residential rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, the rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear communes themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Parliament and the job and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search have been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto find the administration of no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it did not work to have been addressed to private apartments, Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, we must be able to be contracted, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon there will be new containers in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a solid lead, it is an internships, training places, training places, A-euro jobs and aid workers for refugees and migrants who need to be spotted or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help home-mastery, do-profit-profit work - and motivated as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive outer effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">He is not only working.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day require a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop an intimely experience.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sport, contacts with locals and mainly language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So jump here administration and honouring volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees that it takes, and they might make the time meaningful bridges, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever can help you feel the feeling, he could not work in Urbach, would not work and be unprofitable, who will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problems are also true, says customer honestly, "People who doesn't go nothing." the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "that was an" "" "Mammutmost" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are the two after the youngest incidents in front of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "no," "" "says Regine client quite clearly," "" "what lack of naiv is" "". "a residual risk could be, but will not exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensibilities are the helper yet.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attack would deliver it completely to call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do nothing," "" "says Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honourful people must look at this place and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, it is always in the background that soon a new Stoß had come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Do Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is not fair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived here, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the location.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes clear that the Urbacher has already been leached to integrate the previous people sensible.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women are inig.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
