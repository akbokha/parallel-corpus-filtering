Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak concerning the implementation of international agreement as well as in Teh@@ n@@ ans for@@ wards measures in the Middle East .
however , at the meeting it is also said to have the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ States solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been e@@ ased for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing sett@@ ling of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu on man@@ any@@ ways at the peace process .
by the Obama of Obama , in order to wor@@ sen@@ ate the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two approaches has deterior@@ ated .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu declared on invitation of the Republi@@ can in front of the US Congress a controversi@@ al speech delivered to Obama as an aff@@ inity to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected the election in Israel with regard to his address given in Israel .
in a emergency call he said to have shot his gir@@ l@@ friend
in a not@@ ep@@ ad , Professor Sh@@ annon clearly told us with a special voice of the police that he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and would have to come to the civil servants in his home .
in fact , it was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably more excited , and he said , the contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile .
within the house the officials announced the che of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note that was on a white souvenir sheet : &quot; I felt so tired , I loved it , and she &apos;s the only woman that loved me . &quot; this was according to the information of the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no evidence that in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , set up as early as 300 miles to the school premises where he shot at the door of a popular histor@@ ies professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University of Poli@@ cies Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University staff had heard the Sh@@ oot at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that I made the fat@@ eful emergency call out of it .
by the end of the day , there was another death : the Lamb took life , when the police wre@@ cked him .
one day after the shooting of shooting in the university , students and do@@ z@@ ers forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , authorities still try to create a picture of it , which motiv@@ ated themselves .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at the two ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they had rejoiced in his instruction .
the police in bo@@ aters , where Pr@@ ent@@ bite died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself had mentioned in a written book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; mira@@ cul@@ ous men &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both sub@@ contra@@ cted in the Department of Social Sciences and History , comprising 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ ing , the Lamb praised , said that he also felt a bit excited and nerv@@ ous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
prior to that the Delta State University asked for a reference of health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
he conducted only two Online courses this year .
the latest changes in employment policy of the University is important that the doctorate has worked so hard for the Lamb that had no guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he caught nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was a little bit of Mr Lam@@ inate idea . &quot;
that is questions I can no answer :
after the flight from the Campus , the police found later Lam@@ bs trail , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he could be arrested , in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran even in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house but Johnson said that he believed that he knew people who lived there .
accommodation grew in the area .
in 2009 , he began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants , and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in Spring in Ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends formed him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said it was 15 and he was 20 , when they met together with shared friends .
they and their friends were in the High School , and he was the cool old guy who tried some years to bring the guitar race .
he was then the Black Sea .
every woman melted away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson city of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ ails were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call said I got my wife , &quot; but there was no decree from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in the bo@@ aters .
the police told that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ am said they were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ am said he has never met that but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and blues .
Lamb arrived off when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail showed both on a summer @-@ vintage three years ago .
later they played together the one or another .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ am said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ bite was a nurse that had been online for several companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entert@@ ordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak illuminated bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had the Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night in the night of September 5 , after that his guitar and mouth @-@ harmon@@ ic finished over an audience .
there was no evidence that anything did not agree .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were with you and spl@@ ash with each other .
I mean it had both a good sense for kid@@ ding .
Schmidt , the dead professor , managed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native people and colonial history , said Father Allan Mitchell , a English teacher at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , on Tuesday evening about 900 people took part in Cleveland , including Do@@ z@@ ers , employees , students and members of the commune in a candle light .
Sch@@ mid@@ y &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated in the memorial day , whilst the University of University sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amaz@@ ing Grace . &quot;
classes will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press authors Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to contra@@ di@@ ct the police , that the police made the emergency after he had shot when he had shot , and that lamb prepared in his emergency call , but there is no evidence that the two would have married .

it was remarkable also for personal reasons .

UN boss says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an Ki @-@ moon says , his response to Russia enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will only be wor@@ sen@@ ed for millions of people .
the UN leader calls for once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , join to un@@ ite and integ@@ rative negotiations on the fin@@ alist of a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign minister of five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the si@@ del@@ ines of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .

B@@ an called for the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in Syria , that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 change values , show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some waiting for a breakdown .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans tried to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper gears to the ones below , it did not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin serious about real@@ izing what it means for the odds for nom@@ ination of real estate business .
of course it is too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump can probably gain the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that during this time the year 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was put on at the rising of Herman Cain , there was none of whom won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he strug@@ gling to fight in a general election .
but out@@ lay groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recogn@@ ise Tr@@ um@@ ps through stamina and start to flow up their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values to indicate that the property mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary stage :
rub@@ ber@@ ps are popular and can be rotated by 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced its candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the property @-@ Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
some three of ten say that they have negative opinion .
and these numbers keep in early countries .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ vote in I@@ owa raised last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P turn@@ out GO@@ P would be happy with ump as a candidate .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ can were won , they would be either excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of the 10 say that they would be &quot; anno@@ ying &quot; if he is the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages to say about the same enthusiasm such as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same more ag@@ ump ) .
the next to be enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; disp@@ leased , &quot; or &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Fav@@ our@@ ite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump wei@@ ly critic@@ ised for his shell and def@@ ending statements , 52 percent of those of the Republi@@ can Irish voters think that the real property mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first part of the nation state , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he said the personality of a commander in the Supreme Commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent said that he did not have the personality to perform his ministry and almost six out of 10 un@@ dependent say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House p@@ asse , ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the idea .
if they aband@@ on their winning stre@@ ak , republi@@ can elec@@ torate considers the real .
if they are asked to get those who wins the GO@@ P Nom@@ ination , they say four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four of July did not have any money to J@@ eb Bush .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters in the past do not have the clear crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans found that Rick Perry would gain the nomin@@ ee compared to only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , there is a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ can gathered around another candidates , Tr@@ ump strikes almost every one .
some experts show that the disin@@ teg@@ rated field will probably work to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is spread to more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head race between rub@@ b@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump into multi @-@ majority support .
he pointed out to Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ i and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who proposes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a vast majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have made their mind .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that just a little more than half of voters who support the ump , say that they will be st@@ oned off their voices .
of course there can be much , in order to change that , and no one can say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the most powerful competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ sur@@ g Ben Car@@ son , but voters who have formed their opinion , are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of the 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with ump in the theme of immig@@ ration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign had been interpreted &quot; rape &quot; in his election campaign in front of two months ago , immig@@ ration and fishing point was in public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are concerned that the Bom@@ bi@@ otic im@@ pres@@ cription of Tr@@ ump @-@ Americans are re@@ per@@ ed from the Republi@@ can party and the re@@ orientation efforts were damaged .
however , according to the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans agree that they coinci@@ de with ump with questions of immig@@ ration .
as long as the walk remains in the spotlight will be done by Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration above the government climb@@ s up to new high@@ s .
at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , almost half of the Republi@@ can voters are cancelled , mainly due to its outer stop status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey from ABC / post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are still angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa in two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans were fru@@ str@@ ated with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ho@@ ary . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive residential community - with view over the North Sea .
in the street a square meter area costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is limited to natural objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is stated in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which particular layers represents a square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bookings in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top motorhome , one of the price is similar .
the Real Estate service provider Angel &amp; Ful@@ kers has published an ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ ering prices in del@@ ight@@ ful high@@ lands .
there are several four@@ ths of thousands per square meters , each square meter , well noticed .
but good , who can aff@@ ord to aff@@ ord ...
by the way : Munich is as an exception here , not at the top .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream begins thanks to Mu@@ eller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ times sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a happy hour of Thomas Müller paved the way to FC Bayern the way to a thic@@ ken@@ er 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ans Pir@@ ro - then it ran .
a so@@ vereign opening of the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze made a dream start to the &apos; Mission Milan &apos; in the hex@@ ad@@ chair by Pir@@ ae@@ us .
the team of coach P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ ner twin pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ do@@ l hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth half @-@ success in series will be the first step towards the finish line on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to start the H@@ enk@@ el@@ ote to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller delivered to the Champions League at the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ guide to Bavaria @-@ go@@ al@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper who was going to pass a Flanders of the world champion at his time .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate it , &quot; had the Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 of hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept secret .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without sh@@ one .
Pi@@ raeus staged its youngest six home games in the Royal @-@ class , including prestigious clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also died .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , would not want to be the next victim .
they went very cour@@ age@@ ously , with their obvious effort but often to love his works .
the attacks were often led to the cra@@ w@@ ling outside of Douglas Costa , sel@@ dom ded against the Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i with the earlier brown @-@ acade@@ my Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
on the right hand Müller made more luck , when his flan@@ k hit the right flat in the left side of the door@@ way .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion made the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ as @-@ Stür@@ mer , Ide@@ a Brown defeated the Polish head of Poland from the line ( 26th ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knees par@@ d ( 3@@ 5. ) .
even though the Bayern moved into dominant game , Pir@@ ro could set up a needle @-@ pin .
at Tor@@ hil@@ ter Manuel New , however , was abandoned .
thus , when he put a kiss from ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te for@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
New Gu@@ ardi@@ ola has left a fourth round with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng - who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , post @-@ mus@@ cular problems returned in the pool , was initially sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cup hero won first light after his final training , says sports Chief Apostle Matthias Sam@@ mer said at &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought his King@@ sley Com@@ an for the distant Lev@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
god@@ liness came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear by El@@ f@@ m Mu@@ eller also a dr@@ on .
it was brought to the stadium in front of the stadium .
after a smaller group of sometimes mig@@ r@@ ushed Bavaria fans in their audience block the supporters of hosts Pi@@ raeus , with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with impact plugs of the Munich trailer .
at least one Bayern fan was deported to the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smo@@ kes are not only the lungs , but also the teeth - a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study close .
good news : for ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk drops quickly .
smo@@ kers have an increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this emerg@@ es from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ AM@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking they lay the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , in order to gain the 2.@@ 5- to 3.6 @-@ F@@ ache .
scientists have observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes for dent@@ ures are car@@ ies and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ AM@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the link between smoking and tooth dec@@ ants are therefore back to frequent gum disease in smo@@ kers .
not clear , however , smoking also increases the risk of car@@ ies .
people who list@@ ened to smoking by smoking could reduce their risk in a short period of time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ards come back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , first @-@ independent Thomas Dietrich von der English University Birmingham .
one must convince humans of this , non @-@ smoking , the study leader T@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened the lifetime . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and j@@ ars and leads to our guidance too good health to the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years are affected by po@@ int@@ less liquid .
previous tests would have been pointed out that smoking h@@ itting the risk for early rest@@ ra@@ ctions .
the new long @-@ term study lower the findings .

at all construction projects in the area of bor@@ ough@@ s Cologne , the museum has always been treated as a specialist support for archae@@ ology floor care .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards , the arch@@ e@@ ologists were moved with five .
from text documents , it was already known that in the place in the 4. century a fortress and in the 8th century a church was con@@ founded , backed by Trier .
beside the ruins of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with about 350 tom@@ bs , who belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute concerning TT@@ IP
the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ral system for the proposed trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP concerning the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP .
the controversi@@ al private medical devices for disp@@ utes between the corpor@@ ations and the states are intended to be replaced by a more transparent system , which corresponds to considerably more traditional courts in its operation .
&quot; we want to setup a system that trust the citizen , &quot; declared the Commissioner for Com@@ miss@@ ile Cec@@ ilia &apos;s adaptation during the performance .
the Swe@@ de also submitted proposals to enter the US negoti@@ ating position in the US for the European negoti@@ ating position with the United States .
the German Government announced support .
the world &apos;s largest free trade area in the world will be built with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration procedure may see specifically , that the EU states and the United States have jointly select an independent judge for a new investment in court .
they are to come to the same parts from the EU , the US and from third countries .
for the first time a second instance is en@@ vis@@ aged .
she would allow it to raise the or@@ acle .
until now , the rules of proce@@ eding associated with each arbit@@ rator , the claim against their det@@ erg@@ ents did not exist .
in the discussion of last months it became clear that citizens didn &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice wasn &apos;t commented .
long term , she wants to work according to an International Investment Court in the long term .
for example , disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries may also be clari@@ fied .
the role of major reasons for the major resistance of the investor ( IS@@ DS ) to be considered as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ rators are critic@@ ised by themselves as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ers , by companies of compensation of the tax@@ pay@@ ers , national law to cut both consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments , non @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act received proposals by the EU Commission as in@@ sufficient .
it is particularly critical that they should not apply to Canada ( CE@@ TA ) for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
by contrast , the German economic State Secretary Matthias Scho@@ en@@ nig ( SPD ) recorded their plans as major progress .
the Commission Con@@ sider the reform of essential points , the Minister for Economic Affairs and Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers in spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ rators be from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Sig@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business sector in Business@@ Europe previously warned that the benefits of the economy has to restri@@ ct the benefits of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be ad@@ ver@@ sely affected by this .
when the talks about the Free Trade Agreement TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) will continue to be dis@@ closed on Wednesday .

Del@@ ic@@ ater Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
11 years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
in addition to him , a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the in@@ timi@@ dated torture , has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen .
the audience , about 40 persons , is almost seized by Stev@@ ens .
he tells of various locations , which he repeatedly records on the map , regarding his minim@@ alism and art arranged songs .
where they were created and what it looks like , in his hom@@ eland .
since then Stev@@ ens has been a wonder@@ fully creative Irish .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; presents their wis@@ ely composed songs that can be harmon@@ ious very close to American folk &amp; late six@@ ties but at any time they can drift .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a for@@ ging series : each of the 50 U.S. states must be discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but already in 2004 and in the Rhine near you have already been &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; and breaks even a positive trend .
reduced Stev@@ ens look here .
live on him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician turns back to the series in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens En@@ ter You To : come on Fe@@ el The &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) appears to be celebrated in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ b@@ ating ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in none of the most influ@@ ential musical education in any year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) , extensive electronic delay pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth ordinary studio album is still broad orchest@@ rates , but by program sequences or st@@ ats , plays with all manner of effect and rever@@ b .
from far the smaller clubs , the stage shows are exhibited here with the colorful spectac@@ le of Neon @-@ Stir@@ n@@ b@@ bands and a large fluorescent stage .
latest touring Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens as part of a five @-@ member band across Germany .
in the dark , Hamburger Dun@@ es More !
theat@@ res mainly exhibits this since March &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell . &quot;
although there are almost 2000 guests are banned in their seats , Stev@@ ens turn back to in@@ tim@@ acy and for folk music .
without raising a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays in the wide @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can listen to the audience : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they could therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just at a en@@ core , Stev@@ ens felt modest , plays acoustic only a few older songs and ultimately ten@@ ds to ro@@ aring Ap@@ pl@@ aus .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fre@@ unde
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has been e@@ ager@@ ly awa@@ ited by the Prime Minister &apos;s fre@@ unde .
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fre@@ unde turn and head with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is set to rise to the first of his six pre@@ defined questions shortly after mid@@ day , with its capacity is likely to be controlled by the media and the Labour MEP .
he called &quot; fewer Theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary inspection for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because they come after his appointment as a member of the Shadow chassis and after his speech at the TU@@ C @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of Labour Party , on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Sil@@ ence , prov@@ oked the criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S and reveals the focus of several championships of Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has drawn attention to itself
he said Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , he would have stood in a respec@@ t@@ ful silence , and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he had come to sing the Labour Party , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shade ministers have refused to serve at Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns top team , and they are called to differenti@@ ate the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party was originally supported as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent in the BBC Robin Bran@@ t claims that political dis@@ agreements are reflected in terms of &quot; Labour &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns post@@ ings to the European Union and the limitation in winn@@ ings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour proposes in order to remove the entire idea of a limited total limit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labor and pen@@ sions ministers , said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it only government &apos;s government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been CEO of T@@ ory , in the last decade on the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , which has promised a different policies of politics , says that he has given the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crow@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions of Mr. Cameron and given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the fre@@ unde of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ally and that he will be subjected to both &quot; dr@@ au@@ ness &quot; and the battle with re@@ lin@@ ens and instead has to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the sh@@ adows business minister , will represent him if he is not participating - for example , when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also has the idea that other colleagues shift the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ lic@@ t , the spokes@@ man for the house , to do the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he would be tied up by the policy in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per &quot; Theatre , who is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s welfare . but a few years later he had dre@@ amt of being at it .
as she was first sent in television in 1990 , the round was viewed by Prime Minister as the most important Bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his position among his parliamentary resolution , although critics argu@@ ed , had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and a broad@@ ening re@@ forms .

the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of Ri@@ val@@ en AB In@@ Be@@ v .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill claims that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater bu@@ oy@@ ancy of potential customers could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it would be in@@ prob@@ able that this purchasing power will be the higher operating costs in his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans by J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

Met@@ cash kick@@ ed ground combat campaign for fighting Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fest@@ ation
met@@ a tries to protect the IG@@ A branch from a Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ ers has started a flo@@ od@@ ation campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia as ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di @-@ invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets have prepared their relationships with local food suppliers and manufacture the IG@@ A through mainst@@ re@@ am Marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealer and suppliers j@@ ump@@ ed on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ manufacturer Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in IG@@ A @-@ stores samples and Lad@@ en@@ owners who sell tickets for the South Australian soccer league in loy@@ al customers .
a cash @-@ further details of its Defence strategy is expected to be released on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers on food , alcohol and devices will be through its annual Invest@@ ors strategy game .
it is much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A charges and higher profit margin as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
shop@@ pers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ic provincial , and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , anal@@ ysts agree as Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di has taken away twelve months after opening of his first markets , about five percent of the food market in these two states , and will predominantly remove independent retailers worldwide .
according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ z of Morgan Stanley declared that IG@@ A retailers can lose $ 360 million in sales per year and met@@ a $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 branches in WA and will generate revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food products and food at the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed base could cost around $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ z said .
at the same time , Met@@ illa &apos;s market share loses in eastern states , mainly alongside Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A @-@ buyers were the loy@@ est .
Morgan Stanley holds that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in the food and food market grew by 3.8 percent in 2016 , at 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and to reduce market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading F@@ ond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business service in Melbourne , that Met@@ ers probably will disappear within a decade .
met@@ cash refused to respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board has contact Mr Dou@@ glass with Mr Dou@@ glass this week .
IG@@ As market share has been decl@@ ining from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and food trade , which is about 1,200 percent in 2012 , has fallen by 43 percent , refle@@ cting the operative debt reduction of same pressure on turnover and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers negoti@@ ates itself and invests more than 150 million $ in order to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week to improve fresh foods and provide a better selection of private label food@@ stuffs .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main legal leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop re@@ compens@@ ations will be transfer@@ ed and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 .
Tan@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis network Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ asi in kin@@ c@@ ac@@ is deser@@ ves praise to be the cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
Tan@@ asi Co@@ at@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ alised damages &quot; in the shorter storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deser@@ ved his view to the president of the Australian tennis club Steve Heal@@ y rather praise for his own behaviour .
co@@ ca@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; , came down by the not@@ orious con@@ front@@ ation of Cy@@ ril and St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the lim@@ el@@ ight .
in a fier@@ y quali@@ fier in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , soon after co@@ ca@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to dis@@ appearing twice with the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison had to sm@@ ashed away with Har@@ rison : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA had to sm@@ ashed away , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was last seen , when he defeated a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ f turned into a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by Heal@@ y .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I &apos;m quite excited , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was pulled down a bit in the dispute , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
he has broken one bat , when he lost a ra@@ cket at the US Open , but he is not the first player that has broken up a bat of fru@@ stration among themselves , and I know the Tan@@ asi enough to know that he is not proud of them .
but , truly , it really proved himself in the US Open extremely well , even under the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he earned a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around itself , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little too severe .
he is a very rei@@ vious 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and it has never been a problem with the other players , he is trained tough , it is good in form , it is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think it deser@@ ved it after his own publisher .
Heal@@ y also supported the decision to take account by Kyr@@ gios in the important decision failed on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everybody , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term solid part of the team .
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the tro@@ se circles around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I believe Nick very quickly gave rise to climb , what people did feel like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray in his eyes , but we try to under@@ stand@@ able it ? some time outside the ramp , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declared emer@@ gen@@ cies , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency bed and locking the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday . he held everything that tried to reach illegal into the land . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border , hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land gathering the indig@@ nation against the indig@@ nation .
people fled from force , who had fled the violence in a well @-@ known time on the road between the two control points of the country and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations went up .
when a police helicopter had compassion on them , the migrants &quot; opened the fron@@ tier ! &quot; and they cried out against the Hungarian Sl@@ ing@@ o@@ ei .
some meadows from protest food and water back .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; in@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants would send back migrants from Hungary to arrive more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral .
it must be held convers@@ ations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic , in Prague .
the tur@@ bul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serb border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a controversi@@ al meeting in Brussels .
the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were refuge in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they claimed their hope that eventually - next month , or until end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU countries would receive another 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria desired a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immig@@ ration crisis of the continent .
in Hungary , however , Hungary gains its hopes on a bal@@ ancing action from Brussels or its neigh@@ bors .
the emergency in two south regions called authorities to obtain more powers to get the crisis in two southern regions , so that they could accelerate roads and accelerate their asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country has also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire through its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the land - after it has ended a fence at the Serb border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that some prison in@@ mates were used to create a bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in recent months Hungary is for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , a substantial bott@@ len@@ eck and an entrance point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban took insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic crops are in search of a better life , and not war@@ fare , are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the cross the border or damaged by the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence to build the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put higher adhes@@ ion for the tra@@ der tra@@ der .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency state , &quot; said Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs reputation in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for the next week , but re@@ por@@ ters from Associated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on day@@ time .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , the country &apos;s security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come on by destro@@ ying the fence , they are now in custody and are accused of off@@ ences against the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border check@@ operations with Serbia , after an ambul@@ ance ended with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos re@@ issued the most important border crossing at Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a dig@@ nity in order to push it down .
we managed to enter for around 20 , but thousands of stay remained outside .
another group of immig@@ rants is the main highway associated with Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse to use them for food and water until they can travel to Hungary .
election cycle 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s decision contra@@ sted S@@ anders against Ber@@ nie S@@ anders
former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
Clinton has now reached the support of 47 percent of democratic voters during the pre @-@ elections ( 58 per cent earlier ) while S@@ anders is on the second position , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced his presidential election for the presidential election , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate in the elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the preliminary election , most democratic voters say that it &apos;s too early to say that their minds will determine which candidates will be supported .
but Clin@@ t Supp@@ orters are more constant as one of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ Survey , Clinton has lost a series of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders had achieved some profits .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and temper@@ ate , but these pre@@ jumps have decreased .
their support in the men has dropped sharp@@ ly , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points behind .
Clin@@ t advantage of democratic elec@@ tors under 50 years of age have pl@@ ough@@ ed , and they are now at the same height .
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older elec@@ tors .
in the past month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit advantage in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
roughly half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections nationwide say that they would support people with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some pre @-@ keeping and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidates .
they would not support six percent .
maybe it is not surprising that Clin@@ t current supporters are especially thr@@ illed by her .
the belie@@ fs are stronger with those who are currently not support Clinton - just about a quarter would support it .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , they say less Republi@@ can voters think about their peak current Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ t supporters are asked in an open question , why they want the candidates that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that they are the best candidates for the job ( 10 percent ) .
each Bill Clinton &apos;s association is also mentioned in Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent for dealing with the problems and the elec@@ l@@ ability may also be quoted .
as the vice president claimed a potential for the Presi@@ dential Office of the Military Order , 57 per cent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - though a third is believed to do it .
if Democratic Vot@@ ers are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , is bi@@ ds at the top .
by Clin@@ t supporters more than half that Bi@@ den had the second choice far ahead of others .
the Bi@@ den , not for nom@@ ination of the Democrats , will continuously increase Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , of 20 points with a jum@@ per in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters think Clinton had the best chances of winning the election , but has fallen this figure of 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den has a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; selectable &quot; has gone up .
nevertheless , in question after this , what is more important for a candidates , Democratic Vot@@ ers asked questions about the elec@@ l@@ ability .
similarly as in the last month , the only demo@@ c@@ rat@@ ory candidate or a candidate candidate for those voters are un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates take good results in some important features of voters in their party .
reas@@ on@@ ably consider Clinton , S@@ anders and tru@@ thful and tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy with strong guide positions .
Bi@@ den cuts the top three candidates in honor while Clin@@ t strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters think that Clinton is genu@@ in@@ ely and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have his mind of him .
Democratic voters of the former elections see also Clinton , S@@ anders and biograph@@ ical in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements about a quarter of the democratic voters did not make any opinion about S@@ anders .
given any questions on Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Secretary of State , most of the Democratic Vot@@ ers are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
the half of the Americans is not satisfied with their explanation , while only one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came into the light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on her general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated by her .
there are mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse than Clinton .
although Clinton is considered to be hon@@ est and trusted by the voters of their party , this will continue to see a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent see her as a hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month , and 15 points less since May .
62 % of voters are not entitled to a resident and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to voters see Tr@@ ump as no hon@@ est and un@@ tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , will receive good notes on the lead .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son , and Bush will be best when being hon@@ esty .
a majority does not seem to be hon@@ est , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters during the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son , approaching by the national pol@@ l near Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates , half of voters in the new survey , and others lose more dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters still support tr@@ ump in large numbers . 23 % of the last month &apos;s C@@ BS @-@ survey conducted between Fox News Conference last month , and 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son poured out 6 % on 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son sur@@ passes well with demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ pass the ump under Republi@@ can elec@@ tors with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ or John Kas@@ i , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins and Scott Walker , who fell the deepest point in the last month to now 2 % in the last month .
the former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e , and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio can be reached with 6 % on the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 376 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son got up with 19 % support in Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also demonstrated Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
at a glance at one of the last week Pis@@ ces , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ th@@ iev@@ es for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze through faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the last Saturday during a campaign to perform in I@@ owa .

even if the top values are measured only in distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing people to take hot water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood cul@@ min@@ ated with the death of an Baruch College in Ne@@ ul@@ ings
for almost two years , after a student at a student bearing in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ dest@@ al will compl@@ ain against five people .
in September 2013 , members of the New York &apos;s Baruch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood was brut@@ aly attacked and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death the police .
officials said that he had been loaded up with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly has been attacked while he tried to al@@ locate a frozen field on the goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood did not call the emergency number 911 after den@@ ying den@@ sely and waited an hour before they brought him into a hospital so the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police department Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this point , members of U@@ ten@@ sil@@ ien came to hide and the result of the bro@@ therhood is generally spoken by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Police Cl@@ ef Wagner , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died in the morning next morning to his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g were repeatedly treated with m@@ ute power injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family moved to a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bru@@ der@@ ships and their members need to be considered ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury from Monroe received an accus@@ ation for murder of the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with religious attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to make persons responsible for the involved persons , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - this sanctions , so we will also move these to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Baruch College had forbidden the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood has contra@@ di@@ ct their affili@@ ation into the local group .
it will happen if the F@@ ed increases its interest
interest @-@ interest income is , and the house will be refu@@ elled into stri@@ ve , and the economy will rise to bonds , and the economy will lead to a recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know how long will it take and how long will it stop .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only low guide to the drain .
a recession triggered a recession within just 11 months following the initial full interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ vity of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , if it is not always a factor of how the economy and the financial investments are react .
hence the representative of the US bank was so fierce that investors should not focus on what they begin to increase interest rates , rather much on the period that is required for normal@@ ization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could see that all the exc@@ itement was possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated due to an interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is interpreted in@@ sof@@ ten by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inexpensive money &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication on customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the US interest to normal levels , but still at a low level , in order to give a seism@@ ic shock that seem to be afraid .
however , this does not mean that there is no effect .
here &apos;s a look at historical trends , looking out how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate hike can make things for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently there is quite a trend that wealth was contra@@ cted from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps refle@@ cting the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what had happened to interest @-@ interest in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest @-@ rate hike , rather flat in the 250 days after an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent , with an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent , with an average return on Nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to appear later in increases in increases and the return margin begins to decrease .
recipes are a fact of economic life , but interest @-@ rate enh@@ ances them often .
in the current case the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions who did not give it before and accelerate the recession .
it is extremely interesting that the gross domestic product will be in the vicinity of its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , it was only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015 , only few in the third quarter will wait and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
interest @-@ rate hike in such frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and ask the question whether this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made the whole year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were judged at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could find an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all of the increases in increases from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing weak@@ nesses of the GDP and on @-@ rec@@ ession@@ ist heights very quickly after the start of recovery in the sh@@ adows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
contrary to this , this is a clearly slow recovery of what is the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is far by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and these are now 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ at@@ l as the market will im@@ print an interest @-@ rate , and the pattern is quite similar as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than shares , change their strategic course .
in bonds the R@@ end@@ ites seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle is performed .
at the end of the launch cycle , the balance bike immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the increase in interest rates will lead to the fact that yields between longer and shorter stays closer together and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing curve .
highly interest bonds often bring in such a climate better income , even though &quot; we are still careful to anticip@@ ate higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Anal@@ yst@@ in in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
what is interesting , Jones says that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy @-@ expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the starch of the dollar and the decline of the inflation series there are some signs that the market has adapted to the positive monetary policy in the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the Er@@ trag@@ ic@@ ur@@ ve has gone up , lending has widened , and the volume has risen - all the features of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the big and entire company , companies are aiming to wrap up the larger part of their business activities in the USA , including interest rates , and local products will be even more attractive .
multin@@ ational corpor@@ ations with high debts are worse than a rising dollar of their products in the global market , and as well as financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story below shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks are ten@@ ds to respond well to an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ anal@@ ysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report for the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet represented companies with a weak balance after each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volume balance in their shares , also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure shar@@ ehol@@ ding , consumers are also benef@@ iting from the increasing metrop@@ olis .
as@@ par@@ agus can see profits by higher yields , even if experts are different , how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , member of the parliamentary member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative members of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argu@@ ed that it is not to distinguish any of the commerci@@ ally available rival ri@@ vals .
he also imp@@ acted to the BBC Music Awards and said they only cited The Br@@ its
parliament @-@ collector Dam@@ ien Collins The programme The Voice on and said that this was not so original .
BBC Radio 3 , &quot; changing &quot; in Classic FM , asser@@ ts itself an important parliamentary member and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that does not do the private broad@@ caster .
the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public broad@@ caster &apos;s broad@@ caster &quot; become stup@@ id , &quot; and increasingly want to distinguish any more from its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; stup@@ id &quot; but it seems to be transformed to Classic FM . &quot; he said .
he also died at the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be merely a name to The Br@@ its .
so , if you try to do something different - this are two spontan@@ e@@ ously called examples of which you &apos;re actually only im@@ it@@ ating what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director pointed out the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 will fly far ahead of its commercial compet@@ itor if it comes to the public and clari@@ fication of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is an commitment to live music and musicians that is truly un@@ surpassed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and works new works , I also have really important for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that har@@ der will be used to eng@@ age the audience as it did so in the past , because the British had been informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element in BBC production , which during the hearing held in the Committee on the Vari@@ ations of Culture , Media , and Sports , under fire , became the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MPs Dam@@ ien Collins Pro The Voice to - the musical talent show of BBC , who was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pe@@ at for the estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
LORD Hall was making a BBC 1 show that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as the Judge - &quot; a special BBC mode &quot; produced .
he added , he wishes to find the company &quot; a hit from our own barn , &quot; when it is the next time an entertainment series .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from other rows of The Voice in future or give money of past@@ ures to other entert@@ aining formats .
net sales grew in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the past month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to purchase
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed in November
for over one decade the virtual One has bent , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost .
however , experts predi@@ ct that there are evidence that online sales were stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 with just five percent increase from the previous year .
experts predi@@ ct that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , then that in the course of time , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the W@@ RG @-@ sale index , said to the Guardian .
he declared that the online sales increased by more than three years ago , as a buyer with its mobile phones began to make purchases .
it meant that more people could online shopping online and that people could do this in different environments , for instance at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes itself , and we will see that growth is decreased .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the following revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold its purchases at the last Friday in November .
last year this arte were five times the average number of buyers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer sites fell down .
experts believe that Black Friday , who could manage buyers were able to make purchases of buyers , buyers will make purchases of buyers .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that from £ 5 spending a bit more than £ 1 is online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than a third of purchases now are operated via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of man &apos;s clothing and shoes are buying online rather than in the inner cities .

Saudi @-@ Official states have already been ple@@ dged that the H@@ add@@ sch after Mec@@ ca with thousands of people continue to come on to the city will continue to pass on .
today , king Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group could not have the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree that was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the failure .
the language speaking service of the news agency that this detail did not say , however , that the leadership of the company going abroad must be prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man revealed un@@ veil , which pl@@ ung@@ ed the fall of the crane , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has published no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Decree also imp@@ acted the group because of non @-@ current security measures , because they have not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes in Mec@@ ca Greater Eindhoven are part of the massive construction project that is managed by the Bin Laden Group .

B &amp; Q boss says that the time of the cheapest Eastern European crafts@@ man is past .
Brit@@ ons become increasingly crafts@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has an increase behind him
this leads to the fact that 200 further screening shops that were selected to tra@@ des@@ men should be opened .
simultaneously King@@ F@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q sales points to be closed on country
from Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chief @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Britain will perform their hammers and brush in favour of the use of qualified e@@ art@@ e@@ art@@ is@@ ans taking home their home in their home .
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to protect walls , you still belong to a minority today .
for Br@@ its employ more crafts@@ men to perform DIY jobs in their houses , as the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ F@@ isher , which owns the tree carrier chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services to deep prices are out@@ dated .
in this reason , King@@ F@@ isher , 200 other screens therefore plans to open a large number of tra@@ des@@ men and close to 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said that they are spending more women in B &amp; Q shop , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment , the men were silent .
she said that it is necessary to have the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branch .
we must move this stronger to balance .
basically , half of our customers from women are made by 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision making .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women on the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also declared its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the teams with women including his management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious ruling - variety is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher applied for a decline in the semi @-@ annual profit and restructuring , after the Group &apos;s expense for the loss of shops .
because of this trends , King@@ F@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new stores .
officials of A@@ I / D@@ ob because of un@@ faithful court
on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian volleyball vic@@ tor A@@ I / D@@ ob have to respond to un@@ faithful and dispens@@ ing education .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also indicted for crimes abuse .
he was acquitted of all charges in May and has been en@@ for@@ ce@@ able in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had emerged in the preliminary investigation that the accused were used in 2006 to 2011 by the United States of United States , on which they were used to spontan@@ eous purposes for private purposes .
with approximately 400.000 euros , this is worth the damage .
the sports functional will also be charged because of financial intermedi@@ aries .
this presi@@ dency was divided by the chair@@ woman of the open@@ er , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
the def@@ endant of the Un@@ faithful presented the defence that the association had developed at no time an asset after the association .
the sports would have had only bud@@ get@@ ed damage and the sports club , which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested in the amount of time and money from the debt - the Passi@@ va had approximately 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( about 44@@ ,000 euros ) .
at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; we continue our club on or un@@ lock us ? &quot; , one of the def@@ endants , in the bread chan@@ ges@@ e , said the financial advisor .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take these task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to lay down our life insurance policies , as security of the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the rede@@ em@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money free , except it may only be done no debt .
in addition , with the corresponding financial statements , the payout of the allowance prior to 1991 was adopted .
therefore , one part of the fee would be cancelled only years later , namely , from 2003 , when an increase was off on the account .
this means that the former el@@ mann would like to clari@@ fy the package deals and not detail .
the two def@@ endants were shared between the two accused , accused of accused of accused .
why the dis@@ bur@@ s@@ ements of the association did not be expressed in detail , asked whether the judge asked .
the association did not find out in detail for the financial institution , important to freedom of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , when a func@@ tionary defense began to use an investig@@ ational investigation , the amount of $ 120,000 was transferred to the Association account .
these were the accused , they declared the accused .
this amount was based on the name of the second accused and not known by the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
I knew the proof too long for a long time .
then he thought that he believed that it was the best for the club .
if something happened to it , nobody knew something of that money , the prosecutor posed in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , just@@ i@@ fying the function .
this bank was formulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;

the first def@@ endant , he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of them from the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard contains another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff reduction of the company , the computer giant will build further jobs in the financial breakdown of the company for three years .
the job st@@ ables in the US computer giant H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) are no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US @-@ technology group plans to dis@@ close the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers .

time of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ banknote
the world has observed when the U.S. exp@@ bank is on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important choice if for the first time since almost one decade will have raised the interest or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were inter@@ viewed by Reuters , found that a little more than half , which was still last week of view , that the F@@ ed will do something longer than now , and the interest rates on the current level of 0 @-@ 0.25 per cent will hold .
it is a historical event since it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est on NU@@ LL .
for the first time we approach to a situation in which a large central bank may not leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alis@@ ing interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is at a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate just a low inflation .
however the F@@ ed cannot ignore a slight focus on global circumstances .
it warned of the markets that indicate an increase , but the signs indicate that the opportunities are well @-@ suited for such a step .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
death support at the Delta State University , leave prior to notice
following the shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues on Monday , and killed , Sh@@ annon clearly wrote a notice that he could ask him for him &quot; for the first murder and wanted to do it , &quot; he could not make it free , &quot; issued authority on Tuesday .
the police in C@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb is a teacher of ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 on the Monday morning .
and he said , he shot on someone and killed one .
in 2011 the staff of the emergency call said that police officers had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was watching my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house , but he is no distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but most likely will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked for his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
no declaration had no explanation for his shots .
when the police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry that I wanted , I could do it .
I loved A@@ my , and she &apos;s the only woman that loved me . &quot;
after writing the notice , record reports of 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday night when police officers assassin@@ ated him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he caught nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was a little bit of Mr Lam@@ inate idea . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ bite also had a relationship to him , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ ent@@ bite was told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ am , who said they were married for about seven years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ er said he and Pr@@ ent@@ knew would have a daughter who is 19 , and it was destroyed by the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ less had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ er@@ iss worked online from home , according to the testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified as a close gir@@ l@@ friend of Pr@@ ent@@ bite from Sun Her@@ ald .
Know@@ les told that Pr@@ ent@@ bite that had a dog named Light@@ ning , who had met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help others to help others , &quot; says Know@@ les
the police said that linked to them at a particular point on Monday , to tell them , &quot; he doesn &apos;t go to prison . &quot;
when polic@@ emen visited him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lamb opened his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , a PhD obtained from the Delta State University , awarded a PhD in the University of the University .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play for months due to double fac@@ tual
Luke Sha@@ w failed with the Champions League @-@ defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven a double member of its right B@@ one .
while this is the left of the left def@@ ending and made him for at least six months of play , Louis van G@@ aal doesn &apos;t give the hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a back@@ drop of H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was built in the PS@@ V range .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being transferred to the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg extension and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be post@@ pon@@ ed tomorrow , or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who goes with 18 to Manchester United , it really hard and then fantastic , and then it happens .
in the dressing unit he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor but if you have a double fac@@ tor@@ ch , then it takes the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he could play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and the suspension of a man .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican of the Mexican .
van G@@ aal saw that the Italian refer@@ ee had gone ast@@ ray .
you can ass@@ ure for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card are due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws Account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to the gen@@ esis begins now , I &apos;m coming again back . &quot;
similarly : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
the England Defender has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for the championship with the European Championship in France , to recover from the end of June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; it is a serious bre@@ aches . &quot;
when a player leaves this kind of injury in this kind , they are all very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our player to viol@@ ate a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg in Mexico against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Bo@@ omer@@ ang Championships in 2014 .
&quot; he &apos;s very hard , because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and when you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , it is not good , &quot; said Coc@@ o .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing that I could see was the ball , it was in another direction , so that it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like it can be as hard as I can .
I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also served in the hospital - based on a roll @-@ off of Chris D@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost completely .
it may be , you might be David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care system to name his favorite child book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax decided to print on the label of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult election , writing Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camp@@ s , and goes on : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead , gives a check mark of the movie version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to extend the pretty short original text .
in the heart of the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commod@@ ity , hop@@ ed a boy named T@@ ed , seeing their desire to see a real tree , &quot; he was to read . a lov@@ em@@ aking of love was Dr. se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that is not yet suspected enough : the text by Cameron stands in some cases how the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commod@@ ity , hopes a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the woman of his dreams . &quot;
even though he de@@ pri@@ ved to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron triggered the action of the book so little familiar , like the local environment through the cov@@ et@@ ousness , trees that are stri@@ cken , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , b@@ low@@ ish beings , &quot; which speaks under the name of the trees , &quot; which is devast@@ ated in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task is assigned to a volunte@@ er , who had not read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ person said that the text had probably come by Cam@@ er@@ on elec@@ toral body .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of cam@@ er@@ ons staff was delivered , but had no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was definitely threatened by the exclusion from the German team , but it is still difficult
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you selected the cad@@ res , the England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series loss is not on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a down victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Site may possibly be experienced less than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing schedule , and the community is strong ; they will not wear an@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ punch and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he identi@@ fies an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
this news is : Adam Ly@@ th finds out from the England @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader , and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to compens@@ ate Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , heavily .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ players are on results .
there was no question mark by Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I have said this - players are their own best selection .
long ago , it had been prolonged the run of Ly@@ ub@@ i , but he had the control of his own dest@@ iny .
if he hop@@ efully further strikes in Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his position even though he had not so good achievements , and it is not surprised : it is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test score will get to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ dia won seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son ahead of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was 9 .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down .
the only throwing one can rise , was that England has first claimed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ ub@@ in was top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es come in , and he &apos;s a b@@ ats@@ man , whom I don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s an X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ric , what we seen in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , what met us very .
it must be at least equal opportunities such as those received before it , but this depends on the team@@ work in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next Cook can beat what an extra @-@ spin bow@@ ler and get four cr@@ ush@@ es got up , and I did nothing about it .
I do not see why a b@@ ats@@ man cannot beat there , and this left hand has shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ l of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een , perhaps did not get his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is no number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests during the first drop before he joined as Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately managed three hundred R@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the K@@ ader than back @-@ up @-@ Sp@@ inner , and in my limited relationship with him , he has very impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup s@@ inn@@ s who have raised their hands and the coach have op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few wise additions of the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ is , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , served as a consultant for the test games could be a master review .
he is one of the nic@@ est cores of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences since it has played under all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball end of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the International Cri@@ cket Competition , as a player or coach , and as Mah@@ ela has he inten@@ tions , of which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can fresh in the dressing room fresh breeze , even if the messages are in tune with the before .
coll@@ ys Team@@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and i for my part I have no problem with this .
some are not true , but Co@@ aches and Team interpre@@ ter will not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as in the players stick their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not taken in ordinary heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out@@ side Britain &apos;s from the EU ) might gain ad@@ missible if the economy was sl@@ ack@@ ed into a dol@@ drums by 2017 .
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ sealed new bar@@ gain strategy to keep Britain in the EU - even without the election of great Jeremy &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was heavy on Tuesday through Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ y said that some member states , so deeply ro@@ red in various cr@@ ises , as the EU has now created and not always from their own fault , Great Britain himself created agenda with over@@ ly conc@@ essions and bo@@ oming contract changes , which they usually don &apos;t want to get full .
in Brigh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided at the annual meeting that it may not may , if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance will climb in summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capital cities - a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come to the house and say that they &apos;ll win allies for re@@ forms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes for a outside of Britain in the EU &apos;s Zel@@ otes , &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets say that more and more short @-@ saf@@ est minister and civil servants have come to the point in which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or leaving .
Germany is c@@ auti@@ ous female Chancellor Angela Merkel , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks good for it as it is for ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande has his re @-@ election to his re @-@ election in 2017 .
he is also a flo@@ res@@ sive strength .
Poland may soon see a national@@ ist right government , in Spain a left .
it &apos;s difficult to imagine that they should pl@@ uck up a leg that should be used better for the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Brit@@ ons , the Scotland Aus@@ itt was forced to prevent the UK from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want for the most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies .
hence , some of such ministers therefore probably plan to recover helpful remarks , all in the SN@@ P style , while British in the UK coach @-@ campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ ite process , assumed my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the negoti@@ ation was a ple@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing worth of the negoti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how to burn down the Fle@@ et Street to their costs and what EU Sk@@ ep@@ tics is the Oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Press Card , as they were inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspired speakers in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
it can be weak for Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Opp@@ ortun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ ies .
all its tra@@ verse revealed Ed Mil@@ i@@ band who had his enemies .
this includes the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ thr@@ illing @-@ barri@@ ers , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners , and the pseud@@ o non @-@ foreigners who have most of our large papers .
in fact , Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but that if you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you can put better chains to give him , instead of to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ i@@ band had more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air itself when he was opposed to the rule of Cam@@ er@@ on , for Bl@@ air had rejected the principle above not adopted the Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
the press never has to draw him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly re@@ aps on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time for me to desp@@ ise - seems to repeat a mistake at that time , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take time but it has to develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe - I press it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ de tendency and the wil@@ ds of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can certainly say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary , &quot; A ben@@ n , &quot; but not a Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in Radio und on TV this week said , when the boy@@ sc@@ outs was fought in it , does not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s appointment of prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a pe@@ ach@@ builder , bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father stri@@ pped himself in television , due to his Labour cable @-@ mate to go far too far and to lose his cabin job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was more attractive .
but he strug@@ gling to stay in &quot; under any circumstances - Ben@@ ch &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said that what J@@ C told his fellow Armed Forces and M@@ EPs on Monday evening after all reports .
whatever I want to mediate the gl@@ ands bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even has touched me - News Dis@@ cipl@@ ine remains in the Age of TV around the clock and in all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding place of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .
it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe allowing him to hold Lab@@ ours Support in the Refer@@ end@@ ental Campa@@ ign for a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility how Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins always remember .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental vac@@ u@@ ities on the EU membership - in line with its Ben@@ n@@ ite Bel@@ con economy , its anti @-@ capitalist history - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ er@@ ical discussion under his left hand @-@ pre@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small under@@ taking is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute .

however , some researchers have asked the loading capacity of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial department published in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , initiated the &quot; exceptionally powerful basis , &quot; based on the P@@ he &apos;s most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers have write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ J &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ idemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ate that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of re@@ mot@@ ions and modelling .
indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ critical criteria ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions about the damage of several nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were reported in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting is a company called by Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose management had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T in public health in a sustainability report , said it .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared that means of an e @-@ cigarette producer , but not the financing , which he has received after reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , have added it .
the reasons for the selection of members of the committee are not supplied , but includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarette champion , some of which also specify a lot of industries in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco check .
the meetings took part in the meeting also in the meeting .
the research work of the Group is indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these coupl@@ ings or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; no evidence exists that &quot; there are no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking did . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J has had previously re@@ acted to the claim of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers die at its ad@@ dic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence shows that health risks of E @-@ cigarettes in comparison are small , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ he has the great obligation to open the public opinion about what evidence of proof and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative d@@ angers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80.000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking will cost $ 2 billion per year in the National Health system .
due to the clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking by smoking , we fulfil our national competence .
BBC shou@@ ldn &apos;t give East@@ er@@ ders , former CEO of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop working programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial gi@@ val &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the sightseeing fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent through other UK channels .
he critic@@ ized the BBC for that it &apos;s public @-@ legal programmes that probably could probably be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ cont@@ est@@ able time window opposed to the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals , and radio such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more into partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC when he was six years in channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC programs would be on job or send it clearly by sub@@ sid@@ y ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus Communic@@ ating Committee within the framework of its study on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the sightseeing fee , which do not want to keep medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least make its production at least for programs that do not want to do or in order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a broad support of their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is naturally non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ im@@ sive control programs that could be financed even without subsidi@@ zation could be financed .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ poin@@ ter is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both of self @-@ productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I ende@@ av@@ oured to see how that public television is supposed to be public .
I don &apos;t think that the BBC would reduce the BBC .
Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC ow@@ d was on the hunt for reviews , &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC will return , what is the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows had to sell as East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal nature programs &quot; at BB@@ C4 , where people can not measure the audience , but they can argu@@ ed when they go to their apparently sacred missions for just@@ ify the just@@ ification of 4 billion £ Radio charges , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ents programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where nobody wanted to see it .
for the radio fee , Johnson said the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value in this .
of course you think all , we think all that one receives a great value for 150 £ every year here , but for people who &apos;s £ 150 a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss , David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday asked that the BBC should review and maintain their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission . &quot;
he said , only little from the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio . it should inform yourself in the public @-@ legal tel@@ ev@@ ances in Australia and Canada . for example , do you want to clari@@ fy and entert@@ ained . &quot;
to question the partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas as those of the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only one hand@@ ful in television are shown , and with the commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances will be able to make all online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ dri@@ et@@ ics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the N@@ emat@@ odes change it at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have controlled wor@@ ms with genet@@ ically modified nerve systems to be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny N@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they have taken for high frequencies for the human ear to be heard , radi@@ ated and radi@@ ated .
im@@ pulses work through the turn of Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells , which are genet@@ ically modified to produce the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asound waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers told , the wor@@ ms presented the power of a new method , called Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics , used in ultr@@ asound to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Srebrenica municipality in La J@@ olla , California , &quot; The Guardian at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , the electrical im@@ pulses in the brain &apos;s brain for treating Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
fen@@ ug@@ gets are usually not respond to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani showed that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , intensi@@ fy the ultr@@ asound waves , that enter into wor@@ ms .
enhanced ultr@@ asound scan on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ ary channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound waves prop@@ el the opening of these idle channels and activate the cells , which they are allocated so a report of Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asound @-@ controlled N@@ emat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms that some of its Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 em@@ eral channels can carry .
when he creates ultr@@ asound at the changed creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ beings and to the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed m@@ one@@ ur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a ground@@ breaking tool that scientists set up and off neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ dri@@ et@@ ics could have some advantages compared to this technology .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down in a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asound heads can be caused without hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from top to the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that , with gen@@ ome and a therapeutic antibody , it is possible to temporarily distur@@ bing the ultr@@ asound signal for a clinical signal for certain neuro@@ logical treatments &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bh@@ as@@ ani &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
11 years ago , I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the cl@@ amped specimen of those I have ge@@ ared - and to the numerous , durable complaints well over others .
most of what I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight basic rules .
the entry in student residence halls reaches from easy lifting of up to absolute sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to sp@@ y : people tell whence you come if you stand on the Sabbath year , and why you don &apos;t love the Sabbath year , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a He@@ fe@@ eb@@ h@@ ah@@ aha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe out through .
help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it guides the conversation and helps you to find out human beings , which you would not speak contrary to those with which you would not speak , even when your lashes were extingu@@ ished , and this fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let humans see .
the rooms of people often transform into drinks , film night event locations and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people move on and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
this is thinking about it : do not remember to start the Uni with a relationship
introduction represented a rough treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ em@@ mel culture , which is friendly and soci@@ ally can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing within the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to pass through our friendship , but you have to go away , that I may draw the energy , which I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ it@@ it@@ ones of soci@@ al@@ izing is exhau@@ sted - and send SMS messages instead .
A@@ pro@@ po@@ s anchor : do it .
a guy in my student dor@@ ms had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close by baking .
since you begin the University in the high point of the back @-@ Man@@ ie , the clo@@ ds to the doors of men to imagine even with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have something sweet to you . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade le@@ ak@@ rooms offer is a good way to close friends .
their roomm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain and become associate with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course this depends on whether you are a constant b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ums@@ y from flour , sugar and fat , make that people sleeping , when you ank@@ le it .
food to steal , is a consistent crime in student residence .
of course , the cl@@ aws of chickens is a theft , but is it the take a drop Mil@@ k for your tea ?
check it with the dairy farm .
the chances are getting that they are talking to use even if they cook in the inside .
if any man tells you , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my co @-@ feeling - but try to deal with it as my roomm@@ ates , which added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ cture with th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
they should make no noise , the people of sleep , or of work .
it &apos;s not only therefore to be a permanent man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the prover@@ b to men who sit in the glass of glass .
a girl on my corridor had her neighbours , if there is something like to make them something lighter , drum &amp; bass is a bit more quiet , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with still loud music .
when they finally heard at 5 o &apos;clock they left her neigh@@ bors who were still sleeping two hours before she left their own music . she completed her door and went to her three hour examination .
would it be romantic , if your future partner would be able to move into the same student residence hall ?
again , it would be not deep @-@ deep if you have a roomm@@ ates for your future sp@@ ouse in which she wants to take and see them every day and perhaps bring together all common friends to join them ?
of course the heart goes by his own ways - but if a hot Mit@@ t is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse in , try at least to speak a little mind in your pay@@ day .
at the very exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his key in his not closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing circle is less than it seems .
a good thing is funny , but it takes only moments until he gets to the brook .
divide by po@@ ds a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never swe@@ at any of your room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put into the freezer - but drives their owners on the ceiling not more than twice .
H@@ ousing Complex for Refu@@ ge@@ es , sole , Ger@@ n@@ im@@ bal@@ er
the real estate owner Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on a Central Fran@@ ental Eck@@ ental Complex for people who have not much money .
so for as for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the m@@ ight@@ ful mother and the fer@@ rat@@ es@@ n@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how to easily build and easily build this day , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees are dr@@ unken in the apartment market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on how much cheaper living space can be created : it builds in a project of terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ gen , many refugees have been dr@@ unken on the apartment market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ ded : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people are staying at a large part here .
in view of the refugee &apos;s electricity , we also need enough living room for decades in the coming decades .
a whole , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ ded : a row house needs the least place .
it simpli@@ fies the integration .
that is different when people enter into blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be changed according to the needs of the needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ ded : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 Euros , excluding land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted for six months .
that is reasonable .
do the building regulations work too complicated ?
guil@@ der : I registered my project correctly .
especially complex , it is always the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ etian &apos;s special building and the position of the slot .
fresh in the green .
it will always be underground , who creates three dwellings in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in towns missing the seat .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants rely on their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ ded : there were those who accused me to create luxury houses for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely not right .
but do not swal@@ low up the compet@@ itor to pay affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ ded : it &apos;s true : in the last five years , we had built a building boom in Germany , but luxury apartments which can hardly aff@@ ord any more .
my project has the message , also the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also who are giving away his mother or the fer@@ ment@@ ers alone .
I &apos;ll show how to build and well @-@ built today .
that is why it is .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone OS operating system when Apple updates is released
the new operating system can be challenged by clicking on &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , you can download the option to download and install Inst@@ all .
some are pushed aside after installation , since they get an error message , informed that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to handle the problem , users are recommended to wait to wait until the look@@ out is returned or try to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean to create apps for creating space - but Apple has made it more likely to do so , but Apple has made it easier to do so if you install a special tool , to delete apps and then re @-@ install once the process is finished .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charging device , so the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple Un@@ plug that the update is going on , since the telephone may turn on half way and can result in a termination of the updates .

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the border controls are also up@@ side to our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inspec@@ tions at the Hungarian border will retain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the fact that everyone who wants to create an asylum request will also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it takes clear signal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would continue to leave refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and to establish cor@@ ri@@ dors for refugees in these circumstances .
not so , for example , the Minister of Culture of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ heads Z@@ ni@@ dar in L@@ ai@@ bach did not see .
the idea of cork was &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather be the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary .
the border with Croatia is the external limit of the Schengen Area on the other hand .
as ministers stressed , Sloven@@ ians want to deliver his borders for refugees but doesn &apos;t match factories .
&quot; each EU member must conce@@ de its obligations ; otherwise , the system does not work , &quot; emphas@@ ized Gy@@ ör@@ heads Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government took ha@@ sted , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours of Tuesday to pass in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID to avoid registration .
the Croatian police over@@ threw it in the near ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , there were constantly police cars with new refugees at the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
there are mainly for Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with some 4,000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , busses from Pre@@ se@@ vo , a Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serb border , had been displac@@ ed to the Hungarian border until now , referring to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Government of Belgrade qu@@ ails , however , that it is necessary to propose people to meet certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor we want to do this . &quot;
according to the media reports a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town S@@ ID arrived in the morning , and further buses were expected to attend the day .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were the whole night of some 500 kilometres distant from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police told us that we should go down here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel between Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
this makes it actually possible to cover the fore@@ seen shift in the previous Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities to limit control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of Interior O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic pro@@ st@@ resses that his country had prepared appropriate plans for potential explo@@ iting stations for the fall of a strong state of refugees .
details he did not call , but he pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen member &apos; comprehensive possibilities to limit control . &quot;
lead to strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , and since then it has been a good reference to the country , as far as the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to be set behind the Hungarian border .
according to the reports of media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ g@@ os which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border check@@ points of Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees want to pass on to the Croatian border , still un@@ clear .
on Wednesday evening of the Serbian Minister Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic , he tried to calm difficulties in hor@@ g@@ os : he will keep the debates about the Alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would currently not be to deal with high refugee numbers .
one could not say whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers for migrants to - dangerous - Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee resi@@ dues already began to distribute maps to refugees , on which alternative country tracks are drawn through Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border there are also 20 years after the end of the end of the border , there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mini @-@ inhabitants had been sent to the border region .

therefore this life @-@ effective action to the 20 year olds would be good .
it is not under@@ stand@@ able that each on the tablets are publicly under@@ stand@@ able , however , it is under@@ stand@@ able to be a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is to be adher@@ ed to as fore@@ seen with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine lam@@ mer , have just contributed much to the hospitals in recent years that people have contributed much to the human being .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result shu@@ ff@@ ed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex dis@@ appoint@@ ments dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant sens@@ us its winner &apos;s outlook on a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his boat transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for vacation today .
at this time in the last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share dropped by 2.5 percent in pre@@ market @-@ commerce 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the fiscal year , ending 20 cents lower than in previous forecast .
anal@@ ysts expect a survey of the Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower views comes in spite of the price increases , which will be on average 4.9 percent and on January 4 and despite higher increase for bo@@ ilers of heavy and large packages that will be exalted from November .
the company told that it is expected to increase the result from the previous year due to cost reductions , higher revenue and increase their growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith states that the company expects a solid revenues , especially in manufacturing and global trade , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for the holiday employment have been announced a day later when the Ri@@ vals UPS plan , the plans to susp@@ end 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional working forces , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex served 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind US $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve from the Investment Bank Investment Research asked the anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct .
sales increased by 5 percent to CHF 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the st@@ acks were expecting an expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
over the past few years F@@ ed@@ Ex had a decline to the international preferred post@@ age order that brought sales to his unit express delivery .
but the boom in the online shopping segment has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was slightly dirty because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
Express unit recorded higher income from higher prices , while earnings decreased by higher labor costs in the cargo business .
in the pre@@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .

at their expected conference in the year @-@ Federal Reserve Strat@@ ens spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table , to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost one decade to advance the heading .
dro@@ pping over them on one end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ storey conference courses there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder of this fact that F@@ ed @-@ Chair@@ men Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ time contract from Congress : maximum employment and prices remain stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have been recognized that there is an un@@ trained third Mand@@ ate : financial stability .
and this third Mand@@ ate may be the X @-@ factor in a decision that &apos;s too close to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday that the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned out by the unprecedented inc@@ en@@ tive attraction in close @-@ zero interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is solid , the youngest tur@@ bul@@ ence could be severely severely pain@@ ed by the global financial markets that rein@@ force the interest of the interest in the federal income , and it was also just by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; apparently the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief economic in the Mak@@ ler@@ ship Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when they were searching for a pre@@ text , the increased un@@ certainty is not to wait around the global market enough to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed is going to do the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently discovered from Bloom@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets are expecting a decrease in the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase the increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists will broadcast the impact by giving a further increase far away .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average score reached 2@@ 28@@ 89 points or 1.4 % on Tuesday , compared to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 by 2@@ 28@@ 89 points .
this action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds the set up in this week , said John Lon@@ sky , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Service Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
if you do it , &quot; it would have to go very far in her statement to ass@@ ure the financial markets , so they do not fall into pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an interest income would be calm , because it would fail to eliminate the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would eliminate .
one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on a good way to raise the set by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow dis@@ appearance of monetary policy would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that despite the complaints of liber@@ als , more economic progress would be required to increase an increase of the sentence .
although the creation of work@@ places in August slow@@ down , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % over the last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level designed by F@@ ed as full employment .
wage gains have shown evidence of recovery .
and although inflation settled at the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the voltage on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ prescribed .
but the financial markets throughout the world had accumulated in the end of the month after China had enhanced its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average score was over 16 % in May by more than 16 % for investors , feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would thre@@ aten the global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , the Dow now is nearly 10 % below the target of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market tur@@ mo@@ il influence the complex lim@@ iting , when one should increase the interest .
&quot; if the events do not appear on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy in the past few weeks , they would assume that at this session , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate , and a former collabor@@ ator of the US @-@ banknote .
now he predic@@ ts that it will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty existing what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically in decision @-@ making .
but in the end effect the F@@ ed Monetary Authority is become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous throughout the last years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere note of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to confusion about the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where the markets and econom@@ ies are increasingly out@@ sour@@ ced , they can not only monitor the developments in other place but also with other central banks and experts advise you to obtain a better understanding for the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Art as Science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the Management of the Company En@@ vest@@ ment Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . &quot; notice this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements , which are linked to the economic foundation dates . &quot;
le@@ acker , voting rights of the Federal Open Market Committee , paying for an interest @-@ rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its conduc@@ t@@ ins by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , despite a lim@@ esc@@ able effect on growth in the U.S. , &quot; said L@@ acker .
one year later the F@@ ed representatives completed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability during a heavy crisis as the 2008 market calling , Adam S. Pos@@ en , a former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ bul@@ ence should not come close to that level , he said .
... &quot; I don &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she has afraid of interest @-@ interest , because the markets was afraid , &quot; said Pos@@ en , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double al@@ mond and not mention the financial stability , and until it is altered , I do not believe that she should lead the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more refugees arrive in Germany in these days .
them a warm welcome to prepare , do not work with the engagement of numerous volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a whole number of people to support the un@@ profitable asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is the teacher and soul teacher .
she still teaches with her 74 Karat .
every Thursday she has dealt with asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Road .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan , to learn the German language .
of course , the course of other lessons is as at a real school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promote nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy women about how important good food during the n@@ urs@@ ing time . you do this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on boo@@ bs , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients you need to establish a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake would not have the only di@@ ät@@ et@@ ical adaptation to do the mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet may actually prevent their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a un@@ healthy diet of the child could be negative at the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ oli@@ an sports hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he was an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ sigh@@ ted gym@@ n@@ ave at the Bern@@ ward sports grounds are step forward by step : in the recent community meeting , the extended building application was blessed without big discussions .
previously , the committee had agreed on an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respec@@ tive &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid accident plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; exception , &quot; there was a special form for a special form regarding the roof structure .
according to this , a &quot; arti@@ c roof with non @-@ mit@@ able first and roof top should be built . &quot;
background of planning is the scheduled use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; by this way we get a wonder@@ fully large South @-@ dd@@ ach , &quot; explained by Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
with the &quot; Liberation , &quot; in turn , once again , the roof pitch prop@@ elled for an energet@@ ic reasons - unlike in the development plan - below 10 degrees .
the volume of the hall is therefore significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan not to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was de@@ pressed by the simil@@ ar@@ ation of the municipality in the manner by the Liberation of Liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; that St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym building at the Sports Centre is a community project for the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros have been calculated .
sub@@ sid@@ y will be expected by the school and braking transport .
in the next process of proce@@ eding the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is to be submitted to the Parliament together with the audit .
hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital shall be closed as planned as planned in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital at the same time .
the station and the majority of associates move by P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
that will see the surprising simil@@ ar@@ ities of the hospital GmbH of the District Court , the Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White confirmed .
however , a decision on the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will take place next Wednesday , 23 September .
plans to be realized , then all of the nearly 50 employees would take on the hospital at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority of men should move with f@@ ishers and the existing inside to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the employees who can not be with Sch@@ ong@@ au , are to be offered at a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , so Y@@ och@@ rome @-@ White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
triggered the change from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who only has been a member of the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic , and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
the question : according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; came into being ready , came to take on the line as of October 1st and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of October 1 .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is considered an &quot; recovery &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for heart pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the interior center on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
crossing the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board is entitled to return to both houses , until then the former hospital of the app@@ artment , which still has more than 35 beds , will be finally closed at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the County decided this planned for 2018 if the currently ongoing renovation at the hospital of W@@ eil@@ heim .
Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , did rum@@ ors that the house that is located in possession of the Federal Republic of Germany is to be used as an accommodation for asylum @-@ officers .
&quot; that I close . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner &apos;s white could not say that there are several consider@@ ations .
at the moment there are a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and a tag@@ onal sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could happen to us , such an opportunity doesn &apos;t happen again , &quot; as f@@ ishers go well over the Qu@@ ery to the Le@@ ch , who had been positi@@ vely surprised by the employees &quot; and has been compreh@@ en@@ sible . &quot;
a real perspective for the house where a fisher@@ man works for over 30 years as principal doctor has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to assume the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was shot in the last decades . departments were closed , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics .

hunting case with two last at Pr@@ at@@ au
two traction drivers have been hurt during their ma@@ ize harvest on the morning afternoon by che@@ ers .
during the super@@ st@@ ating on a ma@@ ize field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were used as the police hur@@ ried .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate &quot; victims of violence
as a susp@@ ect , the police have led the police on the strip of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the au@@ dit@@ r , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was killed , the yo@@ ungst@@ ers murdered and their bodies have been thrown into a rock in rock breaks .
one of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate is married to a violent victim .
the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern as public prosecutor and police arrested on Wednesday evening .
as a number of people , another 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested , who indeed led the indication and investig@@ ators had taken the place of the dead body .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning , after they had come at home on the eve after visiting a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators were waiting on personal items of the O@@ pf@@ ner .
after un@@ question@@ ing in the circle and known circle of the missing person , there is finally a suspic@@ ion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged off@@ ender introduced the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the dead was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old police officer and the dead bodies were put into the canal .
on Wednesday , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be introduced at the Haf@@ tri@@ fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ator had the burden to him .
during the immediate vicinity of the fact , the other investigations are supposed to begin .
refugees need guest : study bor@@ ns of H@@ ousing
the situation on the German housing market is ke@@ en .
even more refugees seek an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social r@@ att@@ ing stands before a challenge .
the distribution rules on the German housing market have recently been started .
with the upcoming refugees and working seek@@ ers from the EU , more people push their toll on a market , which is now over@@ loaded into many large cities .
they compete with welcome citizens around the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for paid apartments , 400,000 new units will have to be built by 2020 .
the result is a study on behalf of the association &quot; Social Resi@@ dential Development . &quot;
by comparison : this year 26@@ 0,000 units will be finished in Germany .
that means that 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay there are no longer required to live asylum seek@@ ers in an educational accommodation .
many encounter across the apartment market and rows in the long front of the rent apartments .
according to Statist@@ ical Office the last year there were less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not just over the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant impair@@ ments in housing policy of the last years .
Germany ten@@ ces a housing estate that will become a year larger from year to year .
at present , Matthias Günther , author of the study , are already missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas .
many working stayed therefore in large cities in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed last because of the sl@@ ack@@ ening of the apartment market no longer in the &quot; Hotel MO@@ M . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square metres per capita has been reduced for the first time in the past few years .
in order to solve the problem the Alliance &quot; Social Mak@@ ing &quot; strikes a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ en@@ tives to stim@@ ulate the social housing developments again .
for this , the tax @-@ government tax may be ren@@ ounced and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed flats will be suspended .
in addition to the Alliance , attractive tax @-@ tax opportunities will be necessary .
the promotion programme for refugee centres of the state bank Kf@@ W come now well in cities and municipalities already well .
a good week after the start was at the Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available potential of some 300 million Euros .
now the project could even be raised .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are considered corridor
there is virtually no way to Hungary . since then , more refugees select the way about Croatia .
Zagreb begins to grant the trip over Slovenia into the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
dangerous is the route but still .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring state of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ ri@@ dors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slovenian inner Minister , and if it &apos;s necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the mar@@ sh@@ ading of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees broke out to Croatia in order to reach Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV broad@@ caster RTL .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the previous day .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , extra@@ ordin@@ arily super@@ flu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to reach something .
but there are people who not to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police arrested the first refugees on the Serbian border between Serbia and the EU neighbouring country on the morning .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came in both with the bus and taxi into the village of S@@ ID .
immediately after their arrival , they had attempted to walk through the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serb border , the refugees shou@@ ldn &apos;t reach mar@@ sh .
this is the bound@@ aries of different d@@ angers : there are still sharp mines left from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
the dre@@ amer is now supposed to create a safe passage .
according to Hungary , close to the closure of the border there is no more refugees .
on Tuesday the police numbered 366 .
shortly before door opening on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws repe@@ ating the over@@ coming and damage of the limit as criminal off@@ ence .
a total of 35 procedure was started in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted are pen@@ alties for 5 years and the deportation of the country .
according to the immig@@ ration authority , we have taken a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers on Tuesday , all of which have taken in total 94 asylum seek@@ ers , almost all - 93 - at the most important junction R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with young children and two older people are .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
however , no one has no chance to get granted asylum in Hungary .
Serbia has a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers have to be turned out there .
before the &quot; trans@@ lu@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to break up .
they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish , leaving the tens of thousands of people over the past few weeks .
Pl@@ ywood were dismant@@ led and one of the entered into the border was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself toward the goal of this reconstruction .
Austria reach only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
in addition , the country has strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still working on the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the order of German authorities in the morning .
in 2004 , smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor of &quot; Y@@ ud@@ ge &quot; passed over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy upon the bridge on Sunday with the dream when ten people with travel agents at the entrance of Zel@@ otes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; named mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had sur@@ pris@@ ingly trained for refugee transport with Austria on Sunday , it was the Stad@@ ler &apos;s level for them in Wer@@ n@@ stein , the Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his aid and drove along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the near Pass@@ au .
prior to the first time , we only em@@ bra@@ i@@ ded our guests , with snack and drink .
we said equal , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course it was of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said city bab@@ es in the O@@ Ö@@ N talk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man would not take it to hand a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stran@@ ded we@@ be@@ ers were increased on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE train in a regional train direction Pass@@ au , in order to reach Germany after the short notice that the rail traffic was stopped after Germany , yet to try the fron@@ tier on the border .
the regional train was transferred to the Inn in Wer@@ n@@ stein on the Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein , the border @-@ border ral is generally higher in the course .
the bridge firmly connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , a day before a two bridge @-@ run sporty - organized by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the Viktor Or@@ b@@ án send us ten thousands of thousands of us while Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is a logical result of seem@@ ingly holy politics :
rather than in the storage of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately during the creation of structures , our German ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or has officially , and publicly held the attitude of the Hungarian government to the dun@@ geon of the National Soci@@ alism .
bodies of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are con@@ fron@@ ted in the bound@@ aries of cha@@ otic states now .
also the pl@@ ough@@ ed people will notice that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; which she had invited and welcomed , nothing as a further refugee camp .
there will be a major challenge in view of the continuing refugee currents and the near wind , to us the worthy of in@@ tri@@ cent conditions for protective seek@@ ers .
and it will be still greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winter @-@ hard quartz
Konrad hasn &apos;t put his hands full with the refugee &apos;s refugee .
Christian Konrad is it used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ kers to set quot@@ as for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the First Center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already received the grip on delivery .
&quot; we haven &apos;t reported homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported his first success .
the &quot; 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , will be without great confusion , &quot; Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master output . &quot;
by contrast , the Interior Ministry asked by a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
Konrad Adenauer has a total demand for 85@@ ,000 Distri@@ cts a year .
in order to fulfil the number , 35,000 accommodations will have to be found in the next weeks - 20.000 are to provide the country , 15,000 of the federal states .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the administrative barri@@ ers , he has already been convers@@ ations .
they had assured him , even for the coming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria he runs well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ala assi@@ sts Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christophe Schön@@ born , to be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
even expectations of the asylum coordinator in the ORF @-@ Campa@@ ign is &quot; hel@@ per &quot; as we . &quot;
private individuals can offer un@@ complicated Accommodations on the platform .
in addition , it is hop@@ ing for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot;
in emergency times it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must have a certain height of the towel @-@ holder or mag .
for a term time we would have to apply &quot; Emer@@ gency standards . &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , Konrad and his experience was justified with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older lord , who doesn &apos;t say without further into the face of truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ ader will be his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic to produce no costs as they declared themselves .
they want to increase its head@@ count on three to four .
the own source search was previously not successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz in office .
nevertheless there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls a better division
there is no opening of urban sp@@ ic@@ kers and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees planning for the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is currently not necessary as they can accept the affected apart from these measures , says mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for an emergency , further locations should be tested for their tra@@ di@@ bility .
criticism of the municipal authority responsible for the spl@@ itting of refugees in the federal state .
other districts have to be made here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; the borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer period with the Bavarian prime minister , Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the Bavarian prime minister , Josef Pen@@ it@@ inger ( VP ) has been post@@ pon@@ ed another existence in the refugee camp on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has as@@ sures me that the German borders can not be sealed .
the travel of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , this is to give the bound@@ ary control .
special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer give there any more .
however , the seek@@ ers would have brought regular trains to Germany .
by the other EU member states , P@@ ie@@ inger called for more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question .
that also Austria lead to its borders again , is for ag@@ it@@ inger &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the anticip@@ ation of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the Administrator @-@ General of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the German industrial line is officially completed .
four out of six floors of the office and production building is the stock company IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is intended to be hired to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the IT , the clever people are our raw material and we have to try to work for us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could introduce to invest in start@@ up companies of the New Ship@@ yard , and later also to search out what is to be acquired .
from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to co@@ operate with the new neigh@@ bors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises further : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a question of time . &quot;
in total , 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is influenced by the Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
there are already 30 percent of the 2700 square meters resi@@ ding surface in the building are already rented , for an additional 40 percent there is in@@ quiries .

the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
it has been rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think that I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , amongst others , that also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own site where only her hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only man in the grandfather of Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who himself has Italian roots .
fashion interest has been given by her mother in the cra@@ dle .

why so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in a trance , may well answer the house@@ wife with last security .
maybe it is about to run a beautiful bag of every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancest@@ or by Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also combines a man with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to be US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for exc@@ itement .
whether he has expressed himself strange ac@@ coun@@ ties , journalists we@@ des or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential election initiated the election campaign vig@@ or@@ ously .
and cuts well .
this is also registered in the Palat@@ inate c@@ all@@ ine , where the grand@@ parents of the estate billi@@ ards .
the New York with the conc@@ up@@ is@@ ur is a term to many of the Win@@ zer@@ a at the Wein@@ straße .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants live is about -@@ nin@@ ety with it is related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers then think about his goal , the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I believe that somehow gets the somehow exciting , but in her city &apos;s neither so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spro@@ uts , too , besides Tr@@ ump , also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for conf@@ ection , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also in word - with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king in his heart .
although there is respect to the power of the family , but also ten@@ ci@@ ally the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; would be a bit of a big Mo@@ or@@ ish , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; acci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ump comes from the village of An@@ ders .
the ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather was emigrated , and in the USA a local wine for gold mines opened .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the property company in New York were corn@@ erst@@ one .
but life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their wish to return to the home , the Bavarian state , at that time , belonged to the Bavarian State , at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once approved without permission , the Director of the institute for b@@ ular history and folk tun@@ es , Roland Paul , was announced to film release .
he was the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is shown by contrast to the mit@@ re statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly spoke about Mexican immig@@ rants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border dam to det@@ ain illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; as the pol@@ arity , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a removable Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , who was born in Op@@ a , his native Heinz &apos; ) .
the win@@ emaker generally see the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so rough . &quot;

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will choose ?
revealed secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have apparently died , who wins the Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor .
the woman , when the Sam Wood in The Bachelor was finally fin@@ ed in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was in greatest secret keeping .
neither shall none of the three left girls will not give up , whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you probably won an indication to those who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips @-@ resistant to the final on Thursday
all three women have left themselves in ly@@ rical ways , why Wood is the perfect man and nour@@ ished his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get the ancient Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could save answers to your player , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ sor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
jewel@@ s @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki saw both their quickly - apart from itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment that when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ai ) and Sam@@ s , I noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that they were quite compatible in the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is on the earth with two feet , making it a lot of fun with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleas@@ antly and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she would be well suited for a pair of Sam Wood as a pair .
from her perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visiting visit last week did it clear that wood will be &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw him with my friends and my family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am un@@ locked on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when asked , her wood should choose , if it was not , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast@@ ed on Sunday , 19 : 30 on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his re@@ location to the USA , and there were many other teams who sent to send back the previous year &apos;s impressive training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ as@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some co@@ aches would have been banned for the rest of the game to the Bank as he lost a message , as it was the Aus@@ sie Rug@@ by League bank@@ rupt@@ cies on Tuesday with his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday of 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ islav confi@@ ded to his husband and gave her next opportunity to a p@@ unt @-@ return and also into the running game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ as@@ ula still showed his true face in the dressing unit after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ns publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey to forget his pat@@ ted catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is patented in a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota Vik@@ ings
there was certainly not the start to Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian sales support for his NF@@ L debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field and talked about the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not even imagine a worse start into his NF@@ L career ,
&quot; that was a thing that happen now , it &apos;s only about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne compar@@ es the Schn@@ itzer with his Origin in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

for easy @-@ overweight diabet@@ ics can be helpful without loss of weight loss .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily @-@ overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say that easily @-@ overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery is longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial part of the new study in J@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss treatment or o@@ bes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to record food .
over the years , o@@ bes@@ ity operations have proved the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were carried out in people who are disease @-@ ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital survey which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of o@@ bes@@ ity - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI among those who underwent surgery in this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
of this , the BMI with those who did not surgical treatment treatments were approximately equal to 29 .
of those who subjected to an surgical procedure , 36 % of the type of diabetes , disin@@ teg@@ rated at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is only dissolved in the comparison with diabetes in just one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results were tested during the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; in general in the &quot; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also watch the patients &apos; blood mirror of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood gl@@ ucose levels over time .
Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held at 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , remained stable at approximately 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - how you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , so the role of researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also provides average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , increased back inputs in BMI ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and had a more complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden , that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in ob@@ ese people treated with ob@@ o@@ bes@@ ity surgery , accounting for about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group of conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery , Black@@ stone said that it is soo@@ thing for people having a BMI of 35 who are interested in the proceedings .
&quot; that is the critical point of this study because they say that this operation is lower in this particular BMI group , &quot; without an elevated risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors do begin to take weight as soon as the patient lies with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait for long , until we bring people to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that as soon as they have collected these genetic changes , they have linked their bodies with o@@ bes@@ ity and diabetes , is a recur@@ ring . &quot;
love story Play in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is a theme that is currently in the fiction of fiction : a young woman , too popular and un@@ expect@@ edly , after years she returns to the flock of their youth and this is in love with them .
and so in the recent novel , we are not so called &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ af@@ e readers , because he plays in long @-@ we@@ iler and the surrounding settlements .
the main professional author was growing up in Long@@ we@@ iler and is pleased that she was able to put a literary monument in her native town .
&quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not record all refugees , the Dalai Lama said , added that the real solution in the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist guide ur@@ ged to termin@@ ate violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed on the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of West European countries on the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama declared Germany &apos;s struggle against the crisis in Germany , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime , you must think about long term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing in their countries is decreased .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never resolved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence , and commented on George Bus@@ h@@ s actions after the terrorist bombing of September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the USA moved a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after 11 September , I explained my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him , the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , His mot@@ ives were good , but he set violence an unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase by taking @-@ disinfection products by children in the past 4 years
g@@ aging centers in the US reports over a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ low greatly alcoholic fermentation inf@@ lows , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the inst@@ ances of revenue in children under the age of 12 , reported po@@ ison control centers , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly being used for these products and unfortunately , a percentage of them go to the emergency list , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children can be inten@@ tionally drunk while some are doing their friends to im@@ press her friends or for a mut@@ ation in the social media .
show videos on YouTube , such as yo@@ ungst@@ ers drink only because of a budget experience .
te@@ ens supp@@ os@@ edly mixed disinfect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ containing oral water to get a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be sc@@ aled by attractive D@@ ents of disinfect@@ ant .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand disinfect@@ ant ) are those who are well rewarded .
there are disinfect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ ang@@ kas that are very attractive for children .
wall @-@ disinfection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
even few spl@@ ashes of alcohol can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; telling Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ call centre at the University of Kansas , the Sender Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p key , but people let these hand disinfect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had taken four spl@@ ashes of driving for earthquake disinfection products in school , was taken into a emergency recovery .
her blood @-@ alcohol level was 179 , twice higher than the threshold being dr@@ unken with an adult , Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said , a doctor of emergency , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah caught my words and wasn &apos;t able to go to the position when she arrived in the Emer@@ gency Corps .
physicians monitored them over night in a separate children hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had joined the head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very fear@@ ing , &quot; says Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ amin &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it would have been foolish to my child .
L@@ op@@ ez managed to use parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinfection systems outside the child &apos;s range .
about alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation there were some disinfect@@ ants associated with death cases .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died of tobacco products , which contained a toxic , non @-@ clear ingredient .
health professionals assume that the product me@@ thanol contained a dead@@ ly solution instead of ethylene alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class were held in New York State , her &quot; Teacher &apos; po@@ is@@ oned by anti@@ bacterial products in around the class@@ room , then reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to wear @-@ disinfection products and utterly destroyed them in their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked the failed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and inter@@ disciplinary action against the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
during a dri@@ pping on the cross p@@ liers between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and on Her@@ on , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver has been slightly injured .
a 60 year old truck driver drove on the trans@@ verse direction towards the industrial area and took too late that at the roundabout two left cars had stopped .
in the wake , he pr@@ un@@ ed with his lor@@ ry to the stern of an Audi@@ s , and to see this vehicle for a before filed Ford Fi@@ esta .

rum@@ ours report by Cel@@ tic Glasgow , which was withdrawn from Griff@@ i@@ ths spontan@@ e@@ ously . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under pressure control , as they prepare for the con@@ front@@ ation with the Dutch championship leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football @-@ bo@@ red inf@@ am@@ ers - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger team of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , since there is no title gi@@ bility with the ran@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic Games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ ger is not there .
people don &apos;t talk about the return of the ran@@ ger .
they speak of the Old Fir@@ m .
they together talk about both teams and that is what they were interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games and there are not only the people who want to see this games .
I will turn the things swe@@ ars by D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian chief s@@ ware to turn the things .
following the defeat against Malmö and the following departure from the Champions League the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen , which now clearly showed a convincing lead on the top of the table , with five points of lead .
D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; Cel@@ tic had already bad times , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened .
we feel that just so - but we must go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic , because that makes the player better .
now it is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January @-@ transfer
despite his comments , just a few weeks ago that he pointed out that he ha@@ sted a number of January transfers , Leader@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is c@@ auti@@ ous with the signature of re@@ adily and insi@@ sts that he wants to inter@@ rupt the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come in summer have this pre @-@ season period to integrate with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more power were caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Derby , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the stor@@ ms and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s sure I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ ne@@ bin who plays not for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Der@@ ek Mc@@ In@@ nes is a dream that his team had to fight in Aberdeen action against Hamilton Ac@@ tari@@ al to see a seventh consecutive league win , which brought them a lead out of five points before Cel@@ tic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey@@ s El@@ f@@ m in the first half of season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ nes said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no team who has won all , in poker games or li@@ ken@@ ess , the games of this kind won &apos;t won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it grows in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period rose by 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.9 percent above the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the local statistic for the National Statistics ( ONS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 per cent .
the state Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest numbers and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historical choice to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we experienced another improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .
r@@ unk@@ y distur@@ bing the course
as the security personnel could not meet the situation , the employees called the police .

why I will be a witness to O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma at the execution
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man becomes to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a viewer &apos;s gallery in the chamber of the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is executed by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was already mentioned for the first time in January about his best friend and although I was sho@@ cked , I voted .
when the day was closer , I began to fear me .
so , why should I do it ?
I voted because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
a unique perspective would offer .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since often more applications are available as seats , you will find a ma@@ ke@@ en lot@@ tery to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who is selected , who will watch it emotional .
I cannot do it .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ s@@ ps next boy@@ friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone numbers and a 2 and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh lou@@ der than we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to draw what I see .
I just have to try to remind me of all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , accused me of Twitter , giving me to my im@@ part@@ ment .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of the in@@ mates how he wants it , and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained about me .
she dre@@ amed that she could have &quot; better form@@ ulate &quot; but they still remember that it &apos;s wrong that I do .
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can easily remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to present an international re@@ porter , in order to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that public relation of movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of po@@ d@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back here for details .
I cannot say with security that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would seek him to be a bene@@ fic@@ i@@ ent of fact .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is no sufficient evidence , in order to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from that perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be obj@@ ec@@ tively speaking .
there will be other re@@ porter , for which you can turn out .
what you &apos;ll get of me , what it is said to see a man of unnecessary death .
man after hum@@ id police @-@ pursu@@ ing talks , coming from the C@@ anning River to come
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he survived the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Perth , to the police , was un@@ successful when he found himself in the conf@@ ession and sum@@ p@@ ent waters , just a few metres from a police officer , who tried to withdraw it gently to return to the shore .
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house@@ keeping case in pel@@ ham last Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he was not too far .
&quot; he stood in water , and said &apos; I &apos;m not out , come and get me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Const@@ able Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about it to make its uniform . therefore he turned a more reliable tac@@ tics - &quot; A good dar@@ ker is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people are funny things to try to try , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to split it and threat@@ ens to finish the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards from Racing Victoria tries to install a sp@@ y in the last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he zi@@ pped to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on a racing day treatment , the last stro@@ kes on Wednesday , through .
Moo@@ dy , Fair@@ fax media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself found even under difficult conditions when it went to explain the positive co@@ b@@ alt @-@ role rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he could not explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ y alleg@@ ations and didn &apos;t want to see that it &quot; out how high gra@@ ff@@ icking grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say nothing about it , and sometimes I have healthy eating , but sometimes you are fru@@ str@@ ated that everything goes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know that there was far@@ ther .
sometimes you react , and one must live with the consequences , and I must live by what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to go round , and I want to think that my owner will try my best to try them .
if you start to think , I do not do that , then I should be more trainer .
I then need to consider what I do with my license .
before Moo@@ dy had led the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , convinced that the integrity department had attempted to write down his barn .
&quot; prior to eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart , sat in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables in order to provide information about what I would do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they believe obvious that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , surely , they should surely put their n@@ oses , because they have an attempt to deal with me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the Route L , David Moo@@ dy , President of the RUF and Bernard Sa@@ ab@@ dry , the current CEO of Route L , were consci@@ ously aware of the time , and are still today .
should this be aware that it becomes personally ?
has the RUF lead ahead and makes people responsible for doing what is going on in the industry ?
am I badly for the sector ?
am I so bad for the sector ?
perhaps people think outside that I am there .
perhaps they have to take my license and cast me off , and I have no doubt that this is what I say they are now thinking about it .
but I have arrived at the point where no matter is , and that &apos;s g@@ rie@@ ve me .
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert the pressure on them and pass them out to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the train@@ ers of train@@ ers have established itself with the long @-@ term co@@ b@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching held that he could mark &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the simple master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , awarded the race @-@ treatment rule usually &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of mud or tone was applied to the horse on the horse &apos;s rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
I have to take over responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my employees had er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied to the ban .
it would have been so night .
yesterday , it could be so that the whole day could be so .
but it was the race day .
Moo@@ dy could con@@ fron@@ ted a pre @-@ date pre @-@ qualification for treatment with the pack on racing day . an investigation of this issue has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see one that we need rules but here is too far away , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer - Bell@@ amy beat the ri@@ val@@ ents back to ring@@ es due to alleg@@ ations
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy took criticism of the Tac@@ kling G@@ ace as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League Favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson told that the arbit@@ rator of the Storm @-@ player &quot; ring combat &quot; will compete with his team during the high @-@ rise in Sydney in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane The Bronze coach Wayne Bennett made a little h@@ ack@@ ed note with the Storm team , after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ ere on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League , saying that the two from Queens@@ land could not be &quot; good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defend the pits in his team and said that they were only focused on her &quot; Contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kling G@@ mb@@ h .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading coach in his team agree that it is evident that they should wor@@ ried away from the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it appears again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ ve when she &apos;s defeated 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed every year in our defensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made contact our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus and that made us the trend turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny as it appears anytime again at this season .
Bell@@ net@@ ts used the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and inspired his ment@@ or to remember that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; long @-@ lift &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of thr@@ illing football .
he moved his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember in 2010 St George as a bo@@ red team critic@@ ised , and Wayne said that he will take care of a di@@ vor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and watch it as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so they can play as they play .
I build strengthened trust , because they say these things , because they &apos;re a little concerned to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t have thought about us when it went to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs Roo@@ sters includes a higher result than the game Bron@@ co to play against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good play , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that exciting game ?
or are breaks and don &apos;t have a anything like rat@@ ering ?
for me it is the ti@@ met@@ ables .
if they mention us , it means that we will come to meet at one phase .
the Storm team is free to receive this weekend , as they have won the right , either North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boy or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start at the next morning @-@ morning service .
en@@ quiry with $ 200,000 Deposit to Drug an@@ kl@@ age
a man , possibly , threat@@ ens a life sentence due to his trial , to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were h@@ ug@@ ed to Queens@@ land , was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested in the last month after the police raid on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which arrived from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he took his co @-@ def@@ endants in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life sentence for the attempt to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argu@@ ing that it was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount , and that in the Café guests could have been a harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter flange , was wor@@ ried about the risk of sail@@ or with Mac@@ mo@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the Court on Wednesday .
in the case of the criminal case , he is lied to the police about his position .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ad &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security offered to achieve its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the des@@ per@@ tory explanation of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Justice P@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be sufficient to do it out of it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against a security deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian pass , if the police reports on a daily basis from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used monitoring of girls to attract disc@@ oph@@ ile data to send pictures
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images from childhood abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl as this as@@ le@@ ep , log@@ ged in an online messenger service , from which he received a number of un@@ employed images of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping de@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished her mother immediately .
the police tro@@ dden down and saw the five images , then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; concerned &quot; web research , the terms for searching for in@@ constant pictures of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g alleged to the civil servants that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a polic@@ eman has to be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

towing network to small border crossing across Germany
more and more refugees are led out of major control points along the German @-@ Austrian border .
many emig@@ rants choose fear of discovery and arrest the people increases to smaller border points
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the district flow Inn , more than 1,000 refugees were picked up in the districts of Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and tubes to the German side .
during reception they are taken and forwarded by the Federal Police in receiving and re@@ directed to registration .
the police station met once again on Wednesday at the Munich central station on Wednesday that again considerably more refugees .

Stuttgart : f@@ ooth@@ ills of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the South@@ west is expected
meteor@@ ologist war@@ es in front of pl@@ ung@@ es in the South@@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
warm sea air flows through Western Europe has moved to the country because of a low pressure @-@ beyond Europe ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the strongest part of the &quot; Henry &quot; tropical storm , &quot; was the Atlantic Ocean between the Bermuda Islands and the Atlantic in the past few days .
violent stor@@ ms and thunder@@ stor@@ ms are expected especially in Baden .
according to the D@@ WD , till Thursday also in the Black Forest in the Black Forest , at the Schw@@ ä@@ b@@ ische Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ seek@@ re@@ is with ar@@ ches of 60 @-@ 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun can look back for longer .
the mass makes it : every two years , the motor@@ homes show its innovations at the IAA .
2015 is most import@@ antly during the compact car , which is currently being used particularly well .
cars from the compact class are currently being question@@ ed : around 28@@ .1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the Swiss Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is reflected at the Frankfurt Motor Show ( audience days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the largest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in the autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the Messe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the nu@@ cle@@ us of the brand .
the new Astra should also be sold as well , so the new Astra is not much more expensive .
Opel launches a entry level below the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf in Vista , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will be priced at Euro 16 990 .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
the H@@ esse also offer more diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important compet@@ itor VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra only offered five five @-@ ton models at first .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which also has to be seen at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
and what about the Astra at the IAA is still the new compact car ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra compet@@ itor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
the Mé@@ gan@@ e Mé@@ gan@@ e exclusively appears as a five @-@ door in a conventional and spor@@ tive sporty GT version .
he comes to trade in the beginning of next year , then as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
this compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines is fully compatible with the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
on offer , however , a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp are also available .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
depending on the manufacturer , the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres ( Nm ) .
sales start of the village of Bal@@ eno in Europe in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but all around is the compact class assem@@ od@@ ell DS 4 which is visible at the IAA .
outside , the designer of the noble Citroën @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers provided all hand on the front part : the radiator gr@@ ille was redesigned and equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , especially the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and are integrated within the first Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
at the IAA in the compact class , the compact car in the compact class was added to a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the infl@@ ated Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres cell is in@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee for a cat@@ ch@@ ment area Te@@ gel right , which was accommodated in mon@@ el@@ ang in a small cell .
because of the injury of their lives , prisoners are generally eligible for financial compensation when they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision therefore decided on the German Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the affected may even be hop@@ ed for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the close ties ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe , where he was accommodated in a single cell with around five square meters floor area between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was not separated .
after that , the man , who has now gone into a larger cell after the information of his coat , has now been moved to a larger cell .
his duties of liability for the ir@@ rever@@ ence of criminal liability against the Land Berlin has failed .
however , the Constitutional Court opened the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Berlin and rejected the case of the renewed examination .
they see the human dig@@ nity of man .
Chamber Court now decided to pay the amount of compensation
even if for jur@@ idi@@ cal reasons , only a few days of detention had to be decisive for compensation , it was the same for the compensation .
otherwise it would be &quot; a conc@@ earning of the legal protection of personality . &quot;
the Chamber Court must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the constitutional rights have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they only said in April to an in@@ mate of damages , because he was imprisoned in a cell naked in one cell .
human st@@ worthy is according to a 2011 decision that also the multi@@ ples of one cell is without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , furthermore , on Wednesday , the Berlin &apos;s Court of Constitutional Court confirmed a in@@ cent accommodation in a parallel operation in a parallel operation in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff took place on three months each day between 15 and 21 hours , like that of the same cell as in the Kar@@ ls .
in recent weeks the Berlin pris@@ ons were also lacking in head@@ lines during the last weeks .
det@@ ain@@ ees will therefore be included 23 hours , but by themselves , it is said to kill themselves because of the cl@@ amped parts .
according to the alignment of the judicial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young talent , 19 are expected to go away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immig@@ ration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Justice in this year , with the statement from Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) and is capable of holding a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrates how to demonstrate the unusual challenge : &quot; I say back again and again : we can do this , and we do it . &quot;
what comes to Germany convey@@ s the following overview .
it is used by different forecasts from 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments every year - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space but especially with affordable accommodation rental : annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments come out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments , even refugees apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding , from a total of 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that of the pest@@ il@@ ence institute : 80 000 social apartments have to be built annually , and this would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per ann@@ um .
scientists and Federal Minister of Culture agree that there will also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
according to the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the cultivated in Germany can be employed in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany would not ask for their quali@@ fications to help them with their qualification , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
but for the integration of refugees , however , they are decisive in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the estim@@ ation in the admission application , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of the immig@@ rants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ issu@@ ance , there has been a political turn@@ out : the ban of Labour for refugees in recognition of work .
while earlier a work for@@ b@@ ade for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ ces , the asylum seek@@ ers to a residential subur@@ b .
in society - also because of the specialist of professionals , it is also possible to develop the visual evidence that refugees should be quick @-@ access to the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German knowledge .
so far , there is no issue of offer to general and professional @-@ related language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most common through personal contacts .
the structure of the networks will therefore drive the right to view from Thr@@ issu@@ hardt to the ai@@ re@@ integration process .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only few fled parents gave their children in the Kit@@ ts , approximately ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root family , it is only important to meet the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s Senate department .
however , in order to convince the family of the advantages of K@@ ita they were distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators heavily increase by the large numbers of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - by adding more specialised schools .
students without German language skills are prepared on classes in the countries .
however , they are not always taught by trained teachers and teachers , as well as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as second language .
in them there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ eins from the Berlin School Administration .
the German student union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
princip@@ ally , no federal state of asylum seek@@ ers or recru@@ itment be taught - the only exception was to be Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its attitude .
study consent may be facilit@@ ated access to the university &apos;s education .
for refugees with a so@@ jour@@ n or Dul@@ ce , no achievements have been given for asylum in accordance with the asylum seek@@ ers Act more if they start their studies .
the latter is not getting a be@@ af@@ e because they don &apos;t fall under the number of the interested persons .
Ged@@ ser indic@@ ative refugees have been to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1st January 2016 to 15 months .
this financing gap has to be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will in future play a key role in future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many is the religion important component of its identity .
the state should gradually auth@@ ori@@ ze the same rights as they have the churches , and to develop the existing state @-@ churches on a new state @-@ religi@@ ons @-@ law .
also important would also be the establishment of a Islamic welfare association which car@@ es professional to the new@@ com@@ ers .
duties are also duties to the rights .
thus , the representatives of Islam have to be careful and willing to agree with the state in many areas and to grant control options .
this also belongs to the read@@ iness to take action against religious fundam@@ ent@@ alism .
the chairman of the Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed on Thursday the worry , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany too .
those who wanted to au@@ pen@@ se such conflicts in Germany immediately got their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he suggested to transl@@ ate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will be much more than today a theme throughout society today .
the majority society may also change the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - since a close decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general equilibrium principle .
but it is getting very slow as the NSU @-@ series showed that police and authorities were systematically igno@@ red in the police and authorities .
same opportunities for all : what mig@@ rating organisations and stak@@ eholder groups of non @-@ white German already require long and why international agreements are to become reality in the coming years , if the country remain peaceful and its new citizens are supposed to benefit from their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally , Germany was able to care for medical care until so far , the medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning Man@@ or Power and Capacities , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the day mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however first money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery may be used immediately upon registration of health precau@@ tions .
performance could be anticipated later by the federal states .
and at long term , it is highly frag@@ ile , so many people were exp@@ elled with the limited performance catalog , which will see the asylum seek@@ er law .
otherwise , doctors doing primarily the language barri@@ ers to create .
so far , the science of health care The@@ a Bor@@ ders has proven that migrants are worse than their in@@ firm@@ ities than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in physician offices have to become an interpre@@ ting expense , asking them .
many refugees have been helped with more gener@@ alized medical centers in emergency @-@ ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among the refugee children , there is much more untreated , and with the young people it travels to HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
with the other cases of disease , the German doctors headed by their training , Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes .
&quot; paras@@ ite @-@ fall or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to see . &quot; and , as for the state of the state , the refugees bl@@ ur@@ red even alle@@ vi@@ ations in sight .
the Syrians became a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to ut@@ ili@@ ze the qualification , they would have to prove its qualification and if possible .
at least half of the refugees in Germany are according to estimates by the Federal psycho@@ therap@@ ies ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) psych@@ ically ill : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic strain or de@@ pres@@ sions .
for this particular infr@@ in@@ gement of the refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z says , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study of the Technical University of Munich proved that every fifth Syrian refugee family had trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
who is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among others in so @-@ called flash@@ back with respir@@ atory , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ac disease and death cases .
other symptoms are dor@@ man@@ - and concentr@@ ating distur@@ b@@ ance , severe fear and emotional di@@ bility .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , premature ejaculation would be necessary , declared Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have had a psycho@@ therapy .
psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide a motion for a psycho@@ therapy , yet the treatment usually lasts several months .
in addition , there would be mostly facts or doctors that are not trained to mental illness , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to false ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dreams
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the cir@@ cus pro@@ gresses back to the traditions of the cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to draw any age group in the B@@ ann of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , veter@@ ans and in@@ hal@@ ide entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus pro@@ bst die in the arena on the brick @-@ was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine to live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior woman .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto the current production is located .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been among the hands of the family .
so the gift to the in@@ spire is thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important to get those people from their everyday life and take it to take it for two hours in a completely different world , &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Junior Suite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cocktail with world city fl@@ air , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst named his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with 50 towns on the nearly 3 000 km long tour this fl@@ air can now experience .
the Cir@@ cus program features talented artists from all over the world .
awarded the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ ok@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family , draws the audience with w@@ it and charm .
the Cast@@ illo Brothers also understand their handic@@ raft .
the Cub@@ an duo wants to loose the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and mobility - identify themselves with these words .
their hum@@ orous art in the mast should capture sk@@ et@@ ches in the storm .
the ac@@ rob@@ atic of the Cir@@ cus is also fascin@@ ated by the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus pro@@ bst and ar@@ tic@@ ulation .
to bal@@ ancing the balance on a sphere ?
for He Yuan no problem .
sl@@ oth , fascin@@ ate and shake at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like a little while fascin@@ ated by its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every aspect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ izes Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ uses in circulation of circulation are only too often subject to various animal protection organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also keeps growing : &quot; if it is not good enough for us , we are also good . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents are enjoying every string unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &apos; , as they are lov@@ ingly called , will be read from the eyes required every request .
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
does the animal feel well , it will not be in the Man@@ ege settings .
so the top commandment thus : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mix of a cr@@ un@@ landing gear and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a survey and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo wasn &apos;t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the zeb@@ ro@@ id isn &apos;t ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus pro@@ bst .
thus there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one is sure , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter whether five or 1 200 , we always give our best and are with their whole heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites every day between 17 and 20 September daily at 17 : 00 pm .
the programme starts on Sunday at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 17h the prizes are dis@@ counted .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe does false speech in Parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe , oldest African leaders , fell the steps at the beginning of the year .
he was un@@ hurt , but the video of the fall was quickly spread about the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also imp@@ elled by the claims of representatives of the opposition that they received an anonymous death thre@@ aten , and they were warned of contributing to Mr Mug@@ abe in wor@@ ship@@ ments .
last month , they hat@@ ched him and stopped at his address to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the talk he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the democratic transition ( Movement for Democratic change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they were warned of Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number showing not the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mug@@ ab@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the parliamentary group warning us to termin@@ ate the immun@@ ity of parliament , and once they left the parliament , not effective any more effective parliamentary immun@@ ity .
the chef said , led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i @-@ led party , &quot; wor@@ ried about the d@@ angers for the politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to manufacture 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings efforts of the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP is divided into two listed companies , and the computer and printer business separate from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected deficit breakdown at a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , 2012 said HP in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive Officer on the separation after the separation .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and migh@@ tier than the HP today , and we have a broad and pro@@ found portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as a stand@@ alone company we are better installed than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ of revenues and is focusing on providing easy @-@ to @-@ reach , integrated technology solutions for companies , so an Declaration of the Company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , whose Palo Alto garage has been called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;
hp has a massive restructuring running to handle the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers and one of the largest US @-@ tech company , is the newest in this area that is based on convic@@ tion that closely focused company has a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand against the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger stressed by Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only in September and when his rehabilitation after plans , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back on Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario reveals that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss out at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is still uns@@ cre@@ ted .
the great dis@@ grace at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly completed the last season after a separate an@@ kl@@ el@@ ic@@ tion , and then returned to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
there is a bone , which not healed .
this is not a matter of matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries that he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as W@@ enger is recognized , there is the associated threat of other injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it has also been an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries , posted 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ as 157 Lig@@ ure playing in the last five playing times .
the wider image for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 to show most of the injuries .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ies , but ar@@ senal estimated that there is an improvement in the injuries rate during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have to receive a vulner@@ able period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and combat force , &quot; said W@@ enger .
jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope that his body stabil@@ izes , I am hop@@ eful that he will do it and will go through a career from the way he deser@@ ves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and at Tot@@ ten@@ ham hot@@ lane next Wednesday , and W@@ enger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled not to Croatia , which means the Math@@ ieu Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta are going to start .
W@@ enger is also able to play Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and to players who need it to gain a little break down , &quot; said W@@ enger .
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to continue through group F , Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the slots for use with the largest show effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also defeated by 41 games after the &quot; Un@@ sealed &quot; campaign started in last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday , where the Richter scale was 3,2 .
this year was the 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn up the doctrine of last season with the Champions League @-@ surrender to Monaco and remains in excess hope to lead the association with his management to his first European triumph .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never been folded in Arsenal .
we were in 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand I am long enough in the business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are no dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which give us serious lessons about defects
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open , now even more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ ing amongst young men on a 15 @-@ year high proof .
by 2013 , it was the most important death cause with men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains for more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ als ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a erb@@ ated life ) 2015 tells the year of a man with the aim of trying the culture in question to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the heart in order to master this challenge .
a recent study involving over 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ compression symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer has a suff@@ iciently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; its chances of enjoy@@ ment has doubled .
for those who are non @-@ pressed , a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends are the risks of mental problems .
but of course you only need to have friends , so that a friendship can function .
in the age of over social media communication , with its focus on style on substance , the prefer@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to appear very , vi@@ bran@@ ded and successfully , even when the isolation is dominated in reality .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values indicate ; money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship which affects our mental health more accurately .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really don &apos;t buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was on the head .
each character has not been determined by his work , but by his personality , to the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent types of h@@ ugs , mom@@ ents of the football team in cozy as@@ cri@@ es and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel -- all that came out of the knowledge that men can refer to everyone , even though they often keep back to explore completely their feelings .
as a staff of telephone bet@@ ting care , it told me : ... &quot; my in@@ cess@@ ation role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ end@@ anger@@ ed , has showed me clearly what even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old speech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you are talking about problems &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes in the sense when I try to offer long @-@ term indicator mechanisms .
it presents all the small moments of male friends .
so far my objective of out@@ sider status via the telephone calls for people in ocular surfaces can also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you come to this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day totally redesigned back@@ drop , why do not take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better when you see someone alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello to it .
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
friends is broadcast on Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to v@@ ise Malmö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his search for Malmö .
di Mary meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move on Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani counted course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria achieved less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who put the French masters on the way , but thereafter adjusted it a number of occasions before they finally achieved a head of a head in Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ etsk , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish Master , as it takes not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds but an improvement on the path to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while she got the points , it was not a classical game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ in Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics hidden opportunities before the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home @-@ home team and against the association , with whom he already began distribut@@ ing his lively career back in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or in ward in the Champions League . thus , it &apos;s a good start to create 2 : 0 , even if there is certain things we have to achieve even more perfect during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I am sorry that we didn &apos;t have one or two more gates . &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned to his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that was able to hold its own rank against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was thrown in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ean bush was called to take the PS@@ G on the next level in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he interpreted , why , when he ran down in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö Defense , before moving to Johan Wil@@ and handed it back into the long corner of the network .
however , if som@@ eb@@ ody believed that PS@@ G would be a big win , it was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off stroke to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national@@ ities at the field and was excited with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy enemy .
but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who settled in Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s post in the 3@@ 4th minute , offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself was sometimes on , with some patches with flaws and bad results , not least by Kos@@ him@@ ovic who was in no less than five attempts at first half and then abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had re@@ used him after re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his co @-@ player to play , and it was a pass by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was called Maria in a shooting down of Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the posts , ...
shortly after the hours mark , the second gate was at last shortly after the hours of the Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved its sixth install@@ ment after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic had attached a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this continued all thoughts that Malmö can go back to the game , and only an excellent intervention made by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final score low before the replacement player E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fications are not sufficient . &quot;
hat From above Paris !
it was a great game of them !

matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film format
matt Dam@@ on faced the universal @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown , during a discussion about diversity , said she will not be needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced performer Brown was stressed as they stressed the need of alternative perspectives , in reference to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak about diversity then you do it during the occupation of the movie and not in the occupation of the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brown re@@ acted with ins@@ ulated un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ ti@@ an was troubled .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production site Ben Mon@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to understand people to think about it - who will be still the director - how to treat the figure of the Harmony &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and it is a n@@ ut@@ te that is struck by their white all@@ age .
the producer of the De@@ er White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the direction @-@ rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direc@@ ting &apos; at the end might be something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded over ab@@ stain@@ ing over Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
s Twitter edited Mr Po@@ oni into his anger on the clip as he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on speaks about the only black person in the room so he can explain its diversity - that is SO Wein@@ ISS that does it hurt . &quot;
the twe@@ eter has been used more than 5.000 returns and 4,000 le@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time when accurate representation in media at the fore@@ front of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officers in 2014 , the movement of Black Li@@ ves travelled through a nationally negoti@@ ated effect and pressed fundamental practices to command @-@ discrimination .
in February , the singer Prince Street founded a record on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums silent &quot; ( albums still have their significance ) said he said .
like books and black lives , albums are still their significance .
in younger time , leader of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published a declaration in response to the question of Fox News character Elisabeth H@@ assel@@ beck to see if the group was considered a H@@ ass @-@ Group .
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Network is a love group , &quot; said the guide .
recently , it was recently announced that Dam@@ on has been on a list of Enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .

&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crowned the first champion
professional sport watch and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athl@@ ete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Great Prize of 1 Million $ with home .
the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , has never experienced a competition participants that could close all stages of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the finals .
the climbing on a 75 foot rope rope in 30 seconds was part of the climbing .
British finished the task within the period where he finished the first Ath@@ ena , who finished the first 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge to get full three seconds faster than the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard fought place , still under the shock of the great price of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or to live &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not suddenly .. as I can imagine , as it is ... the future is unknown .
the senior producer K@@ ent We@@ aver started to discuss the final with The Hollywood re@@ porter , and why Britain , although he ended the first course not at all , won &apos;t be any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , he receives one of the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ap@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changed life , it obt@@ ains the magnificent gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he is thinking about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero of his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be defeated by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac had felt the same time when she had been vacc@@ inated .
America Ninja Warrior was extended to an end of season which will start fil@@ ming in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers handed over to Minnesota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ N@@ APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in former times they were one of the best teams competing in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part in a perfect match against the Minnesota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the Twin@@ s covers an opportunity to climb for the second round of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second round of the 2nd American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , although only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ Word , which was able to handle so difficult for a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad pron@@ unci@@ ation .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon conducted his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 In@@ nings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was just the third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to quit this year , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ ls of each game , and therefore I will always concentrate to the game .
the designed tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ hit @-@ game in Mart@@ ine@@ z when he had four hits in Seattle on July 6 .
&quot; he has closed the striking wood as well , &quot; said it .
he looked good at the ( drums ) , saw clearly better from the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought them straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh In@@ nings , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a bun@@ ch , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y ran on the wall , the only man with whom he con@@ fron@@ ted , in front of the ro@@ ok@@ ie ro@@ ok@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano , the ro@@ man Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the finish Run in the second took the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe at one Double play .
it was this in the Major League leading 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe defeated a Double play
after Detroit added an Insurance Run in the end of the ninth , a R@@ B@@ I double with the bulk of the tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed ring however S@@ ano will replace the S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches .
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game of an even not moving by Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three yields in the first two inn@@ ings against the square @-@ handed veter@@ an , which was kn@@ itted in front of the play of the injuries list , having missed out more than a month because of a back of dor@@ sal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her first round off the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single of the second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ ger .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z succeeded in winning his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the lap@@ els in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Mi is followed with a single at the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get the third threat .
the tig@@ ers arrived in the second , having an One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ ding Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t che@@ ered well , but he caught the right spot .
Hug@@ hes was in a pitch @-@ count@@ down , did not score points in the third inning , before it was replaced by the Rel@@ i@@ ever rectangle A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ens .
Hug@@ hes came to three hits at six hits and a walk with four kn@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : tiger R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez was the case for injury to their whel@@ ps .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since the middle of August on the danger of injuries for a shoulder break , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is on kn@@ itted by the injuries list to start the Twin@@ s .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 starts with four starts with the tiger , since it was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th of July
he ste@@ ed it on August 20th , because of a break down in the right hip .
the tig@@ ers and Twin@@ s will end their series of three games at the Target Field Related Games
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is going to play in Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )

no Di@@ et fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to take care for his sl@@ ender line , it is often not to be av@@ eng@@ ined from them .
as Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - mainly Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruit : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In addition , Mang@@ os contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta Carot@@ ene .
therefore , whoever e@@ ats the fruits , helps the immune system , the immune system and the metabolism process in the body .
at purchase , Mang@@ os should not be soft or to be firm and comfortable to smell .
the formwork color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so you can taste the green man@@ go very tasty .
they should be kept at room temperature and are consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course , or in sweet food .
a man@@ go also exists a special note and a special touch .
it mil@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf sal@@ ads such as Chic@@ o@@ ree and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

Rome has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the re@@ formation , there is a Martin Luther square in Rome .
in the presence of municipal president , Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been christ@@ ened in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill in the name of the German reform of Germany on Wednesday .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now recognized as the German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was promp@@ ted by the work community of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants could live in the town of the Pop@@ es over centuries , often only in the absence of their faith .
with the square become visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed as young August@@ ine mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city at that time , as a gift of sin .
its negative impressions may be impressed by the history of hist@@ ori@@ ans in his event@@ ful struggle against Rome in his event@@ ual battle .
Luther was then led up with his thes@@ es against the election of the Orthodox Church .
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the haupt@@ werke , painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ort has updated the introduction and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that now appeared with magnificent images .
at the beginning it was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 mot@@ ives had his personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colored colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means it means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective subjects can be adapted to the right thing .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on its bi@@ ble project for which he has made a sub@@ jective artistic selection of the many different themes of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
the cycles are the following cycles such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
he has fascin@@ ated spontan@@ e@@ ously several partners . this is true for the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ort , who set apart the basis of painting with the respective passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible and translated by Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated into current &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ consist@@ encies &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirror of aluminum painting .
nestled between the original Bible collection of Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist , representing his personal thoughts on the respective situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden let@@ ters .
the 75 year old allows twice a deep insight into its soul , its emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were all in all the trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ n@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing ever happened with the cane @-@ stock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he reminds of Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to aband@@ on this , that perhaps again to bear with the Father &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern was to help art again in faster time again : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery today has been min@@ ted today by Rek@@ lame , and they are loud .
symbol@@ ism is wrapped up .
artists have a different desire and del@@ ights to show things .
ones always have some kind of mystery and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer in the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let them go , discover and feel that force they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ort carried out on Tuesday during the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art to be &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art &quot; : &quot; I like how he under@@ stands life with his paintings . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to know the Bible completely , but also chosen for him important , even mysterious issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was no co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says legacy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; written a few images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öhler &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en &quot; his life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öhler &apos;s ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and fl@@ ax@@ frames - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
beginning of construction for BM@@ X railroad
plans made , place , companies assigned to mod@@ eled Earth for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished .
dis@@ s@@ ew@@ ays in politics and administration , especially in local residents , especially in local residents , who would not toler@@ ate the rail@@ ways .
so hill sh@@ ielded up , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the permit will enter in October , the first common community of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock was now able to communicate its children in the chil@@ dr@@ ens and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year will happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that would then be without &quot; additional &quot; break &quot; work with the work at the former s@@ wimming@@ pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to a p@@ inion situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy with the help of the related problems .
&quot; I think it &apos;s the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say , that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interested in each particular subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Sch@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 23 September in Berlin , at the annual meeting in Berlin , Angela Merkel will intensi@@ fy the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State Minister O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a key role to play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could help and help .
the decisive turn@@ outs must however represent politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the German Football Federation has therefore expanded his refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made sure this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Tar@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some German companies support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ts are a clear sign when it instead of the left tri@@ cot kern@@ els of the otherwise usual Spon@@ sor@@ ption name ( Hermes ) will help the slogan &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; will carry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make sure that everyone , and how they can only help , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and called the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama believes every one , nobody can go away . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t need a soccer field , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and opportunity to help many refugees who have already suffered as an unbeliev@@ ably &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hop@@ en@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig said of a &quot; famous sign of the League &quot; .
for the EM @-@ qualifying match against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invite 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach , the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football &quot;
that all 36 license deals in their own projects would be great .
the same thing is so great that small and smallest dec@@ ays are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have spent in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum of 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported por@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ CEO lose an eye on an accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost its left eye in several reports by a fall in July .
following the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell after midnight on a water glas that he has borne in the left hand , reports the &quot; Business Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost extinct , he was a son out of dra@@ g@@ ged down to the streets - that tells us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founded Has@@ well Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go through his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early October , we meet in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old managers are involved in the meeting and are &quot; fully operational . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the South German newspaper &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s Edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continuing to the software @-@ group .
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I stand the whole time in regular contact with the supervisory board and his chairman Has@@ well flat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t travels between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer included in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to have such a personal story to the public , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again , if you please me . &quot;

soccer : Bv@@ B without prec@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : fran@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes raised to a com@@ eback issued by Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League finally .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the soccer league in the Du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 clock / Sky ) .
&quot; we can not look back at him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said on Wednesday .
whether Re@@ us will be playing in the Bundesliga in the Bundesliga game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ F coach was open to : &quot; we expect a return from him into the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high stress due to its pro@@ s Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his wife &apos;s eleven settings on the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change to the ke@@ epers .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of St@@ art@@ keeper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el made it open .
with high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ged statements by Mit@@ ch Re@@ us that the Fin@@ al@@ entry of the Bv@@ B in the Europe League must be the target , holds the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for re@@ tra@@ ce@@ able : &quot; it &apos;s not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to adopt the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to lead a pione@@ ering role in Germany
in Germany , Germany shall be on the change of the Federal Government on the change of the technological pioneer .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of traffic authority Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which pre@@ clu@@ ded investments in the extension of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the auto @-@ fair IAA from a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
the automated and networked drive will increase the traffic safety and care for less st@@ resses , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the subject , with his counter@@ part , the G7 , who also discuss the industry and representatives of the industry .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Commerce emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and an efficient conversion on digital radio stations .
at the time of testing new technology , a test route is currently on motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability @-@ risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to verify the legal conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make itself globally , that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
in addition , the German government plans to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which previously only sees the people as driver .
when automated driving offers the car the guided tour , the driver will become more and more .
the technology is especially based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study by the Economic Affairs department , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
nevertheless , drivers are still waiting to be expected on public roads &quot; until 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the areas of Driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at location Germany will appreciate the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD Transport S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol said .
the issue of liability in accidents and security of personal data of the driver must clearly be clari@@ fied .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than Fr@@ ench@@ man or Americans .
one on the AA pre @-@ established survey by the For@@ sa Institute in order to determine that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous car drivers will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent count in 20 years that 31 percent would not believe it .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents have reached 33 percent of those surveyed by 2025 .
in Germany , drivers in Germany are not ready to leave themselves on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey by the digital network B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire voyage on all roads .
on the motorway , road traffic could imagine even 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent .
good each birds would leave the car under no circumstances .

this time was at the time of the flight to a long @-@ term agreed Spon@@ sor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to be back on Friday .

Gaul@@ tier feels to be old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mix of very large Mo@@ den@@ schau and a wax figures - Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins search out human beings thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they bear the spectacular creation of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as out@@ fit out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he founded men in Sk@@ irt .
&quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant in the Haute C@@ out@@ ure , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was light , now it &apos;s real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 to the Kunsth@@ alle in the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a fortune that the model has changed its first dis@@ le@@ aning post@@ ure to a vision of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was actually , because , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , there was a little bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you arrive in the museum .
the impressive collection was previously done in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it desc@@ end to tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hard work of a man who has written fashion history without ever completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the vision is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed work of works for which much effort has been used : to fr@@ ize the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist is engaged .
14 tons of material have dar@@ ed according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot according to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October , there was another special barrel : a leather tri@@ mmer with cor@@ s@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he is still interested in strong women ( &quot; women are sh@@ au as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
also Gaul@@ lists old Teddy is to be seen at the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ onal mo@@ on@@ ical experiments of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) he asked his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said .
when playing a doll , his parents would not allowed him .
the discharge of fashion he later taught itself afterwards .
he st@@ ole fashion journ@@ als and saw the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought the apartment but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the dum@@ ps .
jewel@@ s instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ zer tip than fashion N@@ ic
previously it went to the long embroi@@ der@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ zen to do this .
the embroi@@ dered substances and tips originated in large quantities for customers that they had for example to bl@@ ank@@ ets and curtains .
the alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ ffer .
instead the mode is important again .
in the beginning of the Pl@@ au@@ ger tip , mode played a bigger role , then tra@@ vers@@ ed by the Tex@@ tiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and with regional b@@ ays .
even in all , the so @-@ called Vintage @-@ Mode , which emerged in the past sty@@ li@@ stic sense of sty@@ li@@ stic sense of style , is an increasing customer potential .
those who don &apos;t operate N@@ ish in the textile branch in Germany is no longer available on the market .
in our case , they already make up half of all the jobs .
Mo@@ ot@@ apes Set@@ ting is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener on top and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only you may bear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 per cent of its sales have been broken .
private business and wholesale accounts are almost no longer .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
the mass product nowadays become much cheaper today in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
there are also weak@@ le of export , currently on Russia and the USA .
plenty of reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to run through environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ der@@ y plant in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since that year , we have shown a seal of quality so we will produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduated engineer U@@ te Schmidt from the Faculty of Applied Arts , University of Applied Arts - graduated from the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialised in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to put something to the competition from the Asian region , one must find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a voltage area between the hat@@ ch@@ ant ideas of designers and companies that need to think about especially economical , &quot; says Shi@@ res .
therefore , a existing design often varies only slightly , to keep a customer base .
some years ago animated textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historical snow @-@ tip of the snow .
the machine sends little cows to some places .
the pl@@ au@@ zer gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ls had inspired them to in@@ spire : &quot; before that , I could do nothing at traditional stage . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ tip for their jewelry .

EU wants to double mercury in space @-@ fishing
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in big rough@@ ness and consumption a significantly higher dose of nerve damage .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which lies an adequate staff of the EU , critic@@ ized the plans for industrial and environmental policy , with full of W@@ ought to pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained by Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is to estimate the limit values of the nerve fibers such as Hai@@ g or Sch@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
big prem@@ ise fish already exist so strongly with mercury that are not sold on the basis of the limits imposed by some 50 per cent of the length .
after dou@@ bling of the limits , only 14.5 percent would be available individually .
in return for this loos@@ ening the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
the F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ ry , like some car@@ p mostly imp@@ acted as low as they already comply with the planned maximum values already today .
therefore , the ab@@ dic@@ ation of cl@@ ash was therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ brill@@ ation of de@@ fle@@ ction , that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is one for man &apos;s highly toxic heavy metal , which has strongly enriched over the food chain particularly in prey @-@ fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts of damage caused by un@@ born damage to the nerve system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may cause some small amounts of damage to the nerve system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment declared on his website with regard to the current limit values , but that a &quot; health haz@@ ards &quot; of the general population has not been expected .
mercury is mainly through coal combustion inside the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , I@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck ordered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of Germany em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in Elbe , Rhine and Danube had become &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; had been quoted as &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March from the paper .
in the past year , wide war@@ nings of mercury in fish had already been applied to the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
