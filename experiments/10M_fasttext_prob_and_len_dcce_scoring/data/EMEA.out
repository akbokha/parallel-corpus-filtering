&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets , which can trigger in the mouth ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
B. wir@@ res thinking and Speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar disorder ; • Bi@@ polar disorder ( periods ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood ( periods ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of medium @-@ heavy episodes and prevention of man@@ ic episodes with patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is applied to the fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the or@@ ale intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution to take or the mel@@ ting tablets are used in patients to prepare the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines , which are just as lov@@ ingly designed , the dose of an@@ bili@@ fy should be adapted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the transmission of the transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; , i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l pres@@ um@@ ably appears mainly as a &quot; parti@@ te Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and D@@ op@@ amine , but in the lower dimensions as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter acts to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role , contributes Ari@@ pi@@ ping to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ occur will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of bili@@ fy , to prevent the re@@ occur of symptoms , was examined in three studies up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases , which compared to increased un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study A@@ gro@@ fy about twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of an@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent re@@ occur in 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy , compared to . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of arom@@ a@@ fy inj@@ ections was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which compared to increased un@@ rest , with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients by a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients that were examined on treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also led studies in order to investigate , as the body mel@@ ting the mel@@ ting tablets and the solution to inv@@ itations . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients , A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 75 mg or 15 mg have received a significant reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder decreased arom@@ an@@ fy in four of the five short term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy they also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than plac@@ ebo the re@@ occur of man@@ ic episodes with previously treated patients and if it was in addition to an existing treatment has been administ@@ ered .
herbal inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for one ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , he@@ ath@@ is@@ y ( continuous movement ) , he@@ ada@@ ches ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , flu@@ ids , nau@@ sea ( increased memory ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( sing@@ ular ) and anxiety . &quot;
the committee for human medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predomin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l An@@ languages to over@@ sei@@ ze the risks .
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ ections in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes with Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder if a or@@ ial therapy is not suitable to prevail over the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission dedicated to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for launching A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar bi@@ al disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients indicated mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l An@@ languages ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a post@@ ure dose of 15 mg / day once daily independent of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initi@@ ate dose when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ tor is set out of the combination therapy should be reduced the Ari@@ pi@@ d dose to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ ic@@ ide behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; the results of an epidem@@ i@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , no increased su@@ ic@@ ism risk with Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( M@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac diseases ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ation ( de@@ hydr@@ ation ) , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia ( de@@ hydr@@ ated drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and Mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which have been a year or less di@@ gesti@@ ble , there were occa@@ sional reports of during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l asc@@ ending Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
if at one with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
&quot; when a patient indication and symptoms developed to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high f@@ ever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be set , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with cranes in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states that are applied with s@@ amp@@ ou@@ ling in connection with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l treated in patients with psych@@ osis who were treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ v , a increased ster@@ ber@@ is@@ iko compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study involving fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the contact for unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ial box or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose values . &quot;
&quot; a weight can be found in general for schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ag@@ m patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ age , using anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines such as Se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy prob@@ abilities a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore ought to be done similar dos@@ is@@ ions . &quot;
at CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ier@@ ers can result the joint application with highly effective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma @-@ concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l - compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sively si@@ zing met@@ abolic disorders .
if one draws the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should sei@@ ze the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eins , are likely to have similar effects and therefore ought to be done similar dos@@ is@@ ions . &quot;
after finishing the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors should be the dosage of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y to be raised to the dosage @-@ level before the start of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 will be administ@@ ered with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y can be calculated with an moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .

patients should be advised to notify their physician when they get pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety of people and due to the reproductive studies in pregnant women , this medicine may not be applied to pregnancy , unless the potential health benefits are clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , even with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be war@@ ned of , dangerous machines , including strength vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence . &quot;
the following side effects are more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) on than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ effects ( * ) :
&quot; the incidence of the side @-@ effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study has been treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l , a total of lower incidence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) from EPS including par@@ ins@@ on@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , ac@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term student over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l @-@ treatment and 13.5 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term student study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ per therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes with Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 53.@@ 3 % in patients under Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ dol @-@ treatment .
in another study more than 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l @-@ treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium treatment .
in the long @-@ time detection phase over 26 weeks at a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated patients .

&quot; CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3,5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l patients compared to 2.7 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , the Mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ l@@ ep@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esth@@ esia and increased mortality rates , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials and since the launch were un@@ int@@ enti@@ onal or int@@ enti@@ onal over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death succ@@ ession .
&quot; although no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis during the treatment of an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that her@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of a met@@ ering of benefits , since Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ v has a high plastic attack . &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ op@@ hr@@ enia at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a particip@@ ally agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ ors and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors , as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for the ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a , for alpha @-@ 1 hr@@ ad and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ Reci@@ pe . &quot;

in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ag@@ m patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled study was in week 52 the share of the Respon@@ ses patients who held an approach to study media , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ enger , defined as secondary study potenti@@ als , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depres@@ sed scale , showed a significant stronger improvement than at Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks due to stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia showed itself a significant higher reduction in the back rate that was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia at 26 weeks , the 314 patients were converted to a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the starting value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;

&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy propor@@ tions , as well as in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ener patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a pop@@ e @-@ specific evaluation of Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic affili@@ ation or the impact of the c@@ enser to the Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l .
the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy propor@@ tions .

&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood types , in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications occur in case before the procedure is not possible and in which a blood loss is not possible from 900 to 1 800 ml . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who owns experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the drug is shown .
&quot; in case of patients with kidney problems and for patients who want to make a peculi@@ ar blood , is Ab@@ se@@ amed to a v@@ ene to inj@@ ecting . &quot;
injection can also be made from the patient or his super@@ visor if they have appropriate instructions for this purpose .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or patients who receive an chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds are always in recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ it@@ res in adults or between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients have to control before the treatment , to ensure that no iron bracket is , and iron det@@ ents should be administ@@ ered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who receive an chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems can be caused by a er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ des@@ man@@ gel or by means that the body does not speak sufficient to the physical er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied against operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as injection in a v@@ ene in the framework of a major study with 479 patients suffering caused by kidney @-@ problems with the reference problems .
all patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were included in a v@@ ene or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were received .
major indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds between the beginning of the study and the participation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin was investigated with those from E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received an chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study with patients suffering caused by kidney @-@ problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries of patients were created on se@@ wage levels , in the same measure , as with the patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to that the patients , which continued by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , a rise from 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , who occasionally lead to symp@@ tom of an encephalopath@@ y ( brain problems ) as sudden , st@@ aging he@@ ada@@ ches and Tur@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may possibly be vulnerable ( allergic ) against ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection among the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof , the drug has a comparable quality , safety and effic@@ acy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

if the HB increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a HB value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) is required to minimize the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ osis an@@ emia ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ y@@ conditional an@@ emia - Dos@@ age custom@@ ization between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
&quot; the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk involving the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who are intended for greater el@@ ect@@ or@@ thodon@@ tic intervention , if possible , prior to the beginning of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from an enlarged orthop@@ edic procedure should get an adequate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis because they have a increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly with a primary cardiovascular disease . &quot;
furthermore it may not be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa for patients with an initial sh@@ ot@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ed by &gt; 13 g / dl a raised risk for post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events .

A@@ cl@@ asta is applied to the treatment of the following diseases : • O@@ ste@@ opor@@ osis ( an ail@@ ment that makes the bones spr@@ ink@@ de ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high Fr@@ ak@@ tur@@ ris@@ iko ( bone breaks ) , including patients who suffered a little trau@@ mati@@ st hips like when they stum@@ bled ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of bone , a disease , which changed the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus p@@ et should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fres@@ hness should be obtained from the first inf@@ usion of a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against infl@@ amm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta may be reduced in the three days following the inf@@ usion of inf@@ usion , such as f@@ ever , muscle aches , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ als and he@@ ada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta may only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingre@@ dient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; during the first study nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine has been studied over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study deals with 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered a hip re@@ frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta has been tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared to six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effic@@ acy was whether the sal@@ ary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate are in the Ser@@ um ( a enzy@@ me , the bone substance demol@@ ishing ) in the blood back to norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the starting value . &quot;
in the study with older women the risk of wh@@ irl@@ pools were reduced in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under plac@@ ebo the risk of hips was reduced by 41 % .
&quot; in the study involving males and women with hip , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta tow@@ el ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days of inf@@ usion and are less common in re@@ peti@@ tive inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who may possibly be vulnerable ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other Bis@@ phosph@@ or or one of the other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ asta the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the inf@@ usion station and O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( dying of bone fabric ) in the pine . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides educational material for doctors , the A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , the indications contains how the drug applies , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are discussed and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men will be recommended as in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ asta once a year .
&quot; in case of patients with low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , the administration of inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hips ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta should be used only by doctors , the experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long re@@ vocation period was observed in patients who have addressed to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable when patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate supply of calcium , corresponding to twice a day at least 500 mg cap , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent learned low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , a initi@@ al@@ d@@ dose from 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D especially recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days of administration of A@@ cl@@ asta may be reduced by G@@ abe of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( see Section 4.4 ) In case of patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for these patients .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger . &quot;
&quot; children and adol@@ esc@@ ents A@@ cl@@ asta will not be recommended for the use in children and young people under the age of 18 , as data for im@@ mortality and effectiveness are missing . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
an advanced Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is before the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta due to sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid introduction of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone construction , a temporary , with@@ drawn in symp@@ tom@@ atic hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is able to develop their maximum usually within the first 10 days of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable when patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate supply of calcium , corresponding to twice a day at least 500 mg cap , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;

the change of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( yearly before administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure and a restricted N@@ ier@@ en@@ function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years compared to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of the Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after G@@ abe was observed at 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients compared to 0.7 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on evaluating the laboratories , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic cal@@ zi@@ um values , which apply below the normal spon@@ ge range ( less than untreated m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.@@ 3 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta in a great clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the mor@@ bus p@@ ago@@ et studies . &quot;

effects on morph@@ ometric flu@@ ids A@@ cl@@ asta sen@@ sed significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or more new wh@@ irl@@ pools ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a reduced amount of 60 % reduced risk for vert@@ eb@@ re@@ frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 0001 ) .
effects on hips A@@ cl@@ asta proved a equ@@ itable effect over three years in one around 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % up to 58 % ) reduced risk of hips . &quot;
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased the bone density on the lum@@ bar range compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment significantly compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta reduced by SAP under 12 months decreased by 30 % compared to the starting value and was held at 28 % below the starting value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting value after 12 months and has been kept under 52 % below the starting value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X has been significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting point after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the starting value to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirror were not measured not lined , but the majority of patients received a initial ss@@ r@@ osis vitamin D ( 5@@ 0,000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.e. , oral or in@@ tra us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the overall mor@@ tal was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group with A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated group , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D at all times of time .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment led over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.5 % at the overall level and around 4.@@ 3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als .
clinical effectiveness in men In the HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized 5@@ 08 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in males ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8,@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) was the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to the once weekly transformation of the Len@@ me@@ bel BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the starting value .
&quot; clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the fem@@ ur A@@ cl@@ asta became examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moderate @-@ mirror of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ triple @-@ specific upper normal ( in the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months case studies .
with the combined results after 6 months a similar acceptance of pain pressure and pain@@ less influenced compared to the starting value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
&quot; patients , which were classified as a Respon@@ si@@ bilities before the end of the sixth month ( in therapy ) , were included in a follow @-@ up phase . &quot;
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treatment patients , the therapeutic approach to 141 of using A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 of using Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treatment treated patients , maintained in a mid @-@ term duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multi@@ ples 5 and 15 minutes continuous inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients takes the following pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plas@@ mas@@ bar took up rapidly from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; hot bi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic dis@@ appearance of the large cycle with half times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ -@@ 24 hours , followed by a long elimination of elimination with a tempor@@ al elimination of ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) represent probably the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the dose dose in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone fabric . &quot;
&quot; the entire body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h , and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the withdrawal of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ym - concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ation against time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems met@@ aboli@@ zed substances is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not yet met@@ aboli@@ zed by humans and because they are a watch@@ ful or not direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , material @-@ dependent In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 45@@ 0@@ - &quot;

this makes a light ( Cl@@ one = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive amount of incl@@ ine dis@@ rup@@ ting up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid requires .
&quot; because of serious kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only restricted data are possible for these Population . &quot;

&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta works by adding the bone @-@ construction , a normal bone @-@ formation , and thus gives the bones to strength again . &quot;
&quot; if you are suffering in dental treatment or need to under@@ go any dental surgery , please inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; using A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or toil@@ et@@ ries , if you have to take other medicines / apply or applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you take drugs , of which is known that they compens@@ ate the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ asta together with food and drinks , you are worried that you have to take enough liquid according to the instructions of your physician to take enough liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dosage is 5 mg once per year that will allow you to be administ@@ ered by your doctor or the patient as an inf@@ usion into a v@@ ene .
&quot; if you have recently broken down the hips , is recommended to make appointments by A@@ cl@@ asta 2 or more weeks after the operative care of the hips . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et The usual dosage is 5 mg that will allow you to be administ@@ ered by your doctor or the patient as an inf@@ usion into a v@@ ene .
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ asta works for a long time , you will possibly need a further dose after a year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions exactly , so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after the inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; by Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta can work for more than one year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Library report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) has been evaluated in order to make recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied solely ( Mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ drug medicine ) can be applied together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ drug medicine ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be satisfac@@ tory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or ins@@ ulin can be maintained the present dose of Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ate or ins@@ ulin with the beginning of the Ac@@ cor@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ atives or ins@@ ulin can be reduced .
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s physical ins@@ ulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar levels , thus reducing type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes . &quot;
&quot; for more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ Therapy has been studied ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff , in addition they received either ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood was measured ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed Hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar have been lo@@ wer@@ ed by using the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts for existing treatment performed with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff in a reduction in h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values at 50 % , while the additional G@@ abe of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and ins@@ ulin for 289 patients were examined , the patients , the accounts in addition to ins@@ ulin , compared with 0,@@ 14 % in patients compared with 0,@@ 14 % in patients who were in addition plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects in connection with acet@@ tos were t@@ end@@ ous disorders , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( col@@ ds ) , weight increase and hy@@ po@@ esth@@ esia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to irrit@@ ating ) . &quot;
accounts may not be used in patients who may possibly be vulnerable ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or dia@@ be@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ial - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos within the framework of a monopol@@ otherapy ( in some use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients serve , where Met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission published the European Commission Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited permit a permit for the transport of accounts within the European Union .
&quot; tablets are white until white , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also shown to combine with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar has been inadequate and in which met@@ form@@ in due to con@@ train@@ dic@@ ations or intoler@@ ance is in@@ appropriate ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for use by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at risk with the presence at least one risk factor ( such as former cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , a de@@ composition of heart failure , should begin medical treatment with the lowest possible dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , gaining weight or oil @-@ suff@@ iciency , especially those with reduced kar@@ st reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , gaining weight and o@@ dem@@ e when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was carried out .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
patients with increased output hep@@ atitis ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror up to 3 @-@ fold the upper limit of the standard are increased , the liver values are as soon as possible to control again . &quot;
&quot; if a patient &apos;s symptoms developed to refer to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , fatigue , appeti@@ te loss and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver values to check . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient should be continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be led to the fore@@ front of the laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ @-@ dependent weight can be found , which can be glori@@ fied by li@@ pos@@ ing and in some cases associated with a hydr@@ ation re@@ tention . &quot;
as a result of a hem@@ or@@ tion occurred under therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a lower reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and of the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.3 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ ram by 3.3 % ) and at a lower level also in patients under Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ og@@ ram by 1 @-@ 2 % ) and of the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.3 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitive , with patients , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale branch therapy or as a two @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin delivery , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch was reported in the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ans , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , above an appearance or deterioration of a dia@@ be@@ tic Mak@@ ul@@ e@@ dem@@ s , with a reduction in the visual ac@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ es , but negoti@@ ating doctors should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ s , if patients report on disorders of visual shar@@ p@@ ops ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic evaluation should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of noti@@ fic@@ tional events regarding bone br@@ akes out of random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ based clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the reck@@ oning frac@@ ture was 1,@@ 9 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patients with the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on @-@ treated women and 1,@@ 1 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women , who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study on 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , Fr@@ ak@@ tures appeared in 44 / 870 ( 5.2 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; the patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or enter this , is the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics or Phar@@ mak@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes met@@ aboli@@ zed , e.g. or@@ ale contr@@ ab@@ tiv@@ a , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) results in an increase in the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ In@@ du@@ p ) results in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attribut@@ able that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which decreased hyper@@ ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the wom@@ ens and thus reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change of the tur@@ mo@@ ors and the b@@ illing index@@ es of the lens as well as with other hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emic agents .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ goat on the three @-@ fold the upper limit of the norm@@ als also appeared frequently on how to plac@@ ebo , however more rare than in compar@@ ative groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
&quot; in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was the frequency of a severe heart suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 1,@@ 6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the launch has rarely been reported about heart suff@@ iciency in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it became a summary analysis of reports of undes@@ irable inci@@ dents , controlled , double @-@ based clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on @-@ treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients associated with compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , Fr@@ ak@@ tures appeared at 44 / 870 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) who treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on @-@ treated patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; taking the reported peak dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days there are no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which results in the animal model to an increased incidence of liver , fat and sk@@ elet@@ on muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the gl@@ cos@@ e@@ production is reduced in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral gl@@ cos@@ ity in the case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was initiated over two years to investigate the time until the post of therapeutic effects ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control was defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ tro@@ l@@ filed study on 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three im@@ on@@ ati@@ ger optimization phase with ins@@ ulin delivery was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value around 0,45 % , compared to the patients who continued only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction in the ins@@ ulin @-@ treated group was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over one year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed statisti@@ cally significant acceptance of the album / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ mer@@ ot@@ ien@@ cies in comparison to the output values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks investigation into type @-@ 2 dia@@ be@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction in the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide and the free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low @-@ style , however clin@@ ically not significant increased LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in comparison to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plasma @-@ matri@@ x@@ ide and the free fatty acids , and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was not statisti@@ cally significant increase in the LD@@ L cholesterol levels , while under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de decreased values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ y levels , this is both an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ id absorption and the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ id synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ osis disease in groups were random@@ ized over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ dia@@ be@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy . &quot;
&quot; after an application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is fast res@@ or@@ ted , with the peak concentration on un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma is usually reached 2 hours of application . &quot;
&quot; based on M @-@ IV , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ action studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on could not affect the relevant effect on Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or Phar@@ mak@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ In@@ du@@ p ) increased or lowers the plasma concentration by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to oral application of radio@@ active marked Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at the human being the mark@@ er was mainly found in the wood ( 55 % ) , and to a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ Period of un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the entire active met@@ abolic rate lies at 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abolic disorders are lower compared to patients with reduced kidney function , whereas the edges of the or@@ al clear@@ ance of the native substance is similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred at mice , rats , dogs and monkeys con@@ voting after re@@ peti@@ tive administration of Plas@@ ma@@ ths , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible cardi@@ op@@ ic heart hyper@@ trop@@ ic . &quot;
this is attribut@@ able that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which is dimin@@ ished in the formation of hyper@@ ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the uter@@ ine substr@@ ates and reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were taken at the rat increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asi@@ es ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( with male re@@ chat ) of the ur@@ inary bladder indu@@ ces .

in another study more than two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were examined .
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed statisti@@ cally significant acceptance of the album / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ mer@@ ot@@ ien@@ cies in comparison to the output values . &quot;
in a study more than 20 weeks reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide levels that can be used both via a effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cer@@ id absorption as well as the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ o@@ id synthesis .

&quot; if the ur@@ inary tract can still be increased over 6 mg for up to four weeks , the dose can be increased once daily 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment series , the patients can still occur and therefore , advised that patients take at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for prevention of fork waste . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and for patients who had an organic transpl@@ ant since these groups were not examined .
&quot; in the first study , on the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effic@@ acy of various aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with that of a plac@@ ebo ( proj@@ ections ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other medicines to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ ide ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study two doses were compared by Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) one year long at 762 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day .
&quot; the main indicator of the effic@@ acy was the number of patients , their ur@@ inary tract in the blood of the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , Aden@@ auer in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients , which took once daily 120 mg in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no of 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ ches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , in patients with cardi@@ ac disease , perhaps a increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the committee for human cells ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the reduction of ur@@ inary tract , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;

the primary effic@@ acy point was in every study of the proportion of patients where the last three month of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sa@@ ur@@ inary tract &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) for patients with a ser@@ ver@@ incre@@ mental in@@ worth to study beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed in terms of lowering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sa@@ ur@@ inary tract ( see table 2 and picture 1 ) the statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority both of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .

lowering of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sa@@ ur@@ els on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in a range 2 and kept permanently over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ or@@ bit@@ in@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
primary End@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney functioning The AP@@ EX @-@ study rated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function ( d. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary effic@@ ien@@ cies of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients achieved . &quot;
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the process of ser@@ ren@@ al reg@@ ation of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ ore @-@ cent@@ ations with prob@@ ation of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney functioning ) .
primary end in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ lic@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( Bas@@ eline ) had a ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ laughter of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of an open extension study phase 3 showed that the long@@ term reduction of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sa@@ i w@@ ns on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) a decrease in incidence of incidence required ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required any treatment against a barrier ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the sealing size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of incl@@ ding up to month 24 for a row . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - Values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy trials increased the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma cent@@ ric time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration easier and multi @-@ pl@@ et doses from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ate .
for cans of 120 mg and 300 mg for Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is observed an increase in AU@@ C the greater than the dos@@ is@@ dis@@ proportion@@ ate increase .
after taking simple or multi @-@ pl@@ or@@ ical doses from 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is about 2.7 @-@ 3.3 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.6 µ@@ g / ml .
however no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ ap@@ centr@@ ation observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The seem@@ ing ste@@ ady @-@ state volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the Plas@@ tika rotation of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 99@@ ,@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached via the concentration of concentration , which is achieved with doses from 80 and 120 mg . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disease , in which the bones , are used in women after men@@ op@@ ause when a risk for a low vitamin D mirror consists . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or lease of other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , Cal@@ cium and Vit@@ amin@@ supplementary items ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take up until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet should not lie . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in drugs that are approved in the European Union , the company laid data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE in relation to increasing the vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror in patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE ( 11 % ) than those who took only Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also laid data before , which dar@@ ing that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE &apos;s dose @-@ dose exactly the dose which is required for the prevention of a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ ches , pain , or joints ) and symptoms of diges@@ tive apparatus such as ab@@ stain@@ ing , dy@@ she@@ ep@@ y ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation ( di@@ aly@@ sis ) , ul@@ cer@@ eal ab@@ dom@@ en ( br@@ anded belly ) as well as sau@@ res breaking . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with possible over@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against aging , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can not stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 , the European Commission announced the European Commission of Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ men Ltd . a permit for the discharge of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE , throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; T @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with an outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; 710 &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or taking of medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium , and Show@@ cases supplement ) for the day . &quot;
following hints are exactly to be followed in order to decrease the risk of mis@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is supposed to be s@@ lu@@ red after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk to or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet becomes . &quot;
B. pep@@ tic Ul@@ timo , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal blo@@ cking or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only under particular attention ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; ec@@ tual responses , like Ö@@ soph@@ agi@@ tis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ sions , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these severe and required a path@@ ogen@@ ic instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms which may indicate to possible hin@@ oc@@ ular reactions like Dy@@ cel@@ ag@@ ie , pain@@ s when pressing or retro@@ ster@@ ous pain or a new or lim@@ mer@@ ging of So@@ d@@ ging the medicines and get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of serious d@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients , which may not take the medicine correctly and / or it is after the appearance of symptoms resulting in an indu@@ ce irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dos@@ ing transactions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large covered clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no elevated risk was established , rare ( after market launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pin@@ ewood , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including O@@ ste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therap@@ ist ime in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously administ@@ ered Bis@@ phosph@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , giving notice whether the susp@@ ending of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate treatment in patients who require a k@@ ale surgical procedure , reduces the risk of an O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pin@@ ewood . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the treat@@ ment@@ ing doctor is binding for the therapy planning with each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be dependent on taking care of the intake of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets per day , but taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
&quot; other diseases that affect the mineral change ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dal ) , should be treated before the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE . &quot;
&quot; aging food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acid and some or@@ ale medicines may imp@@ air the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait after taking the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific Inter@@ action studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without having clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither applicable during pregnancy nor by mis@@ sive women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of direct damag@@ ing effects in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pin@@ ewood was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ ates ; most of the reports come from cancer patients but also has been reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
&quot; however , Ab@@ um @-@ Cal@@ cium up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Ser@@ um@@ - phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl ( l m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ym as a result of an oral over@@ dose , hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract , like Mag@@ en@@ vers@@ al , So@@ d@@ burn , Ö@@ soph@@ agi@@ tis , Gast@@ ri@@ tis or Ul@@ zer@@ a occur . &quot;

the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ym on bone mass and frac@@ tional women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture study ( F@@ IT : N = 6.@@ 459 ) .

fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ tro@@ l@@ ded studies where al@@ end@@ ron@@ ym was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily to be taken over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily gift of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at the appearance of at least a new spine decreased by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

&quot; the bio@@ availability took place in accordance with the earnings per cent of the transaction , if al@@ end@@ ron@@ ym was taken one or half an hour before a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ym was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;

&quot; since tac@@ tic and pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ e have already been used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study was submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transpl@@ antation , whereby the application of Adv@@ ance was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transpl@@ ant after a treatment of a year was stopped by one year ( by example , how often a renewed organic transpl@@ ant or a revival of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , temporary further studies on 119 patients were carried out with liver transpl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant and studied , as an advoc@@ acy compared to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ ating from the body . &quot;

&quot; in case of patients with possible over@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , mac@@ ro @-@ antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors have to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs will be taken simultaneously with an Adv@@ ance as the Adv@@ ance dosage or the dose of at the same time should be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors that are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transpl@@ ant patients should arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , this can lead to tran@@ splan@@ ts or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ tic formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; surveys of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the narrow contrac@@ tor of experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in consequence of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic monitoring and corresponding dosage adap@@ tations must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ance should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood levels . ( see below ) recommendations
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ance , the Tac@@ tic level should be controlled before conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the system@@ ic exposure , measured as Tal@@ mirror , with both formulations with both kidney and living @-@ tran@@ splan@@ ted patients comparable . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation under Adv@@ ance . to ensure proper substance exposure to immediate post @-@ tran@@ splan@@ ts .
&quot; since tac@@ tic is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , a adaptation of the Adv@@ ance @-@ Dos@@ is@@ hal@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
if the condition of patients in the first post@@ operative phase no or@@ ale intake of drugs may be in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentr@@ ates for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) .
the duration of application to supp@@ ression of tran@@ splan@@ ts must be sustained its immun@@ os@@ upp@@ oses ; in consequence , therefore a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - N@@ ier@@ entr@@ ants of proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ antation The or@@ ale Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - Extra mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning . &quot;
further dosage adap@@ tations may be required later as the Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change after the transpl@@ antation of the patient after the transpl@@ antation .
dosage recommendations - liver transpl@@ antation of the transpl@@ antation of transpl@@ antation The or@@ ale Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage intake - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf &apos;s must be converted to a tran@@ splan@@ ts of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Adv@@ ance , so this change@@ over in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
N@@ ier@@ - and liver transpl@@ ant After an switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ isti@@ va on Adv@@ ance once daily needs to start treatment with each in kidney and liver transpl@@ antation for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ antation .
heart tran@@ splan@@ ts In adult patients who will be converted to an Adv@@ ance is an or@@ ale initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day every day in the morning .
&quot; other tran@@ splan@@ ts - probably there is no clinical experience with an advoc@@ acy of lung cancer , pan@@ cre@@ atic and dar@@ m@@ tran@@ splan@@ ts patients in a or@@ al initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0,@@ 2 mg / kg / day and at intest@@ inal un@@ employed dose of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day to use . &quot;
dosage adap@@ tations in special patients groups with reduced liver function to maintain blood circulation in the target range can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a flo@@ ating of dose .
patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function has no effect on the Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
&quot; due to the neo @-@ liberal Pot@@ enti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ p@@ ine@@ equ@@ in@@ levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ine and an monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) . &quot;
switching of Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in at Adv@@ ag@@ raf in the conversion of a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - based on a tac@@ tic @-@ based therapy is caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the Tal@@ ver@@ mirror in full bl@@ age The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of absor@@ bing and compatibility with a state @-@ taking of full @-@ ut Tac@@ tic tac@@ tic controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ tic Tal@@ ru@@ m level during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation , followed by periodi@@ cal controls during the conservation therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood level of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m should also increase the conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ance , dos@@ is@@ ance , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous application of substances which could be controlled Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus con@@ cent@@ ric ble@@ eding ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since advoc@@ ates a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
&quot; the statements made in clinical studies make it possible that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the talents can not exceed the blood 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
in clinical practice the talents of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the first time after liver transpl@@ ant usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with im@@ pregn@@ ated patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the following initial treatment of liver and heart tran@@ splan@@ ts were generally used blood @-@ concentration in the range from 5 to 15 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; this has led to serious unwanted events , including transpl@@ antation or other side effects which can occur in a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ tic formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; surveys of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the narrow contrac@@ tor of experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ splan@@ ts , who proved to be therap@@ ist from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ isti@@ ans@@ as therapy , are not yet no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ance . &quot;
for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ splan@@ ts in adult heart tran@@ splan@@ ts and tran@@ splan@@ ts in the child age there are no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ance .
&quot; because of possible interactions that can lead to a lowering of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ b level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ tic ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies during treatment with Adv@@ ance . ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood , since the tactics can be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was referred to as Kar@@ di@@ omy@@ opath@@ y chamber or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ y , which can therefore also occur at an advoc@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid @-@ pollution and o@@ ils . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ation caused by suitable clothing or using a solar protection with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients taking the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for p@@ RES such as he@@ ada@@ ches , changed consciousness @-@ condition , cr@@ ushing and visual dys@@ functions , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; since advoc@@ acy tungsten cem@@ ented , retar@@ ded , t@@ act@@ ose , is provided in patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ intoler@@ ance , L@@ act@@ ase @-@ shor@@ tage or gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ painting . &quot;
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhi@@ bit@@ ors or indu@@ ction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus reduce blood levels of tactics .
it therefore recommends that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels with simultaneous gri@@ pping of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and which to adjust the Tac@@ tic concentr@@ ations according to maintaining even@@ ly concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
&quot; a strong interaction with An@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ol , as well as with the Macro@@ lid Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ oc@@ ular numbers ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies , that the increase in the blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , caused by the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal conver@@ gence . &quot;
high @-@ dos@@ si@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on how it is used in ac@@ ute waste actions can increase the concentration of tac@@ tic drugs in the blood or lower .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; hence the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabolism .
&quot; since tac@@ tic@@ li@@ m the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contr@@ ab@@ tiv@@ a can produce and thus increase the hormone exposure , is particularly careful when making decisions about recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal trying to have shown that tac@@ tic@@ li@@ mus potentially potentially potentially reduce the clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a low number of investigations on transpl@@ ant patients provide no indication that under tac@@ tic@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va a raised risk for unwanted events relating to the course and the outcome of pregnancy .

&quot; due to its high molecular weight@@ ed , its low water @-@ solu@@ ble and the high bond of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and Plas@@ map@@ rot@@ one can be accepted that tac@@ tic@@ li@@ m is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; associated mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level are likely to be convey@@ ed by its ties to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ish protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell@@ ular cell . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of Sign@@ al@@ trans@@ du@@ ction because of the T @-@ cell and thereby prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain set of l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

advoc@@ ates will be used for the treatment and prevention of blo@@ od@@ ations in patients with H@@ ash@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( one by the lack of factor VIII related blood @-@ disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of application depends on whether an advoc@@ ates for the treatment of blo@@ od@@ or or prevention of blo@@ od@@ ations in surgical procedures is applied .
&quot; patients with H@@ ash@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII , which causes blood problems like ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plasma , but after a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
&quot; advoc@@ ates is another in the European Union approved medicines called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but similarly , but the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medication was examined by means of prevention of blo@@ od@@ or as well as for surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ates has been awarded in the prevention of blo@@ od@@ ings in 86 % of the 510 new blood sep@@ sis with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good . &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , he@@ ada@@ ches , Py@@ re@@ xy ( f@@ ever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ance may not be used in patients who may possibly be vulnerable ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster@@ y or one of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission adopted the Ba@@ x@@ ter AG accepts a permit for the sale of Adv@@ ance in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are directed after the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency in accordance with the place and the extent of blood circulation and the clinical state of patient .
at the following hem@@ at@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period does not apply to the given Plas@@ tim@@ pi@@ egel ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .

injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger to the patient is pre@@ matur@@ ely .
&quot; during treatment process , the control of the inj@@ uri@@ al dose and incidence of inj@@ ections is an adequate determination of the factor VIII . &quot;
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII to reach various in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis le@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis of blood proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe har@@ s@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 that is given by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII is not reached or if the blood circulation is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove a in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inflation values , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures need to be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the return speed should be directed after the con@@ quer@@ or of the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exc@@ eeded . &quot;
the formation of neutral antibodies against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with h@@ amm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhi@@ bit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII into Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins which are in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plasma via modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say quanti@@ fied .

&quot; based on the data processing of the data processing , the CH@@ MP has been rated as positive as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the regulatory authorities should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited Edition of the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) officially approved that the company can withdraw its application for approval of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the chest , the brain , the bones , or the soft@@ parts ( tissues , the other structures in the body combines , surrounds and base ) of it . &quot;
&quot; this is a kind of virus that gene@@ tically modified , that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; at the virus in Adv@@ ance , it is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which has changed so that there cannot be copies of itself and can thus trigger no infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ance would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again . &quot;
the p@@ 53 protein that is formed from which not def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene is usually contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to the death of cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company laid data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the under@@ mining , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had the answers of the company to the questions asked questions , there were still some questions uns@@ ol@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP mark on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
after the CH@@ MP opinion has not been sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ance in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ore offers benefits for the patient .
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medication by means of the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not proven sufficient that Adv@@ ance can be established in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company was not aware of the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; compilation &quot; Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; changed active ingre@@ dient , means that the tablets are so coll@@ ap@@ sed that one of the effective ingredients is immediately un@@ released and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y @-@ plate ) used by a allergy against p@@ ollen in patients with Rhin@@ oplast@@ y ( hidden nose ) .
for adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents from 12 years the recommended dose of Aer@@ ina@@ ze is to be taken every day a tablet which should be taken up with a glass of water with or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can im@@ itate upon the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; the main active dimensions were the changes in the heav@@ ing of ha@@ y symptoms , which were reported by patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the study the patients suffered their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary , and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala , how heavy the symptoms in the last 12 hours were . &quot;
&quot; considering all the ha@@ y symp@@ tom symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients who took the aer@@ os@@ ze , over a decrease of symptoms around 46.@@ 0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients , the pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients among Aer@@ ators showed a reduction of symptoms around 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ os@@ ze ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( cardi@@ tis ) , gl@@ uc@@ gi@@ li@@ tis ( re@@ peti@@ tive ) , cl@@ or@@ ex@@ y , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ om@@ ze may not be used in patients who may possibly be vulnerable ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ep@@ in@@ ep@@ in@@ tox@@ ins or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not used . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ om@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ angle glau@@ coma ( increased water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) or a hem@@ ian stroke ( through a brain @-@ hem@@ ian stroke ) or have a risk to an hem@@ orrho@@ id stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission announced the European Commission of SP Europe a permit for the discharge of aer@@ om@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them break , break or sli@@ ce ) . &quot;
aer@@ os@@ ze should not be applied due to the mis@@ conception of data to im@@ mortality and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after dis@@ appearance the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use of use at 10 days , as in long @-@ term use the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time can decrease . &quot;
the decrease in the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous cells in the upper respir@@ ation can be continued when needed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as Mon@@ otherapy .
&quot; since Aer@@ ky pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated in patients suffering from with a mon@@ o@@ unding oxida@@ se ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tical activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , per@@ go@@ lid , vin@@ eg@@ olin , ra@@ hydro@@ ge@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , al@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
security and the effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient therapy and the data are not enough to trigger corresponding recommendations to dosage .
security and effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver distur@@ b@@ ance and the data are not enough to trigger corresponding recommendations to dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about the treatment at the appearance of a hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or t@@ ach@@ y@@ les , cardi@@ ac disease , nau@@ sea or et@@ w@@ ai@@ gen other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as he@@ ada@@ che or a strengthening of the he@@ ada@@ che ) . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , the patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ ms • patients with hyper@@ tension in patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ary in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ina@@ ze is estimated at least 48 hours before carrying dermat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for conc@@ ise transactions or reduce in their scale . &quot;
&quot; as part of clinical tests with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol have additionally been administ@@ ered , however , were not observed any clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
in the results of the psych@@ ic tests could not be significant differences between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and those with plac@@ ebo treated patients regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was taken alone or with alcohol .
that for the met@@ abolic ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzy@@ mes was not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely .
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is not inhi@@ bited in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a substr@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one . &quot;
the im@@ mortality of the use of Aer@@ ina@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured to experience experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies but does not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the incidence of normal population .
&quot; as re@@ production studies of animals are not always transferred to human beings , and on the basis of vas@@ o@@ on@@ stri@@ kt@@ or@@ ical properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied in a very rare cases to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic noise or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS Depression ( Se@@ dation , Ap@@ pe@@ e , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , comm@@ a , heart cycle coll@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , staircase , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ als . &quot;

&quot; a z@@ NS stimulation is particularly probably , as also as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth drying , p@@ up@@ wa@@ ist and - di@@ lat@@ ation , conc@@ ession , hyper@@ therm@@ ia and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of the infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ c@@ ine like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Ma@@ st@@ C@@ s / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es one as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hem@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ Sel@@ ective cells . &quot;
&quot; when a single dose study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective hose , or the tasks that are connected to the finger . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials was no increased intake of 5 mg every day in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can produce further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tical effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years were attended with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amin@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ om@@ ze tablets , determined by the total core for the symp@@ tom ( except nas@@ al skin sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine about the 2 @-@ week period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ om@@ ze tablets with regard to the dimin@@ ishing effect is determined higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin on the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation defined patient groups . &quot;
as part of a single dose study for Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ ina@@ ze is Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ om@@ ze at healthy eating over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has reached 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in day 10 .
&quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ ing , which has been carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy grown propor@@ tions , was established that four Pro@@ b@@ anden Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are poor@@ ly dependent . &quot;
a component @-@ level study indicates that the Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after al@@ some gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ equi@@ valence was to Ex@@ pos@@ ure of a aer@@ om@@ is@@ o tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity in repeat@@ able gift , to the gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and for reproductive @-@ tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin will not recognise any special haz@@ ards for the people . &quot;
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingre@@ dient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .

&quot; in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis triggered when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of symp@@ tom ( symp@@ tom ) by 25 to 32 % in comparison to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symp@@ tom@@ less treatment was compared with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in those with plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who may possibly be vulnerable ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components . &quot;
January 2001 the European Commission published the European Commission of SP Europe adop@@ ts a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .

there are limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness in applying Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous illness and may end after the dis@@ appearance of symptoms and can be resum@@ ed at its re @-@ occur .
the pers@@ ensi@@ tive Rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been tested in the context of clin@@ ician studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets were not listed in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol have additionally been administ@@ ered ( see under section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced by A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the performance of alcohol abuse ( see under section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied in a very rare cases of benefits , which can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic noise or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , considered in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects , about which was more common than in plac@@ ebo were tired@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , m@@ outh@@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and he@@ ada@@ ches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 y@@ outh@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect he@@ ada@@ ches was treated at 5.5 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and around 6.7 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( ninth clinical dose ) were administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ ners of the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals . &quot;
&quot; for a single dos@@ ing study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective hose , or the tasks that are connected to the finger . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z the nose , itch and red@@ ness of the eyes and itch on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , can allergic r@@ hin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of symptoms even in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and pers@@ isti@@ ing allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as a occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ensi@@ tive Rhin@@ itis is defined as a occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
how with the overall volume of the questionn@@ aires in the quality of life in Rhin@@ o gen@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis has been shown dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively emerg@@ es by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria has dep@@ uty investig@@ ating for other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria as the underlying path@@ physiological ge@@ ology has been similar to the mod@@ elling in different forms and can be easier pro@@ spect@@ ated patients easier .
&quot; since the hist@@ amine is a common factor in all urban diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of urine . this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dosage interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients , which is not excluded in anti@@ hist@@ amine , from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and guard , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in an Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics study , which were comparable to the patients &quot; dem@@ ographic r@@ end@@ emic r@@ hin@@ itis population , was achieved with 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ue for a clin@@ ically relevant c@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , for the met@@ abolic ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzy@@ mes yet not yet identified , so interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a substr@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ isti@@ an allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the descrip@@ tive doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years can be caused by infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that no data are available to support a treatment of inf@@ ectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ al@@ ies should be played in the diagnosis the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin investigations . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are met@@ aboli@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and experience higher sub@@ stan@@ tive load ( see under section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ ups in children between 2 and 11 years , the restricted met@@ alli@@ zation , is identical with the children that are normal met@@ aboli@@ ze . &quot;

&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been established within the framework of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol have additionally been administ@@ ered ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not ampli@@ fied by A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the performance effects of alcohol ( see under section 5.1 ) .
the tot@@ ality of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , considered in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study on adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( ninth clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects have been observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years have come to an anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy received by 1,25 mg ( at the age between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children can be similar to the drug data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults on the children &apos;s population .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. to the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) officially approved that the company takes its application for approval by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied to adults and older people to protect the flu , which will be applied by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine that could cause a future p@@ and@@ emic , which is intended to protect a future p@@ and@@ emic . &quot;
&quot; a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ and@@ em@@ ie breaks out , when a new tribe of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus emerg@@ es to spread easily from humans , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine the immune system det@@ ects the immune system the parts of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus as &quot; &quot; physical &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
thus the immune system later is able to form in contact with a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus this pedi@@ gree faster si@@ RNA .
&quot; subsequently the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface which recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ alien ) and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; &quot; Good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
thus the scale of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine would not consist in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA &apos;s guidelines for pre@@ m@@ and@@ emic vacc@@ ines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment , please feel free to contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information about the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is being applied in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which is caused by human immun@@ ity virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which are the acquired quired Immun@@ e De@@ fic@@ iency ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , stands also as a solution for inser@@ tion , but these can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be pris@@ oned when the doctor has tested , which anti @-@ vir@@ al medicines of the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood judged that the virus is to speak to the medicine . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily which can be taken together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is governed by body weight .
A@@ gener@@ asis decreases with intake in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al drugs the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS not to heal , however , the damage of the immune system and thus the development of AIDS related infections and diseases delay . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were examined in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which had previously been treated with prot@@ esters . &quot;
this with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had formerly been used to be used by other proteins .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ veri@@ fi@@ able concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in the vir@@ al last after the treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prototype , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a Vir@@ us@@ last less than 400 copies / ml than in plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children decreased arom@@ a@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ al load , although some of the children had been treated earlier with prot@@ esters , only very few on the treatment languages . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , which had been treated earlier with prot@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other proteins : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was against four other proteins resistant to four weeks , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste from Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as with the patients who took their previous prototype : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ ches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Ill@@ nesses ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may possibly be vulnerable ( allergic ) against am@@ o@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ic may also not be used in patients with cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or drugs , which are just as arom@@ ase , and are in high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health harmful . &quot;
&quot; as in other medicines for HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ic drugs have to take the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( symptoms of an infection which will be caused by the increased immune system ) . &quot;
the committee for human medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ic drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee presented that the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prototype , not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission announced the European Commission of Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for the consumption of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected versions ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administ@@ ered to the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting by Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r should be carried out in consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance @-@ pattern and the treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the entry is 14 % lower than by Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of amp@@ ou@@ fl@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fy addi@@ tive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , must be applied higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r that should not be exc@@ eeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data to im@@ mortality and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ opo@@ eia , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be done in patients with mild or moderate hep@@ atitis , in case of patients with severe hep@@ atic disorder , it is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also a substr@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) contain , may not be applied due to the risk reduction of reduced plasma cent@@ ri@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ ist infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are supposed to be applied with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy did have a increased risk for heavy liver impacts with potentially deadly disease .
&quot; for the event of simultaneous anti@@ vir@@ al treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the specialized information of these medicines . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chronic hep@@ atitis are an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to the clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other gl@@ uc@@ tion@@ ists , which will be confused via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended that the potential benefits of treating the risk of system@@ ic corro@@ sive effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ dep@@ ended and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ aline function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
since the met@@ ering of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Redu@@ kt@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ mer Lov@@ em@@ atin and Sim@@ il@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is an simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ ult@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
&quot; 4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation ratio ) , are methods for determination of the active concentration . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective due to reduced Plas@@ tim@@ pi@@ egel of Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r . ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrast can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , patients therefore should be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ance symp@@ tom symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ ou@@ se@@ al@@ ts of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inv@@ itations , this formulation is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated with children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be divided into duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the vei@@ ls are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in case of patients who were an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ ector inhi@@ bit@@ ors , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ tion@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had different diseases related to their treatment drugs that were associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; for domestic aid patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ esters , reports of an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous k@@ ut@@ aner hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sen . &quot;
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ity can develop an infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opport@@ un@@ ist infections that leads to heavy clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial ether is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , were reported cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also a substr@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ates with lower therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be changed together with pharmaceuticals whose ingredients are primarily associated with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for the increased plasma cutting with he@@ avier and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r causes , which can lead to an vi@@ rolog@@ y failure and lead to an resistance development . &quot;
&quot; at the trial , the lowest Plas@@ tim@@ pi@@ egel is observed by a dosage of other protein inhi@@ bit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ ber of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r can be s@@ lower by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient is already crow@@ ned by Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , the Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r@@ spiegel and , if possible , the vir@@ al load to review and the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max on the other by 30 % lower , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , Do@@ si@@ eves were applied twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , applying the effectiveness and im@@ mortality of this treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
52 % lower if Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained during the combination of Am@@ per@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a daily basis . &quot;
&quot; a dosage intake for the simultaneous administration of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there will be a narrow surveillance , since the effectiveness and im@@ mortality of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart . ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ esters would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other types of protein and existing limited data are susp@@ ected that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ into the ser@@ ver@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r may sen@@ sed .
&quot; if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din because of the reduced or perhaps sub@@ therapeutic plastic mask could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough analysis of clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise predic@@ ting of the effect of combining am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din . &quot;
the simultaneous gri@@ pping of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to a rise in with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin side effects .
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ asis will be administ@@ ered to a reduction in dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , though no clinical data are available . &quot;
&quot; Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , however , the Plas@@ tim@@ pi@@ egel of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ pin ) compared to the value that has been observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below , including substr@@ ates , inhi@@ bit@@ or or indu@@ ction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions , which are associated with these drugs , in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other proteins , it is advisable that Ant@@ azi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can be res@@ or@@ atory disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va , which are known as enzy@@ min@@ du@@ kt@@ ors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma seal of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

&quot; the simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ic may increase their plasma cent@@ ric levels , and reinforce with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in connection with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ ting , t@@ end@@ ure and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % reduction of 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous G@@ ot of A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these gl@@ uc@@ tion@@ ists who is not recommended that the potential benefits of treating the risk of system@@ ic corro@@ sive effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Redu@@ kt@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ m@@ ics such as Lov@@ em@@ atin and Sim@@ il@@ atin that is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced enh@@ ancements of Plas@@ tim@@ pi@@ egel in simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel@@ increases with this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduction of my@@ opath@@ y , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ se , the combined application of these medicines will not be recommended using Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it will be a pre@@ valent monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations up to stabil@@ isation of the mirror , since the plasma concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ tic@@ li@@ m can be increased ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ic may not be used together with oral in@@ gested Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while being offered with par@@ ax@@ ial Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein release notes on a possible increase in plasma seal from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 @-@ fold .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ fl@@ avi@@ r , patients therefore should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ance symp@@ tom symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; due to the lower neg@@ ligence of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to be given as the am@@ o@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose , if Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gri@@ pping of War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ial antibodies together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a strengthened control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ als Ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ al effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ table so alternative methods for conception is recommended .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended by both A@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be applied after pregnancy only after careful inspection of the possible farm for the mother compared to the potential risks for fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk l@@ ati@@ le rats , am@@ o@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r passes to men into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a re @-@ production of imp@@ air@@ ments which was administ@@ ered by the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us up to the end of the stagn@@ ation of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r during the lac@@ tation period showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy .
the further development of account@@ ability including fer@@ til@@ isation and re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r to the wom@@ b .
the im@@ mortality of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment side effects were slightly up to moderate , they entered early and led rarely to treatment . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or if they are a result of atro@@ cities . &quot;
&quot; most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which with prot@@ ector number , patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase occurred twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were employed by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study media , and at more than 1 % of patients were performed , and under the treatment of elaborate laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al Com@@ bination therapy has been associated with an re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including loss of periph@@ eral and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ hic of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal li@@ pos@@ ing . &quot;
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al do not pre @-@ treated people who were treated with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ ine about a medium duration of 36 weeks was only observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .

&quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose have been reported in particular in patients with general known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ity can be developed at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opport@@ un@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; treated with PI @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 3 and 4 ) which were observed in patients with low @-@ gener@@ ic Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently applied . &quot;

the anti@@ vir@@ al activity of Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in ac@@ ut and chronic inf@@ alli@@ tic cell@@ ular lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as on periph@@ eral blood vessels . &quot;
the 50 % of Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in ac@@ ut infected cells and amounts to three µm in chronic cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of the HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication on people is not yet defined .
&quot; during the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al , patients with the currently approved fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages were used - like with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ oo@@ ster@@ ols - the mut@@ ations used only rarely observed . &quot;

&quot; an initial analysis of the ins@@ ulin analysis of 13 of 14 children , where a vi@@ rolog@@ y failure did not appear in the 59 included , with prot@@ esters did not pre @-@ treated patients , showed resistance mu@@ ster that were similar to those with adults . &quot;

the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations are subject to change due to additional data and it is advised to move up the current interpre@@ tations systems to analyse the results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ otyp@@ ic resistance of clinical analysis systems can be used in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ation of the activity of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for patients with prot@@ ector @-@ resistant isolation .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phenomen@@ al cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ der ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be applied to the interpretation of outcomes of an resistance tests .
&quot; each of these four with reduced sensitivity to Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r Associ@@ ated genetic model creates a certain Crus@@ her against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r , but generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there is currently data to cross @-@ resistant between am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and other protein numbers for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of five and@@ twenty anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al , non @-@ treated patients in which a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isolation ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulin ) , in@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ulates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ulates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ o@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant isolation in the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and the type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isolation . &quot;
&quot; the early dis@@ ruption of a reconc@@ iling therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which can affect the following treatment . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open trial ( Vir@@ us@@ last ≥ 1000 copies twice daily ) and Nu@@ kl@@ e@@ osi@@ dan@@ al@@ oga ( NT@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with a lower ritual &quot; &quot; oo@@ st@@ ert &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; six@@ ty @-@ three @-@ six@@ ty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with a proven virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ subj@@ ection of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the So@@ C @-@ PI Group in the connection to the time @-@ violence ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ subject area of 0.@@ 4 log@@ ten copies / ml .
the cover of the effectiveness of im@@ br@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients receive 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it was given no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients with PI @-@ treated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the patients together with A@@ gener@@ ase , NR@@ TI@@ s . &quot;
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included a Plasma HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with an medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count from 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the starting value . &quot;
19 Basi@@ cs to this data should be considered with PI @-@ optimised children of the expected benefits of &quot; uns@@ ast@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
after oral administration the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to maximum Ser@@ um concentration of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
&quot; 5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max. at about 30 % reduced , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered . &quot;
administration of Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % of the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake and the rate of the res@@ or@@ ption remained . &quot;
the seem@@ ing volume capacity is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and is adjustable to a large distribution volume and an enormous penetration of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r from the blo@@ od@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ occupied Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; during the absolute concentration of un@@ bent am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r constant , the percentage of the free active component in the ste@@ el@@ ation period in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore medicines must indu@@ ce drug or inhi@@ bits or a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ o@@ avi@@ r @-@ exposure such as adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ able than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ mar basis .
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r negl@@ ected , therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low to the elimination of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment units lead to am@@ o@@ avi@@ r @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ eg@@ ulas comparable those that can be obtained from healthy propor@@ tionally after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on can@@ cer@@ y with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r an mice and rats stood at doses of male animals , hep@@ at@@ ea hep@@ at@@ rop@@ es in dos@@ ages ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , entsp@@ ils . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ cell aden@@ oma and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for man is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , resulting from clinical studies as well as from therapeu@@ tical application , however , however little notes for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity tests , the bacterial @-@ lymph@@ oma testing ( am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ sc@@ test of rats and chro@@ mos@@ en@@ su@@ pre@@ y @-@ leg@@ ged , was am@@ ass@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ ious . &quot;
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measurement of A@@ ST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ase . &quot;
&quot; so far in clinical studies have not observed yet significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during the administration of arom@@ ases nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles who were treated at an age of 4 days both at the check@@ ers and with the Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals a high mortality .
&quot; in a system@@ ic plasma exposure , the significant under ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected ex@@ position under therapeutic dosage , however , were observed a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and lower sk@@ elet@@ on changes that refer to a hes@@ it@@ ated development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fy addi@@ tive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , must be applied higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r that should not be exc@@ eeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is intended to be treated in patients with watch@@ ful or lighter hep@@ atitis with caution in case of patients with severe liver mal@@ functions it is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; 26 For some medicinal drugs can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation ratio ) , are methods for determination of the active concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on length 27 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the vei@@ ling are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r causes , which can lead to an vi@@ rolog@@ y failure and lead to an resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max on the other by 30 % lower , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained during the combination of Am@@ per@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a daily basis . &quot;
&quot; a dosage intake for the simultaneous administration of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there will be a narrow surveillance , since the effectiveness and im@@ mortality of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ esters would be low .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough analysis of clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise predic@@ ting of the effect of combining am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din . &quot;
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ asis will be administ@@ ered to a reduction in dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data . &quot;

&quot; with simultaneous gri@@ pping of War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ial antibodies together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a strengthened control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ als Ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ al effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ es@@ tradi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r by 22 % bz@@ w .

the anti@@ vir@@ al activity of Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in ac@@ ut and chronic inf@@ alli@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blo@@ od@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % of Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in ac@@ ut infected cells and amounts to three µm in chronic cells ( 1 µm = 0,50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ o@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant isolation in the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and the type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isolation . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the treatment should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children to the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ bent &quot; &quot; v@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; during the absolute concentration of un@@ bent am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r constant , the percentage of the free active component in the ste@@ el@@ ation period in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore medicines must indu@@ ce drug or inhi@@ bits or a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r negl@@ ected ; therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the can@@ cer@@ y with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r an mice and rats stood in doses of male animals , hep@@ at@@ oms hep@@ at@@ ular aden@@ oma for dos@@ ages ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to man after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the origin of hep@@ at@@ zel@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ oma and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for man is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , resulting from clinical studies as well as from therapeu@@ tical application , however little notes for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity tests , the bacterial @-@ lymph@@ oma testing ( am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ sc@@ test of rats and chro@@ mos@@ en@@ cro@@ pped @-@ leg@@ ged , was am@@ ass@@ avi@@ r or s@@ oto@@ x@@ ious . &quot;
studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles who were treated at an age of 4 days both at the check@@ ers and with the Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals a high mortality .
&quot; these results can conclude that in juven@@ iles the met@@ abolic systems are not fully mature , so Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase solution to the inser@@ tion is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected versions ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; ast@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to the entry was neither taken with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the entry is 14 % lower than by Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with the intake of the solution to the inser@@ ting ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicinal drugs up to a daily dose of 2800 mg Am@@ inn@@ avi@@ r that should not be exc@@ eeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; additionally , since no dosage intake for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided to avoid this combination with these patients . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for am@@ o@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for use , is an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ geh@@ al@@ ts , A@@ gener@@ ic solution for inv@@ itations in to@@ dd@@ lers and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , with patients with reduced liver function or liver bl@@ ends and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration may lead to a com@@ peti@@ tive in@@ hibition of the met@@ abolic ization of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ m@@ ia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ ist infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation ratio ) , are methods for determination of the active concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be adjusted to long when a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the vei@@ ls are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; for domestic aid patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ esters , reports of an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous k@@ ut@@ aner hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sen . &quot;

the im@@ mortality of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
&quot; with many of these events is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or if they are a result of atro@@ cities . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al , patients with the currently approved fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages were used - like with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ oo@@ ster@@ ols - the mut@@ ations used only rarely observed . &quot;

in 3 non @-@ ass@@ uring the relevant phase 3 effic@@ acy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete cooling of the fet@@ ters in an im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
&quot; at 60 % of the total of 119 with Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od , patients incur@@ red completely off ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo therapy in the case ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
a complete cooling could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od @-@ treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of im@@ i@@ i@@ od@@ ine for five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ fl@@ acons , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target @-@ tum@@ ors were hist@@ ological confirmed individual primary super@@ flu@@ ous bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; those from an open , un@@ controlled @-@ long @-@ term study after four years of this data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this was also 48 months long . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of im@@ i@@ od@@ ine at three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment period , was examined in two double @-@ blin@@ ked , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ tro@@ l@@ filed clinical studies . &quot;

the single @-@ year data from two combined ob@@ structions studies show patients with clin@@ ing cooling down after one or two treatment periods a reaction rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications of external f@@ eig@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ ic Bas@@ al@@ cell@@ om occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients usually not up and were therefore not examined . &quot;

the effectiveness of Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od could not be shown in these studies where dos@@ ages were not shown ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal system@@ ic recording of the 5 % hem@@ i@@ od@@ ine cre@@ ams by the skin of 58 patients with acoustic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during three weeks of weekly application during 16 weeks .

the calculated @-@ obvious half @-@ day period was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ th half @-@ value after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; that points to a prolon@@ ged re@@ tention of the medication by means of the skin .
the data for system@@ ic exposure shown that the res@@ or@@ ption of im@@ i@@ i@@ od@@ ine intended for top@@ ical application of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable with healthy adults and adults with an acoustic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .

a two @-@ year trial for car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at three days per week in@@ duced no tum@@ ors at the use point .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od is only a low systematic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ation , is a risk to man due to the system@@ ic ex@@ position as very low . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug has been tested , however , it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by pursu@@ ing its effect with regard to reducing the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) . &quot;
in children under five years Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine around 60 % and half of the treated children pointed out a normal great liver at the end of the study .
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me at patients aged over 5 years ( be observed if more than 1 of 10 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ ches , skin he@@ ada@@ ches , skin pain , pain relief , pain in the li@@ mbs ( in hands and feet ) , Hit@@ z@@ eg@@ e@@ zer , f@@ ever and reactions to the inf@@ usion place . &quot;

the treatment with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who owns experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ edit@@ ary met@@ abolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can if the patient can toler@@ ate this every 15 minutes in single steps on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me for adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended any dos@@ ing scheme . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be determined in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency , and for these patients may not be recommended any dos@@ ing scheme . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me patients may develop inf@@ usion conditional reactions , which are defined as any related side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of inf@@ usion ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored closer to these patients , and the inf@@ usion of al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment , in the re@@ vit@@ alization equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ oni@@ da@@ se , usually within 3 months from treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients , the antibodies or symptoms of a inf@@ usion conditional reaction must be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , must be cau@@ tious due to the theoretically increased risk @-@ reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tica ) to treat the potential appearance @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of an easy or moderate @-@ related reaction , the treatment should be associated with anti @-@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction in inf@@ usion rate at half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of single , heavy inf@@ usion conditional reaction must be stopped until the symptoms are brought into decline , treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to consider . &quot;
&quot; inf@@ usion can be recorded with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate , when the reaction occurred , will be resum@@ ed again . &quot;
3 are used ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate in which the pres@@ enters reaction is performed .
&quot; Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with the intr@@ insi@@ ell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ oni@@ da@@ se . &quot;
&quot; veterinary studies do not leave a direct or indirect impact on the pregnancy , the embryonic development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns were exp@@ elled from Lar@@ oni@@ da@@ se over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during the treatment with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me not to bre@@ ast@@ feeding . &quot;
side effects in clinical trials were arranged primarily as inf@@ usion conditional reactions that were observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 @-@ study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drug transactions associated with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me who were observed during phase @-@ 3 study or older at a total duration of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment of treatment : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ conditional participation of the upper respir@@ atory and lungs in the history , in addition , severe reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing , and face @-@ face ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ solic@@ itation effects in connection with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study involving 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predomin@@ antly heavy duty form and treatment duration up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 e / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients came to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version within 3 months after the start of treatment , whereby at the age of 5 with a he@@ avier break @-@ shape usually within one month to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version ( average of 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;

&quot; patients with failure to lower antibodies to a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ale until low @-@ neutral inhi@@ bit@@ al effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ oni@@ da@@ se@@ - activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to not affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted drug transactions , even if the occurrence of unwanted drug actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the grounds for the enzy@@ mes is located in one of the hydro@@ lys@@ is of the accum@@ ulated substr@@ ate and the prevention of a further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzy@@ mes .
&quot; after in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ oni@@ da@@ se is rapidly taken out of the circulation and cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me have been tested in random@@ ized , double @-@ blin@@ ked , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ tro@@ l@@ aved phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the entire disease spectrum was reported , the majority of patients were seen from the middle phenomenon and only one patient proved to be the heavy balance . &quot;
patients were cur@@ ated if they had a for@@ c@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change to be expected to be expected to be expected in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ en- .
all patients were subsequently cur@@ ated for an open label extension where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the plac@@ ebo group , an improvement in the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and the en@@ vi@@ ability that is shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ group and from 182 weeks in plac@@ ebo / Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me group as from the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ y @-@ volume increases further proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study had a normal liver size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established until the end of the course was constant .
&quot; in regard to the hetero@@ gene@@ ous illness of illness between patients , characterized by using a combined end@@ point variable , the clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute walk , movement of the school @-@ span AH@@ I and Seh@@ shar@@ fe ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was carried out a one @-@ year open phase 2 study conducted in which primarily the security and Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their recording to study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe de@@ bit form and 4 with middle circulation ) . &quot;
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased g@@ AG@@ - mirror in the har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) has been determined after the Z @-@ Score for these age group The younger patients with heavy wear @-@ form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with heavy duty cycle form a normal spiritual evol@@ ving form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with heavy wear @-@ shape are limited limited or even no progress in cog@@ nitive development .
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic impacts of different al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ sation schem@@ ata were conducted at the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 e / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks can be with patients , the difficulties with weekly information ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses are equal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate each new information , which will be available annually , and if required , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who had previously been treated yet , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and with patients who have previously used other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than usual therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take care of vitamin B@@ 12 patients during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered with cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be used before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( medicines for fatigue ) and liquids ( to bend a liquid @-@ gel ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be raised , dis@@ set or the dose decreases . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus demanded the formation of DNA and RNA and prevent the cells to share .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of medication by means of a longer active period of cancer cells . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was examined for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Pl@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms A@@ lim@@ ta studied in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received any chemotherapy against their disease .
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ national lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other medicines for cancer ) . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin were treated at an average of 12,@@ 1 month , compared to 9,@@ 3 months in general administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received an chemotherapy , was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7,@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies there are patients suffering in which cancer is not the turn@@ able cells . in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission of the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ derland B.@@ V. has been appro@@ ached by A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
every diar@@ rhe@@ a bottle has to be re@@ activated with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % low so@@ dium solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .

the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) extends as in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .

&quot; the reduction of the frequency and sever@@ ity of door@@ step must be given on the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ G@@ abe , as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ id . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid , and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy of therapy and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also get an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) during the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third party cycle .
&quot; in case of patients , the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Set , should be created before every gift of a complete blood @-@ image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a rom@@ atic cy@@ linders . &quot;
the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ing tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( A@@ ST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limits . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dosage is necessary to take place under Ber@@ rec@@ ess of blood cells or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predic@@ tive therapy cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , suitable for ALI@@ M@@ TA than Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 blo@@ cking .
&quot; should patients non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity decreased by degree 3 ( except neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient is worth the value before the treatment &quot;
&quot; the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be abandoned , if in case of patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ cent tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 appearance or so@@ - continue at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity . &quot;
clinical studies had no indication that in patients at the age of 65 but compared to patients at the age of 65 is a increased by @-@ effective epi@@ th@@ us@@ - ko .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data for im@@ mortality and effectiveness .
clinical trials were in@@ compatible with patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adap@@ tations that go beyond for all patients recommended Dos@@ is@@ sions .
the data base for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver functioning of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Limit and / or transc@@ end@@ ental value of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ digit of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metastatic ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ in of the upper limits ( in the presence of liver metastatic ) , not specifically studied in studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mineral soup and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ p@@ ite will again have a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the rom@@ atic cy@@ tes can be reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ p@@ ite number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ants and maximum non @-@ hem@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the preceding treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non@@ th@@ es@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity such as Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie has been be@@ amed if a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be reli@@ ed with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ esi@@ ed measure for reduction @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium @-@ in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) need to avoid the simultaneous in@@ ster@@ oi@@ dal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ set ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , provided for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long semi @-@ value for at least 5 days before therapy , at the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events appeared , appropriate risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existence hyper@@ tension or Diabetes . &quot;
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid - accumulation in the trans@@ cell@@ ular space a drain in the trans@@ cell@@ ular space will be er@@ ated in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ary , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this drug is usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ical active ingre@@ dient . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ sted life @-@ vacc@@ ines ( except v@@ b@@ f@@ ever , this vacc@@ ination is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible cran@@ ial adjustment of reproductive @-@ ability by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be noted above the treatment of treatment , advice regarding the sperm conservation . &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can lead high doses non @-@ ster@@ oi@@ dal Anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ ms &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,@@ 3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of a multip@@ lication of side effects . &quot;
therefore caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses from N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dosage .
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ set - TEN@@ S 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data in terms of interaction potential than Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the ger@@ inn@@ acle status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between or@@ inal anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patients with or@@ al anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as at an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ et@@ ol@@ ites are expected to be expected in pregnant heavy goods . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be used during pregnancy , except if absolutely extraordinary and after careful handling of the farm for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible cran@@ ial of reproductive @-@ ability by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment of treatment , advice regarding the sperm vie@@ to . &quot;

&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss entered into the first 6 months . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is applied in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and om@@ iting are ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and om@@ iting are ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be used by the additional gift of a Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as the effects in this age group is not enough information .
&quot; this means that the effectiveness of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ onin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chemical therapy received , which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are , 59 % of patients , which were treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron for patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are , shown 81 % of patients , which were treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron for patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
when compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values are 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission announced the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd .
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ ces : to prevent mal@@ nour@@ ishment and v@@ om@@ iting chemotherapy due to cancer disease and to the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi regarding the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is in@@ duced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding one before chemotherapy given by chemotherapy . &quot;
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the Dick@@ dar@@ mp@@ ass@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ contrac@@ tor I@@ le@@ us after the injection @-@ ma@@ Shi@@ p . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable to extend the Q@@ T @-@ Inter@@ v@@ all or for patients in which the Q@@ t- interval is prolon@@ ged or which tend to be an extension . &quot;
&quot; except related to another chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi should neither be used in the days after chemotherapy or to treat nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials inhi@@ bited Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron against tum@@ ors the activity of the five studied chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tic does not ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amid , Cy@@ cli@@ ab@@ in , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration or@@ nam@@ ental Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , one CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in one of a population @-@ based pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gri@@ pping of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ du@@ kt@@ or@@ os ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , San@@ ox@@ i@@ dol , ox@@ ic@@ e@@ tin , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ inated and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron for human pregn@@ ancies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is necessary from the patient doctor as necessary . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observ@@ ant side effects ( total 633 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi related to Alo@@ xi ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions on administration ( burning , failure , complaints and pain@@ s ) were stated in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage demonstrated similar pre@@ valence of unwanted events like in other doses ; there were no dose @-@ effic@@ acy relations .
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies performed , due to the great distribution volumes , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy in an al@@ x@@ irs . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized dual @-@ blind studies were given a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ated chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ id ( half value of 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7,@@ 3 hours ) , which was given to day 1 without dex@@ ame@@ th@@ ason in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized twin @-@ fo@@ als of 667 patients were given a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to the 32 mg of on@@ set@@ ron that were given to day 1 in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous . &quot;
the results of the studies with moder@@ em@@ eto@@ er chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ er chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indications of chemotherapy @-@ in@@ duced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to blo@@ cking on the v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation of participating iter@@ ations and to extend the duration of the potential potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy mascul@@ inity , the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single d@@ osis of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After in@@ trav@@ en@@ ös@@ er G@@ abe follows an initial acceptance of the plasma cent@@ ri@@ ations a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ alen half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C0@@ - ) are generally in the whole dosage range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg at ges@@ tures and cancer patients .
after in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous G@@ abe of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was the average of 11 Ho@@ den@@ kar@@ st medium ( ± SD ) rise in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations emerg@@ es that at once daily in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous G@@ abe of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron of 3 consecutive days reached total amount of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the sale of 0.75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % will be eliminated about the kid@@ neys , and some more 50 % will be converted into two primary metals , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for Met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in the lower dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After an in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous single dose of 10 Micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron of approximately 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a unique in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous Bol@@ usin@@ injection in ges@@ oun@@ ds the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although patients with severe liver func@@ tionally increases the termin@@ ale elimination of elimination with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction in dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , effects were observed only by ex@@ positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for the clinical use . &quot;
10 of pre@@ clinical trials examine that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only be involved in very high concentr@@ ations of iter@@ ations and repression in the v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded over two years ago , led to a multi @-@ prolon@@ ged frequency of liver li@@ mbs , end@@ ophysi@@ se , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , per@@ su@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin @-@ tum@@ ors , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application , the relevance of these results is low . &quot;

June 2006 adopted the committee for human medicines ( CH@@ MP ) has been a negative expertise in which the approval of authorisation for the handling of hep@@ atitis C aged by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ections recommended .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same cells as an effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long an@@ hal@@ atory ) hep@@ atitis C ( one caused by a virus infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue damage , the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ ms Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increased in the blood standard . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the active ingredients .
&quot; the makers of Al@@ ph@@ eon put data in front of the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredients , composition and purity of the drug , mode , safety and effectiveness in hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on patients with hep@@ atitis C , the effectiveness of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 455 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study was measured , how many patients were after 12 from a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the medication ( i.e. , no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed concerns that the data for the stability of the drug and the market @-@ market@@ able drug has not been sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , which resulted in the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ers the disease in more patients more than at the reference cells . moreover Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
&quot; apart from that , the test has been inserted in the study for exam@@ ining the question , in@@ definitely the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ body - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cru@@ ising awareness ) and small inver@@ ted la@@ under@@ ations ( cr@@ acking , or cutting @-@ w@@ oun@@ ds ) , cre@@ ases and se@@ wn w@@ oun@@ ds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go is not supposed to be used for the treatment of infections that were veri@@ fi@@ able or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ized resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against this sort of infections could not affect .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient speaks for two or three days not on the treatment , the physician should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by block@@ ade of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the effic@@ acy was in all five studies of the percentage of patients whose infection declined after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke on the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected parts , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ efal@@ exin similar to rates : if the results of both studies have been considered in front @-@ parts , they spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused in the treatment of aby@@ ss ( the filling hol@@ lowed in the body tissue ) or of infections that were subsequently caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a maturity in the order .
&quot; the committee for human cells ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the spa @-@ treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections towards the risks over@@ balance : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , s@@ ay@@ es or gen@@ dar@@ ed w@@ oun@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; May 2007 , the European Commission announced the European Commission of Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients in which two or three days are not likely to be examined once more and an alternative therapy is to be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of raising awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ads , the treatment should be cancelled carefully and an adequate alternative therapy for infection . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections , where MR@@ SA is known as Er@@ re@@ ger or susp@@ ected ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with secondary @-@ infected wound , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no recovery or deterioration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the small plastic centr@@ ations , which were achieved by humans according to top@@ ical use on the di@@ ced skin or infected super@@ ficial w@@ oun@@ ds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhi@@ bit@@ ing in vi@@ vo not to expect ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous gri@@ pping of 2 @-@ times 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ads on the di@@ ced skin of healthy grown men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system exposure to top@@ ical applications in patients will not be held dos@@ is@@ sions not required , if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ or is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ production shock according to or@@ inal intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic . &quot;
&quot; when deciding whether the bre@@ ast@@ feeding continues / ended or therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , should be termin@@ ated between the benefit of bre@@ ast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was used , the most frequently reported tribut@@ ary irrit@@ ation at the appointment of about 1 % of patients concerned . &quot;
&quot; mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is ins@@ ulated by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the Anti @-@ Mechan@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on sel@@ ective inhi@@ bit@@ al protein synthesis by interaction at a particular bond of the bacterial cells of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting of anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the bonds of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ental P bonds and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ centre .
&quot; by binding on this conn@@ ect@@ edness hem@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block partial P bonds and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub @-@ units . &quot;
&quot; should be based on the basis of local pre@@ valence of resistance to the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some Inf@@ ection forms , a consultation should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ulin or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in were . &quot;
&quot; in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes should be considered with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was brought 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ads daily under Oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and sh@@ iel@@ ding skin for up to 7 days .

&quot; the holder of approval for the permit has to ensure that an Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ anz@@ system is present , as in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application ( version 6.1 ) and works before the product is mark@@ eted and as long as the product will be applied . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the permit is obliged to perform detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ anz@@ plan , as described in the Version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( RMP ) , as well as any additional updates of the application that will be agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; &quot; guidel@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal products for human use , &quot; the updated target will be submitted at the same time with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that apply the liver ) with children aged between one and 15 years that have not been immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of one of two doses existing vacc@@ ines whereby one protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ ization is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is ensured that the vacc@@ ination can be held at the end of two doses . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose against hep@@ atitis A or B is desired can Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis or -@@ B vaccine .
vacc@@ ines have to act by raising the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) as it can be against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; stran@@ gers &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and the vaccine has been approved since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administ@@ ered within a three doses of existing vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults , even as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effic@@ acy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a month after the last injection of antibodies . &quot;
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine has been compared to an six@@ teen @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led children between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection of antibodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar between inj@@ ections and a 12 @-@ month gap between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed during more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are he@@ ada@@ che , appeti@@ te lack , pain at the inj@@ ecting place , red@@ ness , Mat@@ ity ( fatigue ) as well as maturity . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be re@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients to form one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 announced the European Commission to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the sale of ambitions in the whole
the stand@@ ardis@@ ation plan for the Prim@@ ers with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations ; the first dose at the time of choice and the second dose is administ@@ ered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
&quot; if a refres@@ her is required both for hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B , can vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vacc@@ ines or with a Com@@ bination of combination . &quot;
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis with the Com@@ bination @-@ coated anti @-@ hep@@ atitis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and Anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ antibodies are in the same sizes as according to vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ies vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not completely secured , whether immun@@ o@@ eing expert persons who have addressed to a hep@@ atitis C , a refres@@ her cannot be protected as protection , since they are also protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 How in all inj@@ ections should be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ ac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine corresponding options for medical treatment and monitoring always available immediately .
&quot; if a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the stand@@ ardis@@ ation period is recommended with the Com@@ ational units , the 360 ELISA units form@@ ated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface . &quot;
at hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis and persons with distur@@ b@@ ances of the immune system may not be achieved after the Prim@@ ary anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ antibodies so that in these cases the gift of another vacc@@ ines can be required .
since an in@@ tra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular administration in the gl@@ ut@@ eal muscle could lead to a subtle imp@@ ending success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blo@@ od@@ ine dis@@ rup@@ tions , Ambi@@ rix may be sub@@ cut@@ aneous in such cases , since it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift of blood . &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix was administ@@ ered in the second year in the form of a separate inj@@ ector , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ for@@ cing pol@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ ement and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us com@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ r@@ ons ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ onry vaccine has been administ@@ ered , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or in patients with immune def@@ ective must be out of that , possibly no adequate immune response is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial which has been conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , he@@ ada@@ ches and f@@ ever comparable with the frequency which was observed in the former Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ atives vacc@@ ines . &quot;
clinical trials were attribut@@ able to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
&quot; in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combined . &quot;
only exceptions were the higher pre@@ valence of pain and m@@ ity based on a comp@@ uted base per vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix not on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the propor@@ tions compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the prob@@ able after the gift of the 3 @-@ doses of combination . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vaccine cycle 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the Pro@@ b@@ anden , the Ambi@@ rix had administ@@ ered over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the propor@@ tions which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dosage of Com@@ bination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Mat@@ y was compared high ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ cycle at 39,@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ b@@ anden , the Ambi@@ rix received , compared with 36,@@ 2 % in the propor@@ tions which received the 3 @-@ doses of Com@@ bination ) . &quot;
the frequency of distinctive pain@@ s and m@@ ity was low and comparable to the submission of the Com@@ bination of Com@@ mod@@ elling with the 3 @-@ cap vacc@@ ination was observed .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study with 1- 11 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ vacc@@ inated , the occurrence of locom@@ otive actions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable with the 3 @-@ doses combined with 360 ELISA units of hep@@ atitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; however , at the 6@@ - until 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination by Ambi@@ rix was a frequent appearance of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the share of Im@@ medi@@ ingen , which reported on serious side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ines with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ in@@ for@@ ated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis , was statisti@@ cally not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , which have been carried out in clinical studies at the age of 1 to 15 , including 15 @-@ H@@ AV 99@@ ,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the serv@@ ings rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.7 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second one to the month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combinations of three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was valuable , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 after G@@ abe of the 3 dosage is significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ ity that were achieved in a clinical trial for 1- 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , one month after the completion of the full vaccine ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the im@@ pregn@@ ate is either a 2 @-@ cans @-@ vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with a combined hep@@ atitis with 360 ELISA units @-@ in@@ for@@ ated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis B surface .
&quot; with persons who were at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ m@@ mun@@ isation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after the immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
the immune action against both anti@@ gens were comparable to that which after vacc@@ ination were compared to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combined hep@@ atitis - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis B cooling volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months @-@ vacc@@ ination is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months in@@ oc@@ tr@@ ap scheme .
if the first dose ambitions in the second year at the same time with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ ther@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ sia ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mask @-@ vaccine vaccine has been administ@@ ered , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was adequate . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial , which was conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults , showed similar to current ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ary rates as for the former formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after res@@ ign@@ ant to examine the par@@ tik@@ el and / or physiological visible changes .

&quot; the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in through dra@@ ined waters , etc . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ ending face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ id ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
as with all vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix not completely protect against an infection with hep@@ atitis A@@ or hep@@ atitis B ) even if the complete vaccine has been completed with 2 cans .
if you are already infected / your child prior to administration of both vacc@@ inated Ambi@@ rix / is ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick / feels ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
an protection against other infections that cause the liver damag@@ ing or symptoms which are similar to those of a hep@@ atitis or hep@@ atitis B infection cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can occur through ju@@ ck@@ skin rash , breathing difficulties or tongue . • If with you / your child has already occurred an allergic reaction to a former vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • If you have a severe infection with f@@ ever . &quot;
• If you want to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B quickly ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the commonly used administration of the second vaccine dose ) .
in any possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis C vaccine with a reduced sal@@ ary to effective components per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of an form@@ inal hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ gram of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B cooling ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced sal@@ ary to efficient components is usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination before finishing the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from people who inj@@ ected in serious blood disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle tissue . • If you are weak@@ ened by your child due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s own defence , or if you fall / your child to a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases but the immune response of these people on vacc@@ ination can not be sufficiently so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
&quot; 21 If you have your doctor , if you can take your child further medicines , including those who can get without prescription , or if you have not been vacc@@ inated without prescription ( antibodies ) or if you have administ@@ ered / or immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( antibodies ) / has or this is planned in the near future . &quot;
but it may be that in this case the immune response on the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated on separate bodies and as possible different li@@ mbs at the same time . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix will be administ@@ ered at the same time or just before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be adequate . &quot;
&quot; commonly , Ambi@@ rix will not be administ@@ ered , except it is urgent that they can be vacc@@ inated against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of data , which has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the discharge , the CH@@ MP opinion that remains positive that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix was only used in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine was limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
Ammon@@ ite can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ valuable En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium bovine spongiform encephalopath@@ y ( deer ) in the history of history .
Ammon@@ aps will - split up to several individuals with meals - swal@@ lowed under the food or through a Gast@@ ro@@ ome i@@ esch@@ eme ( through the ab@@ dom@@ es in the stomach of leading hose ) and administ@@ ered by the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , as Ammon@@ ite did not compare with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ drug drug , i.e. without any active ingre@@ dient ) . &quot;
&quot; Ammon@@ ite can also cause appeti@@ te ac@@ idity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ation , hydr@@ ation , fl@@ ada@@ che , red@@ ness , red@@ ness , ex@@ iting , red@@ ness , rash , un@@ pleas@@ ing body or weight increase . &quot;
the committee for human cells ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Ammon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high ammon@@ ium values are effectively prevented .
Ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , as due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is indi@@ ces in all patients , where a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ology already has already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born old ( within the first 28 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which exists after the first life @-@ sm@@ on@@ at ) , then there is an indication of use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ op@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in granite form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated considering the protein @-@ toler@@ ant and for the growth and development of the daily intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of so@@ dium poly@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg and in growing and adults .
in case of patients who suffer from an early manipul@@ ator or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ ates is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets must not be administ@@ ered by patients with s@@ ni@@ b@@ ances , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ soph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , if the tablets are not immediately going to get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with so@@ dium and eco @-@ building clinical states only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of n@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate on the liver and the kid@@ neys will take place AM@@ MONA@@ PS should only be applied with patients with liver or kidney failure .
the meaning of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal exp@@ ir@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there were also a hes@@ itation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ishing number of working nerve cells in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be noticed whether phen@@ yl@@ et@@ ate is re@@ tired of man into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during the lac@@ ing time is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , with AM@@ MONA@@ PS entered at 56 % of patients at least an unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ or@@ ek@@ ite patients , which developed a met@@ abolic in@@ opath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ de , Panz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ er@@ ge@@ othermal neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosage occurred at a 5 month old small child with a vers@@ ed single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed at a in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ tical neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active connection that is con@@ ju@@ red by acet@@ yl@@ ation with gl@@ ut@@ amine with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine that is re@@ tired over the kid@@ neys .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as altern@@ ate carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ureth@@ ane cycle may be accepted that for every gram bi@@ ased so@@ dium but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.7 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis was early early and the treatment is immediately begun to improve the survival chances and the clinical result .
&quot; progn@@ osis of the early mani@@ fold form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born was almost always inf@@ alli@@ ist , and the disease led itself in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with the stu@@ ff@@ ed @-@ free an@@ al@@ oga within the first year of life . &quot;

&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood flow to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ary ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ er &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ ni@@ al measurement at the electro@@ kar@@ og@@ ram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox to prevent blood cl@@ auses on patients applied to one PCI , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute in patients with Ang@@ ina or cardi@@ op@@ ause to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients attended the main study about the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox@@ en @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different drug to prevent ble@@ eding ) with the conventional com@@ for@@ ting treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI the patient is often a cl@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery in order to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ auses , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; at the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without hub of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac accidents or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ zation ) after 30 days or one year as well as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients suffering from one PCI , an@@ gi@@ o@@ ox regarding all indicators was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except in severe blood circulation , in which it was significantly more effective than hep@@ at@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may possibly be vulnerable ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other st@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who had recently awarded a blood , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or cardi@@ ac infection . &quot;
the committee for human medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that an@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during an PCI a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin is .
September 2004 the European Commission gave the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for the sale of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lever ) in case of emergency grip or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended Initi@@ al dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is performed in another episode a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the operation on 1,75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
after the PCI required according to clinical requirements the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; directly in front of the procedure , a bol@@ ting of 0.5 mg / kg will be administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplast@@ y . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI card consists of an initi@@ als in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ation of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate subsequent in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of a few Bol@@ us @-@ G@@ abe of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned . &quot;
this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to less than 225 seconds should be a second bolt of 0.7 mg / kg / body weight .
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitutional and dil@@ uted medicines must be carefully mixed and administ@@ ered Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis rapidly in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administ@@ ered properly . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , treated one PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,@@ 4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; lies the ACT @-@ value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ dose of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg to be administ@@ ered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) which were included for approval , was the ACT value 5 minutes after gift of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 When patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ se@@ ated patients is an@@ gi@@ ox con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see under Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous gift of un@@ frac@@ tional hep@@ atitis or 8 hours following the termination of sub@@ cut@@ aneous fer@@ ous hep@@ atitis .

&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra is used to treat adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ ted ( under the skin ) into the ab@@ dom@@ es , the thig@@ h or the upper arm inj@@ iz@@ o , or as continuous inf@@ usion with an ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin for the regulation of gl@@ uc@@ t@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) produced in the blood or the ins@@ ulin cannot be eff@@ ected .
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very slightly from human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter period of activity has as a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin for patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body could not produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; with type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin cannot be eff@@ ected effective , Ap@@ i@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effic@@ acy was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed Hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( 7,@@ 60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ per . &quot;
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 50 % after six months with Ap@@ i@@ dra in comparison to 10.9 % at human Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra may not be used in patients who may possibly be vulnerable ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of Ap@@ i@@ dra may possibly be adjusted when it is administ@@ ered with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood of glu@@ el@@ ect@@ al seals .
September 2004 the European Commission of San@@ o@@ fi @-@ A@@ venti@@ s Deutschland GmbH distributed a permit for the transport of Ap@@ i@@ dra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ i@@ dra is referred to as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of the ab@@ dom@@ inal ceiling or del@@ ici@@ als or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the ab@@ dom@@ es .
&quot; due to the reduced gl@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ishing ins@@ ulin , the ins@@ ulin can be en@@ forced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effic@@ acy , the brand ( Her@@ - co @-@ operation ) , the In@@ sul@@ ch@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ized , etc . ) , the type of in@@ sul@@ us ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method may draw a change in the ins@@ ulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 A inadequate dosage or the inter@@ ruption of a treatment , in particular in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a dia@@ be@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ er ; these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening . &quot;
the change@@ over from one patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin a different vend@@ or should be under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
the time of occurrence of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the drug profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore be changed at the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; among the substances , which can increase the ble@@ eding activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emic , Fi@@ br@@ ate , anti @-@ ox@@ et@@ ric Ox@@ i@@ da@@ se ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , anti @-@ ox@@ y Ox@@ i@@ da@@ se , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and Sul@@ fon@@ amid @-@ antibiotics . &quot;

&quot; Animal Experim@@ ental studies on reproductive @-@ tox@@ icity revealed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether in@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine into the human mother &apos;s milk @-@ milk , but generally occurs ins@@ ulin neither in the mother &apos;s milk , nor will it res@@ or@@ ated after or@@ ical use . &quot;
&quot; below are the clinical studies known from clinical studies ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on availability of availability ) . &quot;

heavy hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emic with consciousness can be given by an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that will be treated by one accordingly trained person or by in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous go@@ abe of gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor .
after a gl@@ uc@@ t@@ onal j@@ ection the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for the heavy hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces the blood sugar levels by stimulation of the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose ( especially by sk@@ elet@@ on muscles and fat ) as well as by the im@@ itation of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ ther@@ - be carried out by isl@@ anders and the effic@@ acy is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 @-@ diabetes , in@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic relevant dos@@ ing effect of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ ing effect , just like human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
ins@@ ul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as normal human rights and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ ing effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; the data was clear that during an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a compar@@ ative post@@ p@@ ran@@ ge@@ al gly@@ ca@@ emic control is achieved , as being given by human nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which is 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
