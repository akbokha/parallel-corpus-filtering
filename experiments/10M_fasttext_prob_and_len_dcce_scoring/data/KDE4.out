package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size they provide some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
&quot; to load these modules at &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select settings and create settings .... open the map @-@ card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list with standard model modules from the box ; add @-@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system , if you have installed additional software . &quot;
you should install the package base that contains &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; then you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module An@@ filter filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M buil@@ ders in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to display extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently indicated web page . as a default , the display begins with the root no@@ des of the document , example : Docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this litter . &quot;
the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type I@@ node / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; the partic@@ ularity of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists of depic@@ ted folder arch@@ ies with the help of the size of objects in wast@@ ed structures . each object is proportional to its size . this size has to possess the property that the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; the size reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , it can be easily recognized , even if a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ b@@ View , represents a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . to simplify navigation , the leg@@ is@@ tical navigation possess useful color and marking system . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode can be either depth for the slight detection of the nest@@ les , or illustration of a different file peculi@@ arity like name , owner , group or M@@ IME @-@ type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be referred to with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder name . for each feature you can specify , only if enough space to display or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate legislation is to occur ( whereby the settings of sub@@ ordin@@ ate legislation will occur ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in Dar@@ ing algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be observed , that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ aties in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rect@@ angle is lost . &quot;
&quot; as division of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries is provided , the implementation is left behind it . here it is intended for the coated and avoiding space lu@@ sten by setting up the surfaces such as square . the best methods of this respect are lines , columns or recur@@ sive material . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum area for an entry about the menu entry view . instead , a smo@@ kers in the area of the higher level licence is drawn to indicate that this area is actually covered by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets which was developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the picture gallery can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under extrac@@ tor picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you call the image gallery , you will open a dialog with which you can define the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery in a text field .
the option pictures per line has a sli@@ der and a rot@@ ary field to set the number of th@@ umb@@ nails each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the An@@ kreu@@ z@@ feld fil@@ en@@ ame of the image display , whether the fil@@ en@@ ames will be shown below the mini@@ ature in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the starter box size of the picture , you specify , whether the file size is shown below the mini @-@ pictures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ depth image size , you specify whether the size of the images is shown below the mini@@ ature picture in the gallery . &quot;
in dialog folder you will specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folders will be included .
&quot; in the file selection of saving in HTML file , you will be where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the An@@ kreu@@ z@@ feld sub@@ folder , you can adjust to a sli@@ der or a rotating area , up to which level the sub@@ folders will be included . &quot;
you can copy the original pictures in the gallery you want to copy the original pictures to the gallery .
you can use the commentary box directory you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the cross @-@ depth color depth you can specify for th@@ umb@@ nails a different colour depth as in the original pictures .

&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ came ; - of course , each medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ came ; together . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ came ; contains a quick image editing with basic training tools . you can use these to review your photos , comments and correct . the processing capacity can be easily extended with KDE Image plug @-@ ins ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ came ; easy to use , it provides stupid professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit colour and all available modules support the raw materials handling by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ export and ICC workflow - workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens to be sought . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ came ; an open source project . that means , it is on the support of end users . they should therefore report problems and improvement . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ came ; attempts to make the mel@@ ting of problems or improvement acts as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu provides an entry containing a under@@ lined system . all required information is already registered . follow the instructions to complete your report . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ came ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers come to each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; digi@@ came ; however , we would like to answer you questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , you should speak English , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ came ; homepage to visit News about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ came ; to learn .
the best start to participate at &amp; digi@@ came ; is the registration in the developer @-@ mailing list . guidance on the login list of the developers mailing list from &amp; digi@@ came ; .
&quot; when you get &amp; digi@@ came ; for the first time you are asked , where you want to store your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder name or click the folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data file is stored . this path remains equal for all the image folders .
&quot; later , you can add a lot of folders like you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ came ; will in addition use as Al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ ti@@ am set up collections . &quot;
&quot; if you already have an image collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the pictures contains , as a base folder . no picture will be changed every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the passage of the folder you will see a progress display like this : &quot;
&amp; digi@@ came ; dur@@ o moves re@@ ital@@ ic the bibli@@ ography in its entire depth . you can &apos;t make sub@@ folders unless it is hidden in hidden st@@ folder . this can you complete the par@@ hal@@ bs &amp; digi@@ came ; do you take a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; when you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ au will not take photos as symbols . you can change the album by selecting a popular photo from the album and then use it on the folder symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folders , you can setup in &amp; digi@@ tization . after that you should learn how to manage My albums and folders , to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw material support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so it can also deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help of Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Support . &quot;
how to set up and work with raw files in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ o@@ der@@ settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flows .
&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ came ; - of course , each medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ came ; together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will then be implemented as a record network . the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use in circumstances to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; we used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital k@@ amer@@ as@@ . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , continuing software collection for digital cameras , which is an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras are using the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are big files and transmission lines about the serial port slowly , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found at this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be created with li@@ mo if support , so that the P@@ umb@@ nails of digi@@ ti@@ des can be reliably viewed in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . the P@@ 50@@ s support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not see th@@ umb@@ nails might be very slow or the production could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy it can expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image Plug @-@ modules : the KDE Image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a joint module for &amp; digi@@ tization . the aim is to provide the modules to all video programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s essentially easier , &amp; digi@@ came ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform . &quot;
to simplify the window you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
&quot; the drag and drop of images is done anywhere : you can attach a picture in another part of the tree structure , over the horizontal cutting line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture does not put into keywords , data list or sou@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to remove the spread @-@ up : JP@@ EG , PN@@ G , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , films and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the toolbar , just when this ind the toolbar can be displayed . which fields are shown in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; M@@ an Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; presents a organised view on your photo@@ graphi@@ es . these albums can be saved according to the folders , where they are stored on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the alpha properties , or after the date , where the album can first be created . the date can be changed into the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there . you can move to the same way also several photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album includes a collection of photos and the album properties , to give you information about this collection . to access the album Properties , you must click on the album and edit in the context menu pane . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed by a joint name or delete albums by collection . if you want to add new collections or delete it , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort out your albums by date with view albums by date sort .
&quot; the kno@@ bs El@@ t@@ ester , average , neu@@ ester : these put the date on the oldest , of the latest image or the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ came , the first picture is presented as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; ) . this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; select as an album &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ; in addition you can put the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be wast@@ ed .
&amp; digi@@ came ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My key@@ word list below in the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you choose an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , m@@ ould you just wait while the preview pictures will be generated , so you can avoid using it in the menu Extr@@ as All previous pictures . &quot;
&quot; information about any picture is displayed below the viewing preview . which information is available , you can set up your settings ; select here the albums page and adjust the area of preferences to your wishes . &quot;
the th@@ umb@@ nails will have help window the apparent . if you can rest the mouse pointer at a moment of a picture . the screenshot shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screenshot in the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are everything about what to get at &amp; digi@@ came ; go . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it will fit . you can use all the functions which are using &amp; digi@@ came ; you can choose between the context menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between the be@@ ad of images , a slideshow or the editing of the images . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by drawing up either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... in the section : image editing you can view your photos and change it .
&quot; it may occur that &amp; digi@@ came ; the functionality you need , not at your disposal . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button , and how to customize these requirements when your program will not be revealed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing through other educational programs , some programs can not store these data with the data contained in the picture . thus , these information do not store the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ tization ; provides two ways to turn off . the easiest way , it is possible to select the right mouse button on the preview and select it . in the sub@@ menu you can indicate the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ames of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . notice that you keep the extension ( .j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ came ; delete , it will be removed in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer by &amp; k@@ de ; del@@ ayed . F@@ 8 picture Delete or un@@ f If you prefer to really want , you can use this by making shift ; Ent@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; M@@ a Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos from the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; used either the EX@@ IF @-@ Date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can choose days or weeks in the data sheet below in the file view , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
photos with cat@@ ch@@ ings will provide a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cat@@ alog@@ ously . keywords are stick@@ ers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a key@@ word can be assigned to a photo you can find the photo by selecting this key@@ word or search .
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been marked with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . here , you can also organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; ch@@ ap the keywords , so you can find the keywords that you can find , easily find . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and access to the IP@@ TC dat@@ e@@ fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG . so you can also use your keywords in case of loss of the database re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; digi@@ came ; the images are noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking on the right mouse button either at &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; and then select new key@@ word . if you click a new key@@ word after you click on an existing key@@ word , this is the sub@@ title of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delet@@ ing . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a key@@ word by taking it to the desired position in the tree and drop there . then a menu , which gives you the possibility to push the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be one time in the tree . &quot;
&quot; you can change the characteristics of a key@@ word by selecting it with the right mouse button and edit in the context menu key@@ word . you can change the name of the key@@ word , and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click on the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As a album release . additionally , you can put the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to get a digi@@ tization ; s functionality with key@@ ing can be used , you first need to have your photos with key@@ word . alternatively , you can click on the relevant key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; &quot; alternatively , you can also click the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be shown as soon as you choose one of the keywords in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it has been made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a photo with key@@ word , this will display the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can select a key@@ word , in which you can open the context menu of the photos and select from the keywords menu Rem@@ ove . the menu shows you only the keywords , which were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline View displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ming of the number of images per time unit . a selection framework can be moved above this hist@@ og@@ ram . to select a time frame , you will only apply to the lower rect@@ angle of the selection framework . thus , all related images will be shown in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the field below you can enter a title and store your selection , then it appears in the list below . &quot;
&quot; cover all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ uch@@ ad@@ verse search box is a small lamp that will find the green when searching matches . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all pictures are shown again . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp is red . &quot;
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . you can open this search here but as a live search that has always been described here as a search crit@@ erion . after you saved the fil@@ mm@@ d er Filter in the list .
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the results Save as a search list in the main window . if you choose a name in My search list , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the view of My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;

&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search . &quot;
the advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search@@ engines available with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tization ; s database can search .
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . any option can be added by operators . each option can be added with others about the logical operations All ... , A ... , no ... or at least ... connected . in addition , you can add addi@@ ction of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ tization ; each image characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images compared by compar@@ ing this sig@@ natur@@ es . the lower the difference between two images , the more comply with them . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar choice . by means of a g@@ ell@@ ations , the results choices can be enlarged or discounted . if you move a picture of somewhere over the symbol of irregular search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : open @-@ hand color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ came ; find the matching images . also here can be a sw@@ elling value .
&quot; this rider provides an intuitive ticket tool based on the mar@@ ble @-@ mini program . click C@@ trl ; lin@@ ker mouse button to drag a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this is of course , one of course pre@@ dat@@ ed that your images entered by Ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filters . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; represents a lumin@@ ous in a separate window at your disposal with which you can easily compare them . he works with all supported images formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em bul@@ b from the context menu . the selection will be opened to the lumin@@ ous menu . the selection will be opened to the light ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ ous fast with L extras . &quot;
&quot; the preview bar allows you to compare the pictures , which you want to compare , to the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow displays you to which copy in which window shows you , then those in the other picture is also executed . you can thus compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to load quickly from a picture series . if you use the left mouse button on any preview image , then you will display the left mouse button on any previous image . the right neigh@@ bou@@ red picture is displayed in the right area . this makes it easier to pass through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal attachment can also work directly from the lumin@@ ous as e.g. F@@ 4 file processing .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both viewers in the lumin@@ ous table . this makes it easy to link e.g. visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ voting function , which you can observe in the crossed pole . in order to click the visible area of the picture , you must click the same and the L@@ MB ; then pressed . in the mode preview the images will be shown in the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom control among the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel in order to zoom in and out into zo@@ oming . this happens in both images if you are pre@@ viewing in the mode .
&quot; what is a digital survey administration - apart from the fashion world ? digital survey management considers each part of the process that follows the picture , sc@@ ans or digital photos stores a form of digital survey administration . most of us do this , but not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , finding a plan and practical tips on how to use your pictures , protect , protect and upload photos . we regard the download , convert , group@@ ing , group@@ ing , stream@@ ers , maintain , maintain and export image files . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization control takes on , indi@@ ces , categorized , ass@@ ures , transformed , con@@ sol@@ dered and exported content that has a mon@@ eti@@ zed or cultural value of hab@@ en.@@ quot ; &quot;
&quot; metad@@ ata are defined as data about data . metad@@ ata are provided according to your definition data , providing information on or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment . &quot;
&quot; I d@@ are to claim , if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even need a particular photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have to save very quickly search and a secure filing on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you need something in your system , the construction of information structure in contrast to data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photos are to be saved or at a network drive &amp; etc ; please note that you &apos;ll have to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your storage place unless you were in one year several times at the same place . the remaining photos are made using your data . then you will export sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export is a folder for pictures that you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements like e.g. ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant feed of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % of work files and you will then do not want to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the metad@@ ata to store in the setup page of the metad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tization . this makes sure , you can save the metad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu on the corresponding dot . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? it represents &amp; digi@@ came ; they provide a metad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real job , since you should now choose any photo keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can choose all pictures that need the same attri@@ bute and then put the value then . it makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos on the top photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now take key@@ word , key@@ word , as you are using other programs frequently , or categories continue . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you import cat@@ alog@@ ized images from a different source with embedded key@@ word - then it becomes a problem and can simply build the tree for you . this sort of the Hier@@ archy down within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a sub@@ tree on another . the amended keywords are being pursued by &amp; digi@@ ed ; updated during the sub@@ trees .
&quot; the graphics shows how different metad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and cal@@ ender data is all features of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords , the next section refers to the cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to kat@@ alogue your metad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want to just let them see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . out of the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you see it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you this the Lan@@ de@@ court of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French y 60 years after landing is again present , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you might even hear the still@@ ness . the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos may be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest . if you have images , you should show a story about how to help Him about the mot@@ ive that you move has moved what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is ok if a picture is not perfect , if the strength has only to work with a cap@@ tion for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ came ; you can export them as much text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , then you can even use it for a selection of images at the same time . KDE can even tell it for a selection of images at the same time . KDE you have to tell him a second time for the opening event not a second time . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without the navigation system ? was the earth not a boring planet before Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth ? well , because with images the train of spatial presentation now already starts with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities used to achieve Ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will continue in the future for a lot . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can ex@@ porting your travel virtually through images with geographical references . you can also export the photos at the reception . you can also export the photos at the reception . you can also export the photos at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Maps Viewer . &quot;
&quot; copy@@ left is a word@@ game with copyright and describes the practices to use copy@@ rights to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information about the interior page of &amp; digi@@ came ; when information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for Er@@ co and Writ@@ er ) : this field was supposed to add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization cannot be changed anymore . this field does not support any compromise or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on as a separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for Edit@@ ors ) : associated with the author . this field contains the working @-@ name of the photographer . examples for this may be title , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a reference to the author &apos;s field , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; Editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider area to identify who das@@ h offers . this does not necessarily offer the author . if the photographer can be listed here . if the picture is a warehouse , then the group / agency will offer the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against mis@@ use . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators , delete or change . the solution for this problem is only of low interest . for professionals and holding professionals , this protection is very important to it . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ came ; will provide such a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : PL@@ AT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , turn@@ around , ECC , transmission errors , ag@@ eing of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , lif@@ esp@@ an , temperature , data size , widespread su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that can be lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can also happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so called new media .
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics what reasons a data loss has . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , you need to buy this cau@@ tious and one may not buy longer than a few years of course . of course , you can also get CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers more than gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your im@@ meas@@ ure@@ room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good disc@@ er@@ ning and good recording payments . the best DVD suspension are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . it turns to the right to choose the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you just have been written only . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and the control system . despite this massive protection they require chemical aging , ultr@@ avi@@ olet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster the apparently mir@@ acles with CDs and DVDs , but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that sh@@ ake data from damaged disks , disks , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ orium against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc is able to save 50 GB and thus almost six @-@ layer the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . everything related to CDs and DVDs was also known for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; just burn slowly with a good recording fee on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . also Read the media with a description , date of dr@@ au@@ ts and against animals protected spot . do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; flo@@ ats keep your statistics for itself . your manufac@@ tures include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives : disc@@ othe@@ tical study &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks keep on the longest when you operate in the temper@@ ing range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature control , S@@ MAR@@ T cannot determine this error . some of S@@ MAR@@ T @-@ defined mistakes will not determine the instant fail@@ ures and publishers . the expected life @-@ time period is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the complete loss due to survival . of course , you can also have data loss due to electricity out before you have secured files , but these losses normally can be produced without big problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices are not much failed to do with devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware plac@@ ements , non @-@ destru@@ ctive mother@@ boards and other faul@@ ts . protect yourself from the un@@ avoi@@ dable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against electricity tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is one device that absor@@ bs a part of energy supply . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , remember that not each plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ lap protection . &quot;
if you are looking for an over@@ lap protection then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against fl@@ ashes and thus protecting the correct connected devices .
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should pay attention that also all periods are connected to your system . some manufacturers are also associated with telephone lines . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable of the cable mo@@ dem@@ s and the television card . &quot;
if you have a not@@ ebook then you will need a portable over@@ lap protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain the protection for the modem .
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller variations in electricity lines , it will not really help you to loss of unwanted data . even a fail@@ ing of few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a sub@@ breaking @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically stream battery power . some models allow them to store them up to the current . if you use a US@@ V , then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like an over@@ lap protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the included software will be interesting . &quot;
&quot; concern the potential risk , which is exposed to your computer system and compare its safety in Strom@@ ness with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality pressure protection can be you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V you can use for less than &amp; euro . at the end , you should always remember all the cable before you go into the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as drives under &amp; Linux , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; you are compared to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about compar@@ atively long internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online memory services to you . your free memory is available to you , in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ a year you will get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically calculated by the TCP protocol and included in the large company is included in the offer a backup and a partial memory . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all comm@@ its are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ es@@ ystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integr@@ ity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that you don &apos;t know if a transmission error occurred , not if this is happening in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection against it . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have ever thought . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way than that in your computer . &quot;
un@@ reliable power components are another source of transmission systems as they generate interference within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates , which can deal with record faul@@ ts on lower level and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux , and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in the alpha status . it is still used in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms which is used for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss at not@@ ebook and 46 % in the work@@ station systems . with Not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is already 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the Mei@@ sten think . it is currently confin@@ ed to a lower damage , as such as theft or new installations . and it is currently on Microsoft systems . Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux , has been no longer sight@@ ed for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : false , NTFS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to give the spread file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the course process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status will not be completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise character@@ is@@ tically for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras are going down towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution are already deter@@ ior@@ ated for compact cameras and a high quality optics are the Optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or greater formats . &quot;
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro . so do not make any other responsibility for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re@@ install of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make daily your f@@ uses on an external drive drive . if , then one day , a light@@ ning strike you have luck if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft un@@ gl@@ ücke : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ un@@ locking always means a non @-@ local storage . put your sight@@ ings up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as above is a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save the one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files are to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ator : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . this creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete securing and the last differentiation occurs .
incre@@ mental backup accounts : a backup of the files that has been changed since the last backup . this backup has been created at any time . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is only ab@@ sent and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file tran@@ scription copies r@@ sync just the difference of the files that really changed . this happens un@@ compres@@ sed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after you saved it on your computer to a DVD or another visual medium .
&quot; this course of course leaves you enough time to detect losses and restore . at the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot of each month . each additional di@@ lu@@ tion should be manually done , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : metad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , origin@@ ating images , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and metad@@ ata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , viewing , ... &quot;
&quot; so valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time span in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noticed : &quot;
since the future due to your nature is un@@ predic@@ table you must view everything that is said today . unfortunately there is no other way than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance for@@ wards . unfortunately any less variants you have been used in the past . the less variants you have in the past is so much easier to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use and change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format you should verify your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay in open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional printing of the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let us go out that you have the scal@@ ability with scheduled and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this section to the new record :
&quot; check with the command dm@@ es@@ g , whether your new record was detected from the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollar ; dd , = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc / Source is / dev / s@@ dc &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 , 32 and Reiser@@ FS ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reiser@@ FS if necessary
open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any software you can read it . this task is easier for year to year .
&quot; GI@@ F is a propri@@ etary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore no longer use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PN@@ G was supposed to replace GI@@ F as an open source standard . however , X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Metad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit pro color channel and full transparency . PN@@ G may need Gam@@ ma@@ - and Chro@@ mati@@ st data for enhanced color information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F . this format we would like to recommend you to saving your pictures . &quot;
&quot; T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as image format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compres@@ sed form or in a container with a wast@@ ed Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ dat@@ mus ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) . a problem is however , however , that this format is adapted to many people . there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open raw format that developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed due to the need to use metad@@ ata . a handful of camera is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in order to replace the &amp; quot ; image @-@ resource &quot; &quot; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ forms ) , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archiving . X@@ MP does not fit the metad@@ ata separately from the image file . therefore , you should think about problems in the link between the metad@@ at@@ las and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metad@@ ata standards , which contribute to the activities of D@@ C@@ MI and supporting the activities of D@@ C@@ MI and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlight@@ ening efforts to reach a far @-@ depth acceptance of metad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the map or scanner . as long as the pictures on the camera , you can use it as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fin@@ ite processing , you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ came ; edit , then you should add the metad@@ ata again . these were processed in circumstances from other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the be@@ have images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , ko@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact sheet , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ came ; get a description . in the section adding a photo to an album you can have a description . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ came ; connect them to the computer , connect the camera to the display mode , and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it is trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a pig@@ eon indicator can be displayed at the lower end and the preview images of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not appear to display the file name for each file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information on each entry . with the side properties and metad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of an entry or its metad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and photo information that can be stored internally from the camera . a symbol shows that the picture has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that when a few digital cameras are not available any information . &quot;
&quot; the rider Metad@@ ata shows the internal metad@@ ata such as P@@ 50@@ s , manufacturer not@@ ation , GPS etc. of the image . these information is the same as in the metad@@ ata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization ; or the image editing . please note that these metad@@ ata are not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button Download and then select the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ came ; . when downloading the photos completely deleted from their camera before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired using the standard optionally , select from &amp; k@@ de ; select the photos , use the button Download and then download it . the button Selected is selected as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
if your camera is supported this is an option New download . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ came ; in this case the new pictures have been downloaded with a star in the fore@@ front . if you choose this option will of course only be downloaded the new pictures .
&quot; when you download the buttons all download or Selected works , a dialog with which you can select the target album . the list of the existing albums will be sorted according to the folder you can read in the section My albums . select the target album from the list and click OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , click OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the requested photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all deleted at one time by selecting the button . if you just need to delete them , then you need to delete them at first and then delete delet@@ ing out . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to restore your camera removed from the camera . so you should carefully check if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you do delete it from the camera , since this is much faster . &quot;
cameras are used as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive names . this can be deleted once the photos from the camera . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the image and for date @-@ based under@@ taking . if you use this latter option automatically a folder is created per day .
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three further options , which will be done before the photos stored on the record . the first two concern the data about the author in section Standard Aut@@ orian fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you desire a different file format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % d % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ ing@@ time . &quot;
&quot; when you use the camera data file , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in small letters . or in case letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ came ; used for a photo , will appear below the name that provides the camera in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame is stored and automatically used when you open the camera . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ tization ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time frame . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Metad@@ ata you can read further details , about the information that has embedded your camera into the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally switched off , and if your camera does not supply this information , leaves the photo in the original orientation . if you turn off the automatic switch , use the button @-@ wide and select the automatic ming in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera is provided information about the date on which the photo has been made available , it can be used to download under@@ standings in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are provided in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change it , you need to switch this option . use the button file @-@ based sub@@ competitions at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est way of photos from your computer to load their camera is the button sel@@ ector . select then upload . the file sel@@ ector dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that will be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ came ; you where the images are to be loaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select here the desired folder and click OK to upload the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position meant that is specified in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tudes and which can be displayed on one card . the identification of data can be indicated by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not just for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to provide an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agent can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can click on a browser which indicates the area . if you want to move a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization , or just want to document the place of the photos , it is good to document the position data of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is how the GPS data is in the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , s@@ add@@ l@@ ites and cart@@ on files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally about the manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera , which has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a couple who work with GPS recip@@ ients together . either as map or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q i@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be performed with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel , as this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical assignment . &quot;
there are various programmes for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extrac@@ ting the data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same below &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the mark @-@ made coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ googl@@ e.com shows no European road types . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ came ; try to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that can access the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tization . to switch on these settings , you must switch in the menu Settings ; you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
action can preview or start editing preview image . you place the default behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tization ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this site contains , as shown below , the stand@@ ardis@@ ation and the copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , if the option for downloading from the camera interface is selected . also with a database synchron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer : this field should be the professional photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer , as this is a detailed description of the author &apos;s field , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; Editor is a syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors : use this field to enter the photo . this must not be the author , if this is the image other &amp; quot ; ) . if the image is an inventory , then the group or agency that the image should be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC promotions store the data into the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this is achieved that the metad@@ ata are permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ came ; . these metad@@ ata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; images referred to as a built @-@ in lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions in images included in pictures , they are already written by the pictures ; they are over@@ written by the pictures ; over@@ written . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer in the main window via a file rests . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ came ; supports a number of different images and audio formats . to specify which data types &amp; digi@@ came ; view , you can add the file extensions to this list and remove it . each file in a &amp; digi@@ came ; Alb@@ um@@ folder that has no such extensions , von &amp; digi@@ came ; ignored . &quot;
the default settings can be set back again by pressing the button to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ came ; can then be switched on this page on the default values . however , some images do not use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . you should only use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can obtain better visible results . &quot;
&quot; by default the image editing a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose them here . you can use this toolbar , if you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ lined areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing this picture mode can be inserted with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and p@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia .
&quot; with the setting PN@@ G compres@@ sing , you can reduce the size of PN@@ G files . this operation is not reduced the quality of PN@@ G files . the only effect is that the image data is needed more time to cut and un@@ pack . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value on a high compression . thereby , it means a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option T@@ IF@@ F files compres@@ sing , you can switch the De@@ fl@@ ate -@@ Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ular algorithms for T@@ IF@@ F pictures . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no effect on the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm . &quot;
&quot; with the adjustment of loss JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files , you can freely save you . even if you have written the losses and file much better than with normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was not supported , metad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous releases of &amp; digi@@ came ; the image machining only a picture appearance for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of editing editing . &quot;
&quot; the standard side is that all green pixels are equal in the output . if you use this option with a minimum loss of details . this option identifi@@ es a little soft , eliminate this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option identifi@@ es the 2x@@ 2 Git@@ ter@@ bra@@ ster with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD @-@ quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white distance of the camera is used . otherwise , if the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the whit@@ ening is not set . standard is it a solid colour balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white map that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ taking pictures in four steps more details in the nickname . for other cameras will be ignored this option .
&quot; the standard is the top of the top , so the parts of your images are burned down , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the nickname , as they show the c@@ lich@@ ens in various ro@@ at@@ ories . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the nickname . &quot;
&quot; this is possible since blue pixels in general is not so fast s@@ ati@@ ful like green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red @-@ parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a matter how much colour or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option re@@ constructed , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be individually adapted for each image separately . &quot;
put the L@@ umin@@ ator worth after your taste . you probably need to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization . this can be too conservative . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing should you have conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to reck@@ on a complete picture from the partial image sensor that presents many cameras and which represents a matrix colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ kon@@ y .
&quot; and digi@@ came ; and D@@ cra@@ w put you three alternatives available : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm for me . it produces color @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) it was interesting when you look for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
if you know the colour deviation of your lin@@ ers you can put the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction . since you will be carried out during the raw materials .
a profile translated the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ came ; information such as the colour information of a Far@@ br@@ aum in the others are to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
conduct questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / colour management module with raw files .
&quot; color profile Fol@@ der you here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you will save all your profiles . &quot;
&quot; settings of the ICC profiles , you have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed while opening the raw file . &quot;
the colour management view is an alternative compared to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are just your pictures and is not managed by the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be used to the c@@ amer@@ aman and model that you use . not all profiles are created on the same type . currently there are some , such as Canon , which do not have colour mapping or Gam@@ mak@@ or@@ re@@ ation . currently , d@@ cra@@ w gam@@ ma not need for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to perform the color tone yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft Proof profile , with which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you can print image as your camera and some colors can therefore be highly saturated , instead of leaving you on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is pretty obvious that colour profile is provided for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles which match together . this answer is of course in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon Profil@@ er leaves the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ und S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; pic@@ tured and image work@@ stations supported ; many modules support , which have been written to co @-@ operate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select that you want to use , and these are then deleted from &amp; digi@@ tization . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short command for tasks that can be performed by modules , can be set in the menu under settings short command . &quot;
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slideshow should be simple to compreh@@ end the time between the pictures , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other application areas are switching off the metad@@ ata , or which appears at the lower end of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is connected to a camera that is connected to the computer . currently , you are connected here seri@@ elle , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can put the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) cameras from the camera box . you have to select here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / or , indicate on which you hang your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with a digi@@ tization ; to use , you need to connect the camera with your computer to put it into the ad mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; try out , whether &amp; digi@@ came ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es ; if not , you can put camera dell and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can choose any type of name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu of cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them all here . &quot;
with the Option confirmation dialog for the rel@@ oc@@ ating of &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer you can adjust the spec@@ tr@@ inity of &amp; digi@@ came ; when delet@@ ing a photo in an album . in the inter@@ sections of a photo and delet@@ ing a album you will find further details .
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be silent by &amp; digi@@ tization ; used , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any back@@ wards . otherwise , you have to apply the changes to the button of changes . &quot;
you can also send the display of the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ came ; when star@@ ch under@@ tie . this speeds up under circumstances the start @-@ process of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
the setting Bei@@ m start looking for new photos are forces and digi@@ came ; the basic folders according to new or deleted albums / photos were deleted . this extended the starting time of &amp; digi@@ came ; when something from the base folder has been deleted &amp; digi@@ came ; you whether it should delete them from the database .
different shades can be used in &amp; digi@@ came ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can choose from settings design from the toolbar . a preview of available designs will be revealed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ came ; to create more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ came ; contains a quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve . the image editing can be started by clicking on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry ads / editing .
the editing process contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ came ; so you may not be part of your distribution . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section image editing .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size displays . &quot;
a menu bar on the top of the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; editing functions of editing editing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file saving , or the button save from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should possibly finish a copy of your image before you change it . this can be saved with file stor@@ ing .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo you can restore the original image , using the original button re@@ generate the image editing in the toolbar . you then loose every change you have done in the photo since the last stor@@ ing . &quot;
virtually any action of the editing process can be ref@@ unded or restored . the last action you can switch off by selecting them back or restored by selecting Edit restore from the menu .
&quot; if you often use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to get back and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; click on the back@@ locks or restore button in the toolbar , you get a context menu . if you choose one of the menu entries , all actions are also made retro@@ fitting or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
&quot; you can in the photo in and out of zoom in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the In@@ sight@@ ed menu . &quot;
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : enlar@@ ging factor automatically select &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come in the normal view , where you do not want it . if you do not like this , you can call this in the dialogue dialog by &amp; digi@@ came ; you can view this in the dialogue dialog by &amp; digi@@ came ; see this you can call the section to set up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image file in the menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print@@ dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single pictures or whole sent@@ ences . whole artwork can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album ex@@ por@@ ting press assist@@ ent . if you follow the wiz@@ ard you just need to meet your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; main window has a side bar on the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is cli@@ cked : &quot;
&quot; simply click the same tab , the side bar will appear and again will disappear into the edge . &quot;
&quot; in the marking view , you can insert the cap@@ tions with unlimited size or insert . note the note below . the text is copied . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ N and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII character and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut down to 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after having comment , you use either the button An@@ gle or change just to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the touch @-@ button there is one button . with this you can read further metad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also read the metad@@ ata in the files . however , this will always be performed if you have written a metad@@ ata setting , which is always written into the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the section evaluation shows a review scheme from 0 to 5 stars , and can be used in Su@@ ples and sor@@ ting . it can be used either with a single mouse @-@ click on the 5 stars in the page bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the assessment is written in the IP@@ TC field in the following table . the en@@ coding follows the diagram in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for the filtering the keywords , the keywords tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned at this &amp; digi@@ tization ; session included . &quot;
the key@@ ing tree is adjusted dynam@@ ically to the given search word . you can restrict the number of options in search of a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief in the entry of keywords in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords may also be set by selecting the respective application areas in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main window and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is only applied to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search views are used , only the cutting @-@ set of these two is displayed . all inherited keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop them . suppose you have selected some pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and click the selection . then you will find a dialog that you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is chosen at no key@@ word . they were selected with Str@@ g + a , and after that a key@@ word has been drawn up and stored there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be re@@ activated by settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that there is one or his needs , you can easily change it with a double @-@ clicking on the text and the setting range . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , after which is sear@@ ched in the database . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
you can create an exhaus@@ tive search of all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group . the options can then be seen as follows : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited there to 1 GB and you will not want to store the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve basically made it to &amp; digi@@ came ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you can use a color@@ managed workflow from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color@@ managed workflow you can reach that the colors available on your monitor of your camera or scanner and that the colors will print you or on the web to publish them out of your digital dark chamber .
&quot; when the theme is coming to color administration , then everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to provide for the results that he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate information about color management . in addition , you will find links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image is full of the criteria listed below , you must not take care of colour management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor of the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum k@@ ali@@ bri@@ ert . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; their only different images are by e @-@ mail or the Web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is . &quot;
so if the R@@ GB works so well and make life for everybody so easy to use why one should then use a different color foam and thus have to think about color managed ?
&quot; a visual example of limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we really see can be seen below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ an area , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger color dreams so please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om site and then click on information and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work for it only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum or not , you need to work your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ eren , since s@@ R@@ GB sets out the circle . if you work as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve an image in most cases . use it therefore before you try a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , covering the same , automatic and contrast automatic correc@@ ting automatic correction are automatically trying to experiment out of your colors . they will have to experiment with these effects to see which best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scal@@ ates the lumin@@ osity value over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the bright@@ est point is as bright as possible without its colour sh@@ aded to change . this function is often an Mag@@ ical correction for images that are dark or balanced . &quot;
&quot; at the same : this method forms the lumin@@ ance of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ming of the intellig@@ ent@@ sia as is as flat as possible . thus it does not produce very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces a very powerful operation that may either have mir@@ acles with a picture or it was destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic scanning : this method maxim@@ izes the colour area in the red , green and blu@@ ep@@ al . you can find the dark and bright bor@@ t@@ ints and adjust the rot@@ ary , green and blu@@ ef@@ alls on the complete hist@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; contrast contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of a picture by one of the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the white distance from &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the whit@@ ening of a photo .
&quot; the whit@@ ening correction is something limited , there is a color foam with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are able to perform too far from origin@@ ality in the raw mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode will perform , your possibilities for correction better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white @-@ tail @-@ weapon @-@ proof of the copyright of Paw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it via the menu entry color haw@@ ks of the image processing .
&quot; the fore@@ front can be adjusted in size . on the left side , the original image can be seen as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will look dynam@@ ically to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whit@@ eboard .. &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixels under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram .
&quot; right top , a hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ming will change that dynam@@ ically changed as soon as you have a parameter . this hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ming you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ancy . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adjusting allows you to improve the un@@ attend@@ ant of your photos or also to down . &quot;
&quot; An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color @-@ temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the images to use the colour temperature of the white temperature . this way also the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; additionally , you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the cap@@ tion of indic@@ ator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in the white pattern . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indication and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons saved as and charging make exactly this . any setting of the whit@@ ening you set you can save it into a text file and upload it later .
the button settings again puts all the filter values back on its standard values and the corresponding neutr@@ ality of the white cover . note that also neutr@@ als can be found another photo as your original . if you save it will change your original image .
&quot; you can adjust here the codi@@ les of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding is also required for high @-@ quality images , PN@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and the allocation of color shades . it can be performed by sub@@ window for the use of shades . a det@@ a@@ illed manual for the use of shades . a det@@ a@@ illed manual for the use of shades . a det@@ a@@ illed manual for the use of colors .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors of sound@@ proo@@ fs . this tool provides an integrated way to save multiple colour channels at the same time and allows you to always use your settings so that you can always use the same error , so you can always find the same correction . in the manual of the sound@@ proo@@ fs you find further information . &quot;
&quot; a very powerful way of exposure problems to correct is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool color effects will give you four color effects , a solar @-@ effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a cant@@ onal filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was solar stabil@@ isation , also Sab@@ ati@@ er called , a effect of was created by the delicate phot@@ ob@@ struc@@ turing of the additional light . this had the effect that light@@ ning ranges dar@@ ker and the colors made by the second illumination . this tool was an integral neg@@ atives of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar stabil@@ isation . at about 50 % intensity , the image is possible to generate what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is finally a negative image that is so not to generate credits . &quot;
this is an example of the solar power supply . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the works ( 2 ) . the intensity intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vivi@@ d filters sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it is different from a satur@@ ation that makes it a stronger contrast , which makes the colors brilliant and smooth . try it easily , he em@@ ni@@ cer many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the mark@@ name designed for one on day@@ light . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as greatly saturated color shades , but also some photographs make it a lot of photo@@ grap@@ hen . but the characteristics of the choice for natural photo@@ grap@@ hen . Vel@@ vi@@ as is also a lot of photo@@ grap@@ hen . but the characteristics of the choice for natural photographer . &quot;
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast . the parameters levels controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ating the strength of the ne@@ ath . with great pictures the filter can be the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contr@@ asting of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors . all of your adjusting entries can be viewed using the result . once you are using the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can get a photo in bad light conditions . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will gain a good choice for satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool is a good choice to increase the satur@@ ation instead of increasing . all changes you can perform in preview . if he likes the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / gam@@ ma is the tool toner correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog on this tool acts very complicated , you need only the field of sli@@ ders . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graphs of the intensity , a hist@@ og@@ ram , of active channel or the selected area . under the graphs are three sli@@ ders into the image . the left side represents the dark values and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and take care of how the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically , by the settings of the image , updated . on the left hand side are the following options available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ og@@ ram with a linear or log@@ is@@ th@@ mic Y axis is often the linear hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ming of a single column only . in this case the log@@ is@@ th@@ ine inhal@@ ation is useful for use .
&quot; three shelves : the top for dark t@@ ints , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle notes , frequent gam@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ et can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the inputs , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automated adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output : the output sets enable the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two shelves that can be used to evaluate the output , e.g. the compression of the output is used to create a hidden picture as a background while creating something different in the foreg@@ round . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set according to the values of the image .
save as and loading : with these buttons the values indicated in the file system can be stored and later used . it will be used in the Gimp Levels format .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ets , the inputs are automatically re@@ designed for all shadows , means and sun @-@ t@@ ints that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to put the inputs for rot@@ ary , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ous channels . &quot;
the option In@@ bel@@ ung indic@@ ator controls all colours channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and to display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect at the final result .
&quot; below you can see an example for the adjusting of the inputs applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the origin@@ als and the target picture shows . the preview is updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modifications channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed by the module :
&quot; besides this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ is@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures associated with a digital camera , the linear mode is produced by linear mode , the linear mode produces a wide beams . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ ine mode helps in the log@@ ically mode . &quot;
&quot; if you move for example a cur@@ v@@ ot to the right , for example , the bright tones , then you can see that this bright tones with dar@@ ker dro@@ p@@ ave @-@ respon@@ ds and that will be dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ ings to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings in the area you want to change , a suitable line on the curve is shown that the original value is shown . create a point on this line and move it up and down to the value according to your taste . &quot;
save as and charging : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each turn you have created can be stored on file system and later be loaded on the file format is the Gimp Kur@@ ven@@ format .
&quot; if you want to create this method and the three colour buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun @-@ t@@ ints . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the red , green , blue and fl@@ umin@@ ated curve . &quot;
&quot; the option cap@@ tiv@@ ating indic@@ ator controls all colours channels to display excess pixels . if in more than a channel over@@ loaded pixel , you get the combined result . here it is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect at the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that has been corrected in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kan@@ al . Sch@@ atten@@ uation and sun @-@ t@@ ints was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of &amp; digi@@ came ; artwork is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the colour shades of the photo .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of editing editing .
&quot; with the channel sel@@ ector box , you can select the color for the hist@@ og@@ ram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by showing the relative distribution and envel@@ ope . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as comparison with their own rider . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ms to show you the corresponding color value .
&quot; the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you also activate the appropriate color components . this is particularly practical when you are also using the appropriate color components . this is especially convenient , when you use the appropriate color @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white por@@ traits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible rob@@ ber@@ ship which occurs in the same place in the color canal and their rob@@ ber@@ ster in each channel is different . if that is the case you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you first will reduce the Far@@ mer first . &quot;
the stor@@ ing as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each mix@@ er setting enables you to save for later and then load the file format is the Gimp channel blend format .
the option In@@ bel@@ ung indic@@ ator controls all colours channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and to display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was re@@ model@@ ed . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / White photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action capacity . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working horse , as colour images can be easily converted to the machine . also with a set of film @-@ roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ ming with a green lens filter . this looks good in all scen@@ eries and fits particularly well to por@@ traits against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ ming with a orange lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; rot@@ ect : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ ming with a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates a dramatic move @-@ effects , and can sim@@ ulate the lun@@ ar to day time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) rot@@ ect . &quot;
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ ming with a yellow lime filter . this is the natural color tone correc@@ tive and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) Yellow filter .
&quot; Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates hot bright and medium sounds , while he adds a bit cold into the shadow of a print and re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ balls . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool texture can be used to apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a text to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on an canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall . the menu entry picture can be used for it . &quot;
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the el@@ ight of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ ture@@ effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder into the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame . this is a psych@@ ologic barrier to the dispute eye . below the frame can add the module from the editing process .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired Rachel type for your image . continuous the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce cuts it with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : width of the frame in percent . the value area for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this with the frame decorative image will be greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio have . this is important for printing of images , especially if you have used the tool to cut aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into an image at any point . this also goes to several places when you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text device , orientation , color from the color area and the character set with its features such as you need . you will simply choose a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sight@@ ed background . already , the image is finished . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you click on the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the image is once saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool sten@@ cil can be used to put a sten@@ cil on a picture .
the menu picture template uses the image processing can be used to put sten@@ cils via a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to work to PN@@ G file format and should simply add an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ came ; mailing list digi@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; when you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your template folder in dialog with the button @-@ button folders in dialog . select the folder in the folder you will be copied for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for the sten@@ cils , a buil@@ ders that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cils . the selection of the folder is updated automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , three buttons with which you can change the larger factor and adjust the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button increased the image into the image . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; short@@ cut , the underlying picture . it is centered to the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the sten@@ cil to the whole picture , you must check the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move the button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
&quot; if you want to use the sten@@ cil to your image , then the image is then automatically adapted to the default size . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ came ; provides three different tools to har@@ ps . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but created especially in dark areas , gr@@ ated images . &quot;
shar@@ p@@ ness mask is working on the contrast of the edges to look a picture shar@@ p@@ ly . actually it &apos;s not a bit that works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric m@@ ess and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
&quot; possibly the best of the three , since he really improves the har@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images need a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the resolution so observe a little bl@@ ur . the same phenomenon can be observed if colors are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need more post@@ ulated shar@@ p@@ ation as normal cameras for the home user .
&quot; with JP@@ EG images , a camera has been applied to internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . pictures in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner address a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable them , you will get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can shar@@ p@@ able results by shar@@ pen a photo with the shar@@ pen foot@@ step . this allows you to call on the menu entry .
&quot; you should hereby be careful , since the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen increases the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , the most important technique to shar@@ p@@ ens the tool can be focused . under rever@@ ting you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : one image is too cold . the solution , the picture is a little soft to draw . use the tool for sof@@ ten@@ ing with the menu entry cor@@ rigi@@ ble sof@@ ing and experiment something with settings . the fore@@ front on the right of the dialog gives you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter is bl@@ ur@@ red and is a very good tool to remove v@@ eil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help the image process . the fore@@ front shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the standard values often create good results and should first be tried out . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you create the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness mask , smo@@ kers and the impression of Gr@@ ates close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents one how many pixels on each side of a channel by the filter are affected . high resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . you should therefore take pictures at best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the twi@@ sted picture one of the original is added to the original . this becomes the strength of shar@@ pen@@ ing .
&quot; the sw@@ elling value is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference level . it can thereby be used for a channel of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen , and therefore avoided fl@@ aw in faces , cel@@ ing and water @-@ surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red wr@@ apping filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool re@@ focused on an image by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copyright protected by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to get an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . he uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ing . we can start creating better results as a bl@@ ur@@ red mask . you can launch it from the menu by drawing colors Re@@ focused in the image processing .
&quot; in practice the circular base is working much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which indicates the mathematical result of the original pixel , which is far from original pixel rate . the F@@ IR of the Gau@@ ge &apos;s circuit is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular base . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures should the default value 1 good results . you can put a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red but then on Heiligen@@ sch@@ eine .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help to reduce art@@ e@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.95 and date . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ p@@ tive effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filters : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ e@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful . however , values are higher than 0.1 . however , the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still further poll@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ge &apos;s Sch@@ är@@ fe . use this parameter if your in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness is caused . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ yed art@@ e@@ facts . if you have a value un@@ equal zero , so you might have to increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ ive filter . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ as size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ers . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially when you choose big values for the circular archipelago or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s Sch@@ är@@ fe . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the stor@@ ing as and charging buttons are used exactly for that purpose . each of any reaction parameters you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try all the cutting , color and int@@ ric@@ ability correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture in any other way . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible are left , but later un@@ pleasant art@@ e@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compres@@ sed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ cot produces better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused to bl@@ ur the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king as a shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , you need to bl@@ ur visual mas@@ ks always cause arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of shar@@ p@@ ness . for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal lin@@ e@@ are filter . practical is the result of the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better than the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR filter filter is often better in the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small focused image , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was taken with an analog camera . the focused result is due to insufficient light for the car @-@ focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing correction in digital models , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; the regul@@ ator runs the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of the area of the dark@@ ened , in order to create a natural embarrass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the color tin@@ ent allows a customized colour for p@@ up@@ ille . in case you want blue eyes rather than dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the instrument &apos;s imag@@ inary tract is one of the most advanced tool to remove not the desired arti@@ facts with un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the In@@ corpor@@ algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ or in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre @-@ settings as starter to simplify the restoration . the available settings are below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a steady smo@@ othing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be kept for details that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be necessary . please note that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; straight@@ ener alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es equal in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you create a high value w@@ oven pattern . JP@@ EG art@@ e@@ facts are best combined with a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all . put this value therefore fitting to the degree of smoking in your picture . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ lets , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : can be run as many times the algorithm . normally there is 1 or 2 out of the algorithm .
&quot; angle @-@ sided side da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha is small chosen , it should also be small to generate a long term . you should therefore choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to suit your needs . &quot;
&quot; integrated circuit page &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated treasures in pixels . you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid Sub @-@ pixels gl@@ omer@@ ation and never exceed 2 . &quot;
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the superior quality that you can receive by selecting this option is only small but the run time . we therefore recommend him to leave it out .
buttons Save as and charging make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and later be rechar@@ ged .
image errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . it can however still take a long time and take a high CPU load after yourself . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button @-@ off .
below you can see how sc@@ oring with a little arti@@ facts might be corrected . the module is used on a photo that was applied in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black screen during the journey is wor@@ del@@ .@@ The original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; Rau@@ ti@@ tes is a very powerful tool to decrease sc@@ ars . it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter available , to remove spots and other art@@ e@@ facts which can occur e.g. by dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor feet from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ ents ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on sens@@ ory cameras from digital cameras , so you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screenshot above shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a bo@@ iled spac@@ ing that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filters are used per pixel and can equi@@ p the image via the radius and the color in it becomes exposed and thus lower errors .
&quot; shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the noise level . this value is laying down the pixel rate . if it is increased to adjust the channel filter . you may need to change the edges filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details do not get more and smo@@ kers or lubric@@ ation occurs again . &quot;
&quot; channel : controls the cant@@ onal accuracy of the filter . if it is greatly improving the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , cannot remove the entire pre@@ dat@@ ors or smo@@ e@@ ads . put it on a value near the maxim@@ ism if you want to remove a narrow smoke or JP@@ EG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ous intoler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the gl@@ omer@@ ation process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the colour toler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you either paint or lumin@@ ance to change one image . these settings do not affect the gl@@ omer@@ ation process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
&quot; GAMMA @-@ RAY controls the gam@@ mat@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically typically tend to increase . it is also poll@@ uted also the sh@@ atten@@ de@@ areas . &quot;
&quot; da@@ mping : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ ey@@ mo@@ ck@@ ery . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increasing , the edges can occur . if he can occur on his minimum , can be ro@@ de and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter to occur in the edges . he can be pre@@ dat@@ ed and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save and loading : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for smoking reduction , which you have set , can be saved into the file system and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how pre@@ valence of life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) , and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the pre@@ valence has been applied with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cold for your purpose . the solution , the picture a little soft to shar@@ pen , is fortunately much easier than an image to shar@@ pen , and experiment with the Gl@@ ät@@ te . the fore@@ front on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo sho@@ ots .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ e@@ facts by your images . it is very well adapted to immerse yourself in digital , original or thought@@ ful digit@@ alized images in digital , original or thought@@ ful digit@@ alized images , which makes the content as well as the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ tures , which has been performed with a different tool , the artwork . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ or in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts cut : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of compres@@ sed compres@@ sed instruments , he creates some compression &amp; quot ; - small standards that are in the un@@ compres@@ sed picture . this attitude should correct this problems . &quot;
the buttons saved as and charging make exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can hereby be saved into a text file and later be rechar@@ ged .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load after yourself . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with a mark@@ er smo@@ ker . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera was recorded with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous fil@@ ming on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures was reduced to an old colour photo that was caused by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool Hot@@ photo permits it Hot@@ photo of photos which were with a CCD camera gem , eight were to remove . it uses the algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ stop . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixel are particularly in high @-@ quality raw mode pictures a problem , since many cameras with JP@@ EG compression about a built @-@ in repression for hot pixel . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel ) ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel ) ; there is currently no manual method to choose the bad pixel . &quot;
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button @-@ screen . the tool will recognize automatic the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark picture directly in connection to explore new hot or bright pixels by CCD defect . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous paragraph , you should invite the right @-@ image to correc@@ ting image . an automatic processing of the dark picture is shown the bad pixel . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically load this automatically in the next meeting . &quot;
the image area and the preview will help you correct the results within the image . the fore@@ front shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all lectures .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ish these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ an : it is determined an average of the neighboring countries . the resulting colour will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is separately made for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 from pixel block to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish pixels in the block to inter@@ pol@@ ish .
square : this is the standard filter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drag@@ ged to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the pixels in the block .
&quot; Cub@@ an : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be cur@@ ated to calculate a bi @-@ k@@ ub@@ ian surface ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) , or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) which then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish pixels in the block to inter@@ pol@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ line correction on a shade , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; Vign@@ et@@ ting Cor@@ rection is a tool to correct the Vign@@ et@@ ting , i.e. short@@ cut corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; further objective , particularly in the middle and big photo format , often the entire sensor range is not uni@@ form@@ ly illuminated . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ Obj@@ ectives also demonstrate this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in aper@@ ture filters , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . fores@@ ight lenses , also with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise inev@@ it@@ ant effects arise by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large covering areas of today &apos;s filters and the shade of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation at a raw image that has been applied without this filter . the tool Vign@@ et@@ ting correc@@ tions used the transformation with a Center@@ filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
with three controllers you can control the vig@@ or correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of lumin@@ osity on the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , what a optical filter by 2 , entsp@@ ils . Incre@@ asing the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ or reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the Edit of an image with the in@@ vig@@ or correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixel . you must re@@ configure the exposure of the target image with these options . the controller will only have to provide positive values as you can only increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a refin@@ ement of the target image , so let the values for illumin@@ ating / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ came ; artwork from the menu color Gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vig@@ or correction of a picture applied . the original image ( 1 ) shows the labels in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a Leu@@ ch@@ ased ke@@ - and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; Lin@@ ked distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical l@@ enti@@ ls to photos . it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colour@@ ing distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gr@@ ades treats the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ ise form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third Gr@@ ades has a similar round effect , fl@@ att@@ ened , but in the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth Gr@@ ades corrected the remote corners opposite to the second crest . if you combine these two can be eliminated every geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second Gr@@ ades . with negative values can be corrected using t@@ onn@@ o @-@ shaped distor@@ tions and positive values c@@ iences .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth Gr@@ ades . this value acts more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ enti@@ ls the &apos; corners Parameter the inver@@ ted occurrence of the parameter General .
zoom : this value scal@@ ates the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first Gr@@ ades through . negative values enlarge during positive the image .
&quot; bright : this value is adjust the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filtering settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; t@@ onn@@ aise or c@@ unning correction should be carried out above all fe@@ eder or size changes . at best perform this correction than all the first through . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a t@@ onn@@ et correction would be the effect of inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction . move the mouse pointer to display lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ aise / c@@ iences c@@ lock@@ out with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a c@@ oo@@ ked distor@@ tion , the resulting image black corners will have . you can transform this with the cutting tool in the menu , cut off the editing or via the Zoom Reg@@ ulations of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most images the t@@ onn@@ o correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives such as shots from the front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective to correct that all angles at the picture 90 degrees . keep in mind that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always keep an easy distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of t@@ onn@@ et correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org website that can be reached using this URL . the filter re@@ produced the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window you can choose the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview allows you to adjust two parameters of film sites and screening excit@@ ability ( ISO ) . the ISO controller changes the amount of film bask@@ ets and domin@@ ance of the color Green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green fields are white as snow !
&quot; since the filter colour channels used to reproduce of infrared movie , especially the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , since the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ ming applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the he@@ aters .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter Film gr@@ itt is an easy to use tool to reproduce movies on your images , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of films by the manufacturers of the photo manufacturers of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film put@@ ted effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere dis@@ solved in daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , str@@ assen@@ photographic , intimate sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller it can be ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the Kör@@ ner calibr@@ ated . the default value is , although often higher values need to be installed on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more bask@@ ets , so you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the film images applied to a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and that worked ( 2 ) . I used film @-@ sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected legal algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter oil gem@@ äl@@ de gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature images and lac@@ tation are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controllers to influence this effect . the top choos@@ es the brush size between one and five out . thick@@ er brushes are better for large images . smooth , controlled the smo@@ othing or , from the other side looked like the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is characterized by ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter coal drawing is used colour and int@@ ens@@ ability to generate a Koh@@ l@@ ance in drawing . it &apos;s helpful , if you would like to imagine which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to start . &quot;
&quot; there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top reg@@ ler choos@@ es the stit@@ ch size and the sub@@ ordin@@ ates the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the label extension . the original image ( 1 ) , and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjustment of the value . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter gra@@ ving your image into 3 @-@ D as if it was cut into wax . it uses a copyrighted algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , in order to transform the image into a gray @-@ coloured landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to set the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filtering . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filtering group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of distor@@ ting se@@ ff@@ les . it is used by protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : shares the picture in cells and makes it look like it is considered by gl@@ aze .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to the wav@@ e@@ ets 1 will f@@ lown the picture here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects at any time with the button .
with this filtering group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of shar@@ p@@ ness effects . it is used by protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ pen : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image along ster@@ n@@ ested lines going out of a center . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ ring the picture by rotation of the pixels around a centre . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a swi@@ vel camera .
remove the image to generate the effect of a not focused camera body . the object appears to be back in the background .
&quot; free movement of motion , the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear motion , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera . &quot;
soft@@ ness non@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : the picture soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amer and glos@@ sy soft focus effects ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic por@@ traits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to adding a warm and subtle bulbs . &quot;
sh@@ red@@ ly bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ ur@@ ring the picture by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of an arbitr@@ ary movable camera .
intelligent in@@ shar@@ pen : finds the paint bas@@ ins in the image and caught this without the rest .
mos@@ ai@@ c : shares the photo in rectangular cells and creates it then by filling with an average pixel rate .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to control shelves to your image . this makes it natural your images a n@@ asses look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by protected algorithm .
&quot; dro@@ pl@@ et size allows to change the size of the drop . since the dro@@ pl@@ et size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and the density of the drop . fish changes the optical effects of the drop in the image . &quot;
&quot; you can keep up with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing an area of free from rain drops . use the choice -@@ tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should be free to stay free . if you start the filter shelves the area will be free of rain . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ular Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can get it through mir@@ rors or turning in the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers or transform the mir@@ rors . &quot;
photo bl@@ aze is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to res@@ ized is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture zo@@ oming ? how can you find the missing information here ? how can you find the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here . try him and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . select the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change the size uses a linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for bl@@ oss@@ om . &quot;
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation for example Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo lo@@ wer@@ f was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ or in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the input of the new size is retained the original aspect of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ lies , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons saved as and charging are exactly used . each inser@@ tion for photo enlarge can be saved as a text file and can be rechar@@ ged .
photo bl@@ aze is very fast at what it makes but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load after yourself . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example of photo bl@@ oss@@ om by adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magnific@@ ation to compare .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to compile an image . the mouse simply allows you to create a photo with the mouse , through pressing the mouse button and pull the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle then you will move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you get rid of the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . thus you will get a good overview of your photo after cutting down . you can create the size of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by clicking on it simply with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting section , use the button @-@ button the access button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file saving and file saving using the menu file to save the new image . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains . &quot;
&quot; in the tool to cut aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned to the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you are cen@@ timeters , in@@ ach or some other physical size . you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their side @-@ aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to refresh the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertical .
&quot; in the dialog box , you can set the area for access to the maximum possible depending on the size and orientation , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically ) . if you use the cutting tool for the next time , these settings are shown as standard values in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the joint assistance allow assistance to bl@@ ending help , so that you can put your pictures better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ reg@@ ains , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a way to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the di@@ agon@@ als . &quot;
Golden Center : the golden centre is one division the split into different natural growth patterns like e.g. the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shells or the flo@@ wering leaves of a sun@@ flower . it emerg@@ es in all kinds of things that we find as nice .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number of 180@@ 180@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used in ancient Egyptians and Greeks that surrounds your tem@@ ples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photographs to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number after 1 equal the sum of their two sets is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that this rule is followed as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden middle represents liquid relief lines when you put a picture . these help are squee@@ zed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results to achieve better results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ reg@@ ains that creates a liquid spiral that leads the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
&quot; a further rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angle . it should be something that the eye is in the center of the composition . it should be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden triangle also direct from the top of the golden spiral , the middle points of the sides of golden triangle , golden tri@@ angles can be found in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ als to place these lines can be placed a static object of dynam@@ ical . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame or create a effect of a professional photographers &apos; dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your image asset to one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other way .
the options horizont@@ ally reflect and ver@@ tically mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic ponds .
with the button color you can put the color of the assistance lines . in case you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current picture .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture to any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to hold the camera not exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are shot . you can check this with the &amp; digi@@ tization . you can transform this free rot@@ ation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
turn your image with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button settings you can set the slide back to 0 degree . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right top .
&quot; for your help , the Module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse pointer to position the two lines . now you can fix it on an important point of the picture . now , adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix it is to transform the function transform@@ ations to use of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . take note of the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tive transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ mentioned reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that can help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area .
angle left down : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after the adjustment of the perspective the image will be a little bit poll@@ uted . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after you get the perspective you will get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to ob@@ ber@@ some it is the image with transform cutting from the image processing .
&quot; the sim@@ ulator is used to move a part of the image into a direction and move the other part to the opposite side . this is no rotation , the picture becomes shif@@ ted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is shif@@ ted into a Parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can start this module through transform@@ ers . &quot;
sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizont@@ als angle and the vertical angle . you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time . you can preview the angle on zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the screen .
&quot; for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after having completed the sh@@ ear , the picture is a bit sc@@ ared for this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sh@@ avers have twice as much dou@@ bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after the sh@@ ear the image has a beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transform@@ ations from the image processing .
&quot; and digi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the species such as these libraries comp@@ iling . in most distribu@@ tions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all the file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F below . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ came ; shows only files in formats to know . this happens through the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions . it can be accepted . in the section configuration you will find further information on this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras will even allow you to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats you can find in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compres@@ sion@@ ing on digital images . this enables redund@@ ant information to store the image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , gl@@ atter@@ e results as JP@@ EG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be st@@ air @-@ free if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw format format , so you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the pipe converter from &amp; digi@@ came ; in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ came ; supports the loading of raw models only with the program d@@ cra@@ p , which is supported in &amp; digi@@ tization . all support cameras can see below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are supported by &amp; digi@@ came ; &quot;
many digital cameras also support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . it &apos;s not a film @-@ working program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to view movies or editing . if you click on a film file and you will have no built @-@ in possibilities to use movies to play movies to play the program for playing .
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .

all configur@@ ated cameras are stored here . you can use the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please check the camera after further information .
K@@ IP@@ I module combines a series of pictures in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth .
&quot; if you exchange steps 4 and 5 exchange what you can do well when the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjusting entries with the white module . &quot;
many tools you need the photo machining are in &amp; digi@@ came ; contain your description follows here .
&quot; all educational tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , pre@@ valent , re@@ focused , and etc ; . use a single dialogue type which shows the effect in a preview before the filter appears in a preview before the filter appears on the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture an@@ wen@@ den@@ quot ; in this dialogue : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . links from it allow five buttons to change the compar@@ isons of the incident . these modes are :
ver@@ tically share without dup@@ lic@@ at . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the chosen preview .
horizont@@ ally share without dup@@ lic@@ at . the upper area shows the original and the lower displays the filter applied to the range below the chosen preview .
vertical divide . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the sight , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch off to display over and lower exposure . used colors can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and drop in the part of the picture from which you want to preview . the preview in the left part of dialogue will be updated immediately .
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the lower left corner , here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your standard values . all settings from the last use of the module will be painted . &quot;
the side bar features displays the essential information about the selected picture and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters in shoot the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
&quot; this rider provides an intuitive ticket tool based on the mar@@ ble @-@ mini program . click C@@ trl ; lin@@ ker mouse button to drag a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this is of course , one of course pre@@ dat@@ ed that your images entered by Ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit shades and to choose and use colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and load @-@ used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , they can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files . &quot;
the cursor is shown in the pall@@ et view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color in addition . the color is described under the pall@@ et view . here also the colour name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose . in order to produce such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor . then move the mouse with the pressing lin@@ ker mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the An@@ kreu@@ z Bei@@ m cursor is inserted under the button , inserted the color from the paint plate on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected . this mode can be set by selecting the starter box under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the promotions , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the parts of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a pointer signal . if another color follows . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; color edit . &quot;
the colours in the palette and the output of the colours can be drawn with the mouse .
you can choose a color somewhere on the screen and then can be found in the paint selection on the left .
&quot; &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; these programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science , especially in science , especially in computer science ; includes , according to the view of the program author , the program name &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; this project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program .
&amp; F@@ graphical Viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ ically ; -@@ dot ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ programs in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; present the graphs and presented in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or open the graphs in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in one &amp; K@@ ate ; -@@ component to open
loading of great graphs ( currently there are problems from around 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to enlarge more than these knots )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ id ; -@@ program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graphs will be required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the open Grap@@ h , each in an own sub@@ window . at the beginning , if you create &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer : without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screens . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screenshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is shown if the graph is bigger than the character . you can select a fixed location in this list , or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse wheel is used ( high and r@@ under without special @-@ keys , left and right by pressing &amp; alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of graphs .
&quot; if the file was changed in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re @-@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer : your decision may also change , you can set your decision later , you can set the menu item settings to set up ... see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph@@ ite outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or in the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ instance , or to set the lad@@ der graphs in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can permanently save your choice , but also change it with the dialog dialog . &quot;
&quot; during the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also set how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs are to be fitted to a page , the page ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
print page with one or more pages distributed without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the page again charging is the possibility to set the behaviour when a file is changed on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a standard be@@ aming ( automatically re@@ load or delete the changes ) or the program of every time . &quot;
&quot; the page opening gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer , if a graph outside of an ongoing meeting will be opened ( the graphs in a new window or set in a sub@@ window of already running session ) or determine that each time is consult@@ ed . &quot;
the page seating management gives the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if you wish to be asked for every start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opening further options : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ ou@@ tal@@ g@@ ashe@@ ets . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; algorithm , the default for judicial graphs . he produces hierarch@@ ical or lamin@@ ated depic@@ tions of judicial graphs . the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then tries to produce as short edges and as little edges possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for un@@ just graphs . it produces represent@@ ations in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ board model . thus , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai algorithm is used , the equivalent is with statisti@@ c several dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ ed graphics model -@@ layout . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ sh@@ ake de@@ emer for the treatment of large and g@@ ec@@ lu@@ ster@@ ns Grap@@ h .
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm render the no@@ des in a circular section according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cy@@ c@@ lical structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of graphs after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format may give you &amp; eg ; the graph gives special options , or even the graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determined the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ just ) and applied the standard algorithms for the respective type on ( dot ; for bit@@ ration &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ covered graphs ) .
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed unless this is needed . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; displays the What is the mouse pointer to you . click with this mouse pointer to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get further help to this item ( if available ) . &quot;
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the basic folder of the source repository .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows to add GPS co @-@ ordin@@ ates to the metad@@ ata of an image and edit . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF samples of the image and the loc@@ alisation can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation provides tools available for pictures geograph@@ ically in spher@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
&quot; to track your images with geographical data , you need a GPS trace as XML @-@ file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Geo@@ graphic localization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to switch cor@@ rel@@ ing in the main window and call the menu on . the top to visual dialogue appears then . to load a possible cor@@ relation of time and loc@@ alisation . this file , of course , you must download a sp@@ ur@@ file with GP@@ X file , such as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
if the file is loaded a automatic cor@@ relation carried out the coordinates in red an@@ displays . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera will be done with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
the adjustment for the maximum period deviation gives a high deviation for the GPS time and camera @-@ up . lies the deviation of the data . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds will then take all the images in this field .
&quot; options Inter@@ pol@@ ish and difference in min. can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a local difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relation to inter@@ pol@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful , if you need a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the localization can also be found and set up with the indicated map and enlarge . select this in the appropriate area and enlarge it again . the height can always be selected manually . the map can always be manually selected between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the exi@@ ft@@ ool uses to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages con@@ form to version 4.01 . you can select the albums which can be exported as HTML pages and set the parameters for the HTML pages . the string will be U@@ TF @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the tab has four rider in which the tab can choose . the tab allows you to choose all the albums . you will quickly choose a large number of albums . in the area , below you will quickly appear a large number of albums and the text that will appear in the head of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . this tab is largely explan@@ atory . the option for each image will also be created . if you then click on a picture , the picture will display directly with your standard picture , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related images . select a folder on which you have writing . a sub@@ folder containing the name of K@@ IP@@ I@@ AS export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
with other color depth you can change the default depth . the influences of course also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
&quot; the tab gives you some of the settings from the album tab for the preview images , which are small images shown in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window indicates the user on how far the action is . press release to break down the process .
&quot; when the module is created , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore also read the programs that occurred during the production line . the web browser will be started automatically at the end to display the preview of the gallery . press closing around the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I imaging is a very fast and flexible OpenGL tool @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I imaging enables it to look at a selection of pictures and to perform on them basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or duplication . the viewer can be used for a quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
after the start a picture by default will be displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG distributed air @-@ free module is a tool to change images without your quality .
&quot; this module allows for saving the actions listed below , images in JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses for quality or metad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the out@@ flow storage is that the file size rises , since there is no compression of the color information . this can be found e.g. in PN@@ G format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera clim@@ ber is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import -@@ function of the metad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . you can then copy the file sel@@ ector with which you want to copy the target option . thus , the image to which you want to copy the metad@@ ata . the data will be copied after you click the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check out the exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can add a basic image file of MP@@ 2 or WAV der slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are scal@@ able to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can create a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can only use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you first need to packed the images into the MPEG slideshow . then you can start using the extras MPEG slideshow .
the pictures selected by you are then under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sor@@ ting of the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format may be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pres@@ et and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds the picture shown below is set . a lower value creates a sudden , high on the contrary , very smooth image change . &quot;
the back@@ color can be set as next . in doubt you should let them black . the name and the path of the generated file you can specify under the name of the MPEG output file . keep up as the en@@ su@@ mp@@ g as possible .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of audio source file , then this will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can catch the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can drink a coffee or drink a coffee if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Packages via the button below . &quot;
the wiz@@ ard wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet paper along with standard pictures . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve your or with the Gimp module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your recorded image stored in one of three formats , JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line utility d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original purpose of Him is : you expect from d@@ cra@@ p not that there are the same results generated as the software from your camera , sometimes get better results ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the raw file the converted file and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then be displayed in the mode for a single picture . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now re@@ configure the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for the whit@@ eboard . the key parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal you can proceed to the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a quarter of the GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains equal and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a rejuven@@ ating algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , T@@ IF@@ F , keeps all the information of your image and uses the losses @-@ free LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; in case you are going to process your pictures frequently or you do not later use the JP@@ EG format , because it &apos;s just a limited number of operations before the image quality is deter@@ ior@@ ated . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as storage format , the metad@@ ata contained in the raw file is stored in the JP@@ EG file in the 68@@ EC file . &quot;
&quot; if you have customized your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , you can use this process . &quot;
&quot; the st@@ ack@@ able mode allows you to convert various images to once . use this mode for instance , e.g. by testing an individual image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , here the possibility of existing file will automatically over@@ write . this is helpful if it is not available in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . the progress bar is not available as far the conversion continues . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in one record . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can put the pre@@ fix , the start@@ number and the time stamps should be used . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a image collection . it is used to convert the program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can create the image smaller or enlarge . these are four types of image modification made available :
&quot; proportional to 1 dam . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , according to the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportion@@ ate ( 2 den@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
&quot; dis@@ proportion@@ ate , dis@@ proportion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option . &quot;
&quot; printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures previously . for more images can draw on the list of the pictures and place there .
&quot; after which you started the module , the pictures will be displayed with the pictures selected by you . you can add additional pictures with a file sel@@ ections . for the last selected picture the image will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag and add pictures to the picture list and add them to the list of the images .
&quot; with the button pictures , the selected images will be removed from the list of the pictures . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all pictures , you can open the new message using the button OK to open your e @-@ mail clients . you only need to add the addresses and the operator . the pictures selected by you are already attached to the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
pay attention to many pictures at once . most of the e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of the e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every time uses until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify in the input field including the correct path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ mail@@ Agent on your computer before . you can download it here . &quot;
after the selection of comments in a attached file you will add comments to the images into a text file and attached to the mail .
&quot; PN@@ G format below the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it &apos;s best adapted to the encrypted formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use PN@@ G , if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you to JP@@ EG format . &quot;
if you choose JP@@ EG using pictures file format and the original files in JP@@ EG format are then the original @-@ Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the pictures .
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so you can start out the status tests in search of errors . your e @-@ mail programme will automatically start at the end . with the button closing , you can finish this window t@@ lie ? en . &quot;
after starting the module advanced slideshow appears a window with questions like you want to have shown your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
&quot; the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation will use very elegant picture outputs by OpenGL . however , you will have to possess a corresponding graphic card because otherwise the slideshow is very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option displays that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the v@@ eil ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end loop . you can then switch manually with es@@ c ; break down .
the option pictures random@@ ly ensures that the pictures are shown in a random order . so it will not be used in order of images in the album .
&quot; in delay between the pictures , the tempor@@ al distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ econ@@ ds meet 1,5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends upon your computer and the chosen transi@@ tional effect . you should watch this so before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly choose between the images a different effect .
during the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off .
&quot; with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start the presentation , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current data entry , the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; dates currently regul@@ ating currently has no documentation . in case you are interested in writing this . please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool to put an image as wallpaper for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your KDE working surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image are now available in every group , so in persons , places and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories , for which you have provided information as you have your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to view to the EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current preview pictures . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose another person , only the images are shown on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method , you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few single pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view the images to see the images of your working range . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person has its own pre @-@ painting image , this also applies to places , key@@ word , and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button which is right outside on the toolbar . you have the advantage that you can view the view for each category . this has the advantage that you can see for example symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to set yourself what image should be displayed for each individual person . now , you have to see the picture @-@ in Window ( in closer described ) , you have to customize the picture below for your wishes and select which part of the image should be shown and cut . &quot;
&quot; when you access the header section , you will display a dialog which is very similar to the dialog box for setting the image properties . this dialog can be seen at the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string in the field or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images be sear@@ ched for this text , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data as for example 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom of the window you can browse all pictures of certain names , as you can see in the picture . here will be shown in pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and look at the quick entry , the screenshot and the introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or choose the menu help menu . click here , some examples of pictures loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a continuous HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . one image of this bar you can see here : . as the name tells you , this ly@@ ust shows you data statistics on the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute episodes . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can be found in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date is displayed in the preview ( displayed ) and also displays the current date of the currently shown pictures , when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of the time bar by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so you can select a range , you will be able to select the selection by clicking on a beam of the time bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version you can create via the menu file HTML ...
&quot; before HTML pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
first enter the title of the bli@@ cks and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created on the overview page . nutritional information about export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can choose which information on the HTML pages are to be shown . so you can avoid that all pictures of a party are . please note that all pictures of a party are . please note that all pictures are exported . you can therefore use this setting not to hide certain images from certain viewer . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how to look the HTML pages . most settings options are un@@ ambiguous , which is why it is not specifically formulated . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can configure different resolutions for the pictures . therefore , those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that has the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no pictures have the possibility to download a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time , so you can specify your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer time , as if he wants to show a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setup area , you place the different folders and the URL to where your website is stored . &quot;
most of you choose a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
&quot; first of all , you have to select the main folder where all your images will be saved . this folder will be automatically saved and select for all future pictures of the location . here you can either select a folder or a KDE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check whether these really are all for viewers to choose a URL after the pages were created . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you don &apos;t have to manually copy them into the final destination folder , see , correctly you must specify the final target of files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders . &quot;
the settings described here are all three to basic folders and URLs . in these sub@@ folders created a sub@@ folder whose name you specify in output folder .
&quot; if you &apos;re looking at a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images . if you have already taken a HTML page for viewing the images , then you must take with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not even be done . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are thereby imported and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they distinguish themselves whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or whether in the file you can find a link to the file that you can share all pictures and share this file as independent . the obvious disadvantage is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im files either directly from the menu file ex@@ porting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the images in two @-@ fold way . first , the pictures are not found , so the pictures of the URL you have indicated in creating the HTML files , this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog is described for the export of pictures that you can call over the menu file ex@@ porting ... &quot;
the main option of this dialog is whether to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . it is possible to provide you with the following three choices :
with the manual Manu@@ el to copy the .@@ k@@ im file you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have already been compres@@ sed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small . if you do not want to comp@@ ress the files so you simply choose the option ex@@ porting file .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you want to send your friends pictures , since the .@@ k@@ im -@@ file would be very large . here you can limit the size by example , that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File import ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it can be that you can person@@ alize the category individuals of imported file ( if you are a sw@@ ans ) , while this category should be imported in the third dialog box , which are to be imported in the third dialog box , which are to be imported in the third dialog box , and which categories will comply with them in your database . &quot;
the fourth step allows you to import the categories of the data imported into the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
&quot; it must be simple to browse pictures and watch : if you see images , one often want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all pictures in which this friend is depic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information about your pictures , over ( 2 ) the passage and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation possibilities . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it was enlarged and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this book will be spoken about pictures , but frequently it also closes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all his information in the file cm@@ x@@ ml at the top folder of their images . this is an easy XML file that you can backup on a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; noted the folder where your images are stored and used in future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to start a different database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you can start a different database tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; about the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; they set up to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , you will be explained in the following section of the user interface . &quot;
&quot; left you see six different symbols , with which you can view adjustment possibilities and options for the viewer . for each setting you can access the F1 button on the F1 button , and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; in which you describe how you can define for each image different properties , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like e.g. objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; on display the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub @-@ categories were mentioned earlier . in dialog options you can set up complete members groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group are directed at once in a group instead of all groups of an average membership . &quot;
&quot; in view the settings options available , which can be available to you for the fixed selection list . with the above listed selection list , you can configure the category you want to configure . in the left Fen@@ st@@ erh@@ aus there is a list with the current category and in the right one list of the categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ ti@@ at and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . for more information please visit the homepage from Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , but are separately distributed . most modules have a help page that you can call on the module itself . &quot;
&quot; as the modules used by several applications can be shared with each other , it may be tested that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo version . therefore , you can either access the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . say not , I would not have war@@ ned it ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , thus making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for several modules the order after albums so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; thereby sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture @-@ show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; apart from the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here , there is a photo@@ album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you set in the dialogue dialog as a category for virtual albums , i.e. , for example , use the category persons , will do a photo@@ album , so if you would have chosen people to view and share this module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and choose in the area modules that are to be loaded into the modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example for a starting screen as soon as you get &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used from any other KDE application , you can see the window with which you can see your image database . currently , there is not much information about your pictures . in the section we will show you back on this window , now please click on this window to show you an overview with all existing pictures . &quot;
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . these include information about the persons who are included on the picture . you can put any picture on either single or for a larger number of pictures certain notes at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per was pic@@ tured and all pictures in Copenhagen have been included .
&quot; all these comments can be used for downloading and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these comments when you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in view three lists with a text box by identifying people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the moving of images within the list : if you have pic@@ tured for example a family party and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can therefore find that the used names are moved upwards to find the persons faster and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see a liter@@ acy list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have any remarks on each picture individually , you might want to edit all selected images and provided these pictures with ann@@ ot@@ ations . then click in this case simply on the front and back buttons , which are under the preview of the image to the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a comment . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . moreover , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the United States as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the An@@ ven@@ ing dial@@ ogs , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new Over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also make an entry simply to a category and drop there to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically sort . see it . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the item of dial@@ ogs by clicking the bar that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move it into a separate window by setting it out of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame also completely out . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and here then window a / bl@@ ending . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will find an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you have no filter here . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of the th@@ umb@@ nails , by simply plug@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it easily . &quot;
&quot; if you have an image on the background of your desktop , this picture is furnished as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , this in the picture is shown . if you have not opened a window with a picture , a new display is created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the picture gallery , simply select the appropriate images from you and click on the Edit button or select the Edit selection . now you will display the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . of course , you can also use the images anywhere , so you can record the pictures somewhere else . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can view all required pictures from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images where the right upper left is cut down , are not stored on your hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the preview images are available , so you can view the preview of these images . however , you can also view these images with the picture . &quot;
&quot; as you see this function that you want to copy files from folders and again copy . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . if you want to avoid the record of your images , please purchase a larger drive to save all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy you want to stay in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also view all pictures that you may see for others and select the menu entry everything except current view . &quot;
&quot; with this you have specified which images will be hidden in case of the case . if you want to enter the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , allowing all the pictures you want to be locked out . if you want to see the pictures again , click on Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered to un@@ locking the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this image protection is by no means very secure . for one , all pictures on the hard disk and another can access the password as in@@ conclusi@@ ve text or delete it . this type of password protection serves only to those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it , of course , you want to look at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has to look at some point . this is why you can preview it from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . it shows of course the image , but additional all the information you have to enter on the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box is shown on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily move using the mouse and why you can configure which information will be displayed and whether or all these options are available after a legal click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on the browser , see the suitable entries to this display . if you want to view all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can jump between them and go back by jump the keys picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slideshow album . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it can press a new image by typ@@ ing the Str@@ g button and Plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful capacity of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can catch into the picture in the picture and pull out . with the mouse button you can simply drag the Plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not converted . with the uni@@ formity , the zo@@ oms puts the zoom so that each of the pixel is equal to the screen of a pixel . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work with videos that start in and out with the Plus@@ - and Minu@@ et key .
with the screen@@ shots from the context menu you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you can view images it may happen that you may have a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view this name and enter configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . you will perhaps prefer to mark the picture and to see more pictures .
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer , to view the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you see one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above there is the viewer to provide you with the viewer , while you see them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the respective letters . in view a picture , where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set characteristics on your images , you can watch them in your browser . so you can easily edit it . this is described in . then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and particularly characteristics can be displayed in the preview image , then you can add characteristics to the pictures by simply press the letters for the short@@ cut after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can switch off your cham@@ ois later . &quot;
in you can see an image on the painted . to switch on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select on the picture painting from the context menu . to finish the painting in the toolbar top at the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to operate the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you have to be read and understood . &quot;
in the object of the object you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the properties tab and the object described in the wir@@ es - views yellow .
&quot; you can also choose several objects simultaneously . but not the sub @-@ object of an already chosen object , since all the objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following set @-@ up menu appears , so you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with delet@@ ing either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click An@@ gle to take these changes . have you invali@@ d values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can click on the input error or to turn the changes with cr@@ acking . &quot;
&quot; in case you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the dialog dialog , you can view the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the object shown with help . &quot;
&quot; you do need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a text or part of a text , you can preview a preview in the peculi@@ ar view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the peculi@@ ar view and a small example of the scene is structured with the chosen texture . as a pres@@ et@@ ting , the entire texture is structured , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ( for example a text inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross the locally . &quot;
the screenshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the centre of sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shif@@ ting . you can change the shift through drag with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a wire model a view of view . you can specify this value relative to the point of view of the higher level of level or as absolute value . objects will only appear , if they are selected or their visibility in the toolbar selected by the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as a pres@@ et@@ ting . the object @-@ tree and the view of the properties tab are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window of window , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them as desired . you can also save several shut@@ ters and easily switch between different approaches . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a present view , drag the beginnings to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the start to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the beg@@ inner to another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cart@@ on top of the views above . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window of window are p@@ ending views : views , which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the window to the desktop or click the small to the left top @-@ line arrow in the board bar . &quot;
&quot; to view a view , click on the small cross in the board bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any type of views . new views are sch@@ web@@ end , you can anchor them at any point . &quot;
the current window display can store you with view shut@@ downs ... it will display a dialog in which you can save the window frames under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be properly installed . as this hand@@ book was written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
to ren@@ dering the current scene click on the icon Ren@@ dering The icon Ren@@ ders in the toolbar or select the menu entry scene .
&quot; a R@@ ender mode matches the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . he determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want a scene in different dimensions and quality levels , you can use any number of R@@ ender @-@ modes , from a quick preview of up to full pictures in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon of The R@@ ender settings in the toolbar or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog is opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the lower image . if you only want to ren@@ dering a small area of the image , select the cross @-@ section sub@@ section and enter the image section of the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination @-@ field quality , you can choose the properties which is used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for Ren@@ ders used . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user refl@@ ections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user Guide to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; when a picture comes with only a beam of pixels , there are often different bugs . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or mar@@ gins effects in cur@@ ves and lines , in addition , sometimes details are not shown if they are in the representation of smaller than one pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . in general you can see pictures of this feature better .
&quot; if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of great sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive method ; adap@@ tive because the second method is adap@@ tive to the adjacent pixels ; recur@@ sively , because every pixel is continuously being split again and adap@@ tive because the records of calculated colours depend . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray exce@@ eds a beam of pixels . if the difference between the colour values compared to the neigh@@ bou@@ ts , then both pixels being calculated by following a specific additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling , then a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be charged at a lowering of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values , the thres@@ hold thres@@ hold , then the pixels being pursued further and checked for further classification . the maximum depth of the record can be set up with the lowering . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of smo@@ kers for the Str@@ apping process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to regular sample . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; that diff@@ use diff@@ use clear@@ ing . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
on this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixels is then transparent when the associated rays have no object .
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Con@@ sole Output . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expected , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file import ... and select a file from the dialog box .
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ post v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command cat@@ ching of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and when import@@ ing error messages or al@@ arms occur , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support sources in &amp; k@@ post v@@ model@@ er ; then please write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object ma@@ st@@ ree in the editor to import the source text of the object into the open text file in the editor , simply highlight the source code in the editor and drag him to the object . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert HTML @-@ text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ amed . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on assistance in the peculi@@ arity view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user docum@@ entations for shown object . put here the path to your docum@@ ent@@ ment and the version . support the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you are entering files that are not in the folder of the scene , you will also have to list the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first one file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for display of selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the case for the view in the camera view and in the window type marks .
&quot; you can adjust the item of the points on the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model views . you can here set the R@@ aster separate for shif@@ ting , sc@@ aling and screen@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; bigger values give a more precise wire model and thus a better sewing for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball you can adjust the detail@@ ing stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you have a high level of detail@@ ing for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model is used further when the camera is an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the sen@@ k@@ rights proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the wall , a wall is framed behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess boards of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the floor , a bottom is cut down below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess boards from two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you activate cant@@ on satur@@ ation , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for the ren@@ dering of the scenes can be set . exact details of the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can modify existing shut@@ ters or create new window options . in the window , you can create window options , as you can create window options . &quot;
the Com@@ bin@@ ational Field Window System : shows all existing windows of windows . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the window frames when starting the program .
the list of existing shut@@ ters displays all existing shut@@ ters . a new arrangement can be used with the button adding and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
any window of window will be identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window assignment . new views can be used with the button adding and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Bel@@ ow you get the window under the existing window , with card card you get a cart@@ on display together with the previous view and p@@ ending the view not in the main window , but also generates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just got &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ post v@@ model@@ er : installed and now you would like to follow with more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene below : a sphere on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before they complain that you can use as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to Ren@@ ders as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
if you do not insert light sources lies your whole scene in the dark and you get just a black picture .
&quot; if you have anything less installed , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window order : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . read the documentation , so that you can expect a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their use . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide first you need to remove all objects from the object of the object . select the scene and then choose the menu entry . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you create . especially note that in the fourth wire model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object @-@ tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view properties which can be found in the different parameters of the camera . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; find more details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later subject to instructions , but pay attention to the camera in view control points . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button @-@ button or the entry paste , the wire model @-@ views and the object @-@ tree immediately change these settings . as a result they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could make for example a Qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a compreh@@ en@@ sible method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides an easier option . you can use an infinite level as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object @-@ tree , change the name and then press the button . in the object @-@ tree , the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view is also shown at the level , although at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the level extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object @-@ tree , you will find that you click the entry for the bottom . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you &apos;ll see one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the properties tab . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the horizon @-@ line , so that you can get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first , select the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but select a moment of time . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog box where you can choose how the object is inserted . please select the name in the object @-@ tree ( name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a m@@ att@@ ain@@ ly black material because you have to check the configuration of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , please enter the colors for the pigment . also for this there are many possibilities , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est . &quot;
&quot; if you do not preview the color on qu@@ ader and ball , just click on the button below and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is now properly adjusted . if you ren@@ dering your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . what you expect . here are still further settings necessary . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called the entry color list . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board colour list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
select in the object or change the colors in the view of the properties tab :
&quot; this step you should already run easily , since you have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er . the ball is just as easy as the floor create : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the properties tab , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( you do not forget the entry button or the button . otherwise , the ball above the ground , since you have shif@@ ted the ground around a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering now results a strange result : as before you see , the ball @-@ surface looks like a m@@ att@@ it black material . put in the following step an suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to you now . as already on the floor , give the ball a pig@@ ment as colour : &quot;
&quot; select the same subject and change the name for example in ball pigment . click ball pigment , select then plain , and set the values as below : &quot;
&quot; however , you can reach more interesting effects if you take time to set some finish properties : &quot;
&quot; then change the values as in the following screenshot , click on An@@ gle or press Enter . &quot;
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed finishes , even if Met@@ allic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what ways offer you &amp; k@@ post v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned so much , you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional image or a model .
&quot; if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , sho@@ ots the ren@@ derer from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( d. h. from the camera , which is reflected by the objects in the scene and like atmosph@@ eric effects such as fo@@ g . so the scene is adjustable for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you can also see any scene that is to be rendered to , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in standard file dialog you can select a file that you previously worked with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; created
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and re@@ places the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you already stored the model , it is stored under the same name , it is a new file , you must enter a name and storage space . &quot;
rest@@ ores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
this menu entry can only select if you have not stored any changes in the scene .
&quot; repeated the most recently made command . this menu entry , you can only select if you have the Edit returns . &quot;
saves the current window of window and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behaviour . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ post code ; commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove with this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ post v@@ model@@ er ; commands to remove and remove .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to smoke surfaces without any bending on the surface individually model@@ ed and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is usual to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a text map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ rical shapes , which you can use as components : very complex 3D models are made from do@@ z@@ ens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then advanced to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color based on Pixel basis , using an image file as colour card . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image @-@ looking and navig@@ ator . the application has a file browser where you can choose pictures to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can see with Click &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return Return .
&quot; you can adjust whether any picture should be displayed in a separate window , or if all pictures are to use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field in the right corner . if a pass@@ en@@ ame file was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five boxes . in three of them , general and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short command for the display and short command for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut for the respective window can be defined . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected then the pictures in full screen mode will be opened . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface filled with the background color that you can continue on . pres@@ et@@ ting is not a full screen mode . &quot;
this point is enabled to load &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already view the next picture in the folder while you still see the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when sending the name of the recently opened folder . next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click the colored bars to select a background color in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode , the window is bigger than the image is also filled here with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can establish &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; to set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can be the program also . &quot;
with this option is enlarged for large images of the ad ster on the full screen . this option is switched as default .
determine whether the slideshow with the first image in the folder or with the selected image should begin .
&quot; the time span between the image change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can insert a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . is this value added to 0 , the slideshow is repeated as long as it is cancelled due to the user , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the pres@@ et@@ ting is 1 . &quot;
change here the short@@ cut for the different modes of the &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the map @-@ cards short command for the display and short rest warran@@ t for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ es@@ ystem ( a window for the sub @-@ folder and a window for the sub@@ folders and one window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;

&quot; in the fields of surfaces , you can choose the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indic@@ ator should be displayed in contrast . submission should display a bright color and over@@ tones a dark colour . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ f@@ oto , has a side bar on the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to selected pictures . the same page bar can also be found in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders . &quot;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to sc@@ ans pictures that no longer makes images to sc@@ ans and desc@@ end .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; a simple application to sc@@ ans the pictures that no longer makes images to be sc@@ ans and altern@@ ate . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store for each image to save a dialogue with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the storage box .
you can check the status of support of your scanner at SAN@@ E proj@@ ections by sending the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; by command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , then a dialog is opened to the selection of scanner . &quot;
the user can select the sc@@ ams scanner and press the OK button to open the scanner . breaking &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .
the further settings contain more detailed options of the drivers . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not treated particularly .
&quot; to view a picture , the user can start only a preview can start and then try scan@@ dal for the final scan . the pre@@ sch@@ can will be started by the preview @-@ button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can enter into the image and out of the current selection of zo@@ oming . it can also adjust the zoom in so that the complete preview of the window fits . &quot;
if the picture was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if before stor@@ ing a preview image displayed in the settings , then the image is shown in a fore@@ front as shown below is displayed , then the image will be saved and flo@@ foil ? s leads to a break@@ age and you will go back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before stor@@ ing . in this case the option should be displayed before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option should be chosen . &quot;
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures can be saved . dialog to save each image will open the dialog in front of each folder image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; then you will need to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to be asked without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the option to save for a fil@@ en@@ ames , then this folder is used as default for dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically re@@ viewing images and is moreover the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image is stored by numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix the jed@@ n@@ ay # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # . &quot;
&quot; the user can adapt the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the compression value in saving . if choose the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts KDE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ Manual . the button above starts the KDE About @-@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings will show the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of this p@@ ups and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts you set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Properties button by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select short command ... select .
you may set up your existing multimedia keys so that they are as &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; -@@ short rest function . this makes your keyboard to &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; -@@ Control Center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of AMAR@@ OK has many general functions to be found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the D@@ CO@@ P feature of collection , text browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . an example to give a call for the D@@ CO@@ P function , &amp; eg ; so look : &quot;
AMAR@@ OK supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . additionally , AMAR@@ OK still has some own command line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback when the script can not be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , whether all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog so that the user notes , why a script does not run . &quot;
BE@@ G@@ IN require &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum ( KDE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is Workshop for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit &apos;
in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as basis for your own scripts or simply to extend the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange with AMAR@@ OK and controlling it . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which each KDE installation should be included . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands . this is usually used the function Ex@@ ec . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be accessed relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; send noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts are continuously monitored and react accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
configure the script to display the furniture dialog . to save the stor@@ ing data . when a script is started to display the Work@@ place on the folder where all data should be stored .
&quot; tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played , the script could now ask for example : with D@@ CO@@ P features further information on the new piece ( for example the metad@@ ata or the st@@ oves ) . &quot;
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alized a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ ers@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le , In@@ cludes the path to select the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry can also use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ Shi@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; AMAR@@ OK , either , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed to do such as au@@ fr@@ y . for example , e.g. the saving of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok@@ s script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded for user &amp; eg ; such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ t@@ ar ) , which can optionally be extrac@@ ted with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can optionally be extrac@@ ted with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an arch@@ iv@@ .@@ amar@@ ok@@ scri@@ pt@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so the user can clearly see the archive as a AMAR@@ OK script package . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the advanced amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages alike .
the main cri@@ pts must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) to be the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters to get the file rights :
if your script is ready you can upload it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the W@@ iki script page from &amp; AMAR@@ OK . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category AMAR@@ OK ; script .
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; has many useful and powerful functions and still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; AMAR@@ OK , you can easily go to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you can also find a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; &apos;s collection @-@ browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
perhaps you have already some play@@ lists but can never decide which you want ? then the play@@ lists is exactly the right for you . and if you choose the decision to select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
&quot; AMAR@@ OK has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gener@@ ic USB devices . additionally , many other useful functions make AMAR@@ OK to the most advanced audio player . AMAR@@ OK is smart , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , you need to enter the basic folder of the AMAR@@ OK sources to compile the following , to compile and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should compile no difficulties . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK . has like most applications to activate some options that can enable the comp@@ iling @-@ time with the configure @-@ script or disable it . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options must be able to comply with certain dependen@@ cies so that they can be used in the section of system requirements .
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; can be set up without effort about the furniture dialog . the furniture dialog has several maps to set up the various functions of &amp; AMAR@@ OK .
&quot; player window display the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists will be sh@@ own@@ Ju@@ K . &quot;
&quot; tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; AMAR@@ OK , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option brings the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; atmosph@@ eric design : this function is only available if &amp; AMAR@@ OK , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this used the color scheme for tuning bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; voting files in the music files place : this feature is only available if &amp; AMAR@@ OK , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files in the Settings folder of the respective music files will be loaded ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; AMAR@@ OK will be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to a different browser which is not found in the list .
&quot; playlist when saving , the current playlist automatically saves the loading of &amp; AMAR@@ OK . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist if you don &apos;t want to lose . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; relative paths to the music files , depending on the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date piece with the piece of change is visible , that the play@@ lists can hold windows - / ab@@ rol@@ ed to keep the constant play always in the visible window area . &quot;
in the piece change to the context @-@ browser change automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the section appearance you can customize &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; s appearance adjust . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fonts section you can use the use of different fonts in &amp; AMAR@@ OK . you can choose text for the following section : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . press to select ... , so you can select a desired font from the dialog dialog . &quot;
&quot; with a selection of custom colour scheme , you have the Qu@@ al of choice and can set a private color scheme . use the included color selection for the foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;
&quot; playing at the start , means that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; after the program start playing automatically with the piece on the spot , with which she was stopped at the end of it . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display enables you to set up the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click on the font ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the starter box means that the text in the O@@ SD will be represented .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . one click on the color surfaces opens the dialog to color choices . when peculi@@ arities are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ ies are used ; colors are used . &quot;
the input field display shows the text shown in the O@@ SD . by adding plac@@ ements the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available space @-@ card and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen will appear a multiple @-@ monitor environment .
the map @-@ card audio @-@ output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down menu . some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this map .
the map collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . that includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folders , browse the files . to search for a folder into the collection , select the cross @-@ box next to his name . this section also contains An@@ kreu@@ z@@ felder to introduce how to proceed with selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folders search browse : this causes &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; both the crossed and their sub @-@ folder to music is determined .
changes : allows &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . besides , an incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists import : causes that &amp; AMAR@@ OK , all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection include added play@@ lists then later in the play@@ lists browser . &quot;
&quot; the part of the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ational field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another set up in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql setup is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql set @-@ up section is used to set the database for &amp; AMAR@@ OK . under machine : will the host enter , on which the My@@ S@@ ql database is inserted under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is produced . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data you need for connection to the database .
the card @-@ card loads .@@ f@@ m depends the support for duty .@@ f@@ m . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; can transmit the names of don@@ ors to a duty .@@ f@@ m server and need to create music recommendations on the current piece .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your duty .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the duty .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; split pieces send and thus update the profile : this setting enables it &amp; AMAR@@ OK , to transmit the name of the split pieces to your duty .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters to call : after activation of this setting , &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each piece . note : you may need not load the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need duty .@@ f@@ m @-@ profile to use this feature . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshot .
&quot; AMAR@@ OK only needs the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs contained therein , because &amp; AMAR@@ OK , some of them to find such as modules or scripts ) . we have a little guide written , how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD add that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will thus work , but flu@@ x@@ box is used for example , we try K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these are prepared an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ b library . you can check the file by clicking on ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . please report this bug where you delete the crash . then you can delete the file and let the collection again create .
mostly it is that T@@ agli@@ b cr@@ ashes when reading the Met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ us @-@ developer using bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is somewhat mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version have been compiled . if e.g. &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this leads to dis@@ closing the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re using KDE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate automatic . switch , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ ups by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens to a crash ) . if it is a common crash , and you will send us a good che@@ at , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the Met@@ a @-@ Info , but this is not considered Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / perl the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot;
this script requires Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 always active . this is a known error in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you have the status De@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases up to three times a symbol must click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ anim@@ ate symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then please check if it &apos;s OK the correct Q@@ t library . this enables you to see the correct Q@@ t library &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ ing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust that AMAR@@ OK the right version first finds . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify the light@@ est by the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # AMAR@@ OK .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter only one error if something is located at the fe@@ eder of a bug in the AMAR@@ OK itself .
after the start of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; appears only a blank playlist . how to get there now music pieces ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start -@@ sub@@ window will be transformed into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with AMAR@@ OK 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are automatically calculated by the user while the points will be automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces of pieces , the playlist of the playlist must be displayed in the playlist , to select the rating for one piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when it looks OK in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and select the playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let them drop there exactly as you would like it with other files . so simple is that : - )
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add @-@ button , you can save the button . click on it . &quot;
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install it . again . look even after lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . also you will find it via the menu bar under extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question are supported G@@ asp@@ amer / X@@ ine / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support as pretty much every concei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and PN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be delivered in the pres@@ et@@ ting no MP3 @-@ decoder ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , GG : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , n@@ ab@@ et@@ aste &quot;
run the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . at least ... &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; plays MP3 &apos;s starting : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ ear @-@ S@@ ink with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device has to provide a mix@@ er . a mix@@ er enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix -@@ Module for Al@@ sa ( software mix@@ er ) . &quot;
&quot; the issue of this command should help you find out for the problem of problems and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide a different set ( e.g. os@@ sal ) . &quot;
&quot; this is doing &amp; AMAR@@ OK . already , you don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice when you &apos;re looking for a decade or a little over@@ head . G@@ ear reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly on AL@@ SA , just like X@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable sound server with maximum possible priority ( real @-@ time list ) and increase the size of sound buff@@ ers ( warning ! see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set :
&quot; with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DEM@@ O Code@@ cs , which can indu@@ ce playback . read this error report . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA @-@ furniture file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or X@@ ine , or install KDE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the X@@ ine driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control center and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less slow acting the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; AMAR@@ OK . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ ear @-@ components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask at IR@@ C -@@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
try this ( exit &apos; OK before ! ) : - Upload you down , compile and install it . then run the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . start now &amp; AMAR@@ OK . &quot;
please tell us about bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes please send them the best to our mailing list : AMAR@@ OK @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net .
&amp; AMAR@@ OK . is an album of the British Mike &apos;s field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . also includes the name of the magical K ... : )
thanks D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program an alarm and let you execute using the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK player play
&quot; this command leaves &amp; AMAR@@ OK . make sure that &amp; AMAR@@ OK , run before you go to bed , then you will have arous@@ ed off the soft tones of the music you stopped in front of bed . &quot;
how can we find the current situation in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; ongoing titles can be found on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is available you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ t and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name AMAR@@ OK player now@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa is available .
visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; AMAR@@ OK . click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changeable window . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button presents a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ hen@@ sion to a search in the playlist after a search in the playlist , the first search results will be played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the Control bar ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS @-@ drive . after starting from AMAR@@ OK the collection database can not be created and on the console appear many messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK to a local drive or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click in the menu on audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading change in the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code you take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String , &quot; SELE@@ CT play@@ counter , creat@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &quot; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( &quot; e@@ String &quot; ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this is the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played , the less influence has each individual rating on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the evaluation for a piece of yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a sp@@ readsheet in the playlist , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and edit Edit : review , you can also edit the rating also in the dialog &apos;s metad@@ ata . &quot;

&quot; all opened projects and ended &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each of the stored project will be wonder@@ ed what to happen , so as if you had called a file . &quot;
&quot; when you access this entry , you can choose from the apparent dialogue files for adding to the project . this has the same effect as if you &apos;re entering the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data @-@ CD , the new files will appear in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialogue &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button of burning . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project has already been data . &quot;
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings that most of them are described via the What is that ? ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful when you are using files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful for you to use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is for you rather than help you can already see existing files and folders .
&quot; this entry appears only in an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video project . this feature set up &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project to remove . all other files are removed in the project . this feature is no files from the medium , they bl@@ ends just the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this also allows you to create a CD into another medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a CD instead of normal copying . in addition , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should also prefer entr@@ ances if you want CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD Copy dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image of DVD with the help of copying . in addition , there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of copying . furthermore , the target medium will be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W CD .
opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can form@@ atting a DVD ± R ( W ) form@@ atting that the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the sp@@ elling and incre@@ mentally .
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously er@@ stell@@ ated CD picture . the dialog are asked for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c files are currently not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , for this you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
bur@@ ns a previously er@@ stell@@ ated DVD picture . the dialog is asking for a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button .
&quot; a previously worked DVD @-@ video can be converted . this dialog will usually appear after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used all @-@ standing video , code settings and even opportunities for change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the occa@@ sional medium . this information is displayed in the table view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and tracks length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of the toolbar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is crossed , the toolbar is visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small bar on the bottom of the window appears . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; switch the folder view , or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , the content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media information , locking and un@@ locking the running or throw of the medium . &quot;
&quot; off the content view , or off . the content view enables the selection and drag@@ ging files into the repository . the content view is also the interface to reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the Kop@@ fl@@ ei@@ ste in the project view is a narrow area that contains only visible when the project view open projects . the cou@@ pl@@ est has no real function , it looks just pretty and separates the project view clear from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialogue window to change key@@ boards for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one has chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the key@@ boards for it below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; combination assistant . with this , the correct enti@@ tl@@ ements to Burn CDs and DVDs are required . therefore , system managers are required , so you have to enter the password for system manager ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can apply general programs . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is to person@@ alize and intended for fine tuning of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , using a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , interface . with the help of this interface can be controlled parts of the functionality for example via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions to use , you can either use the command line utility d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programmes are identical in functionality , so that is more your taste and the type of your tasks is crucial to which the con@@ den@@ ial programs you give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we will use that you use the command line application d@@ co@@ p . to utilize the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then you will have something like the following at console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program ma@@ stered , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts are described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface between &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format @-@ DVD and more functions to create new projects . &quot;

K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reading for &amp; k@@ ; . with it , you can easily be saved audio CD ; s have been read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder which is installed on the machine . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files ( compres@@ sing ) . currently , l@@ ame supports MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FL@@ AC ( compres@@ sed compres@@ sing ) can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and compres@@ sed in WAV files on the computer ( encrypted and compres@@ sed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step this WAV files ( usually one per title ) compres@@ sed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats , such as the V@@ lu@@ st@@ free FL@@ AC . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step you have to be installed ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers already exist , so it is most likely not necessary to compile something yourself . but only the codi@@ le packages are not used . if for example FL@@ AC is not used , its installation is not required . &quot;
which body @-@ file should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to en@@ coder , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ int ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to avoid any protected audio CD ; even if not the mechanisms of copying them . avoid using the purchase of copying audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the set @-@ up is to be done only once ( the interior dialog can be found so often until one suitable configuration has been found ) , following the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads to the understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , which you can often stum@@ ble on the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on what Ko@@ di@@ ers programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
can get &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can be completely working without network where everything is manually recorded .
&quot; this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , more information on how this program is used as well as screenshot with descriptions of regi@@ sters for configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of inquiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection must first be made to the internet . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if an en@@ coder has been configured in the code of the code and en@@ coding settings - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the choice of another En@@ coder can be read as the default . it is to be noted that previously the en@@ coder has been configured in the code of code settings in the dialog dialog . &quot;
opens the file manager so that an already logged file will be chosen instead of a complete &amp; CD ; ex@@ changing and en@@ coding .
opens the dialog dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programs ( like reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main dialogue dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various maps ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the en@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes audio quality , en@@ co@@ aster and compression rates and helps you to choose the right body . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a hot @-@ free audio format is required . besides FL@@ AC , there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce those files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , lose information through data compres@@ sing according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , are MP3 and O@@ GG , the most common ones . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both Ko@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos;@@ free , l@@ ame is still free with most distribu@@ tions free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high degree of sound ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG system is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car audio systems . today - initially 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters to the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the tun@@ es acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 kb@@ ps up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ oster@@ e@@ o@@ ists . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ agger@@ ated for most people and most of the environments but if you necessarily have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that are manually entered or retri@@ eved by the program from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be handed over , and en@@ code program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ di@@ er@@ programmes , there is often a combination of programs for the en@@ coder and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the key@@ word ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switch must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like : &quot; ... &quot; tt { title } ... &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters , which can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in assist@@ ants ) : &quot;
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database where people can read the audio CD , so that all others can download this information instead of entering into the calcul@@ ators : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m. des U@@ eber@@ ger &#93; . however , no one may refuse to be added by the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither can neither the artist nor the music do damage . all information can be added anyway at a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively sharing a cross @-@ cross field ( sending a address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as being used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address in the retri@@ ev@@ ing of the server is not used ( This may only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for using free@@ DB is set up , the geographical on the next underlying mirror server should be needed . this saves band@@ width in the network and resem@@ bles the load between hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of Mir@@ ror Servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively you can download the complete database or ( usually issued monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which exhaust program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there is ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to know , looking at source code .... This is always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the output WAV files , the en@@ coder and therefore the desired file format may be chosen . at first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for audio data ) on the regi@@ stering of the code . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab itself . &quot;
the codi@@ le package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined code . additional information about en@@ coder are in chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a code you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ en@@ window ( eg ; console ) .
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the device recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio @-@ en@@ erer of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programmes with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , these tips can give you how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step by step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will set up the program for the first time to read everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found as not completely free software . at any rate , it is not necessary to compile the source files , whatever you can do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists of you own ( eg ; by trying to copy with the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic income of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that probably will be done once again and &quot;
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; to be repeated for each input &amp; CD ;
here we determine the en@@ coding Ko@@ di@@ ver to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . because we are la@@ zy to use the program to download the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
&quot; although we can change this settings at any time , we will most likely be able to read it on every detail of a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device recording is handed over to the reading program that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can read .
&quot; frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device recording of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , so a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries available for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the map of general settings . here you do not find much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be shown as shown / included as shown in the screenshot .
only in case of complete information please inqu@@ ire so you will be informed when information about the testi@@ cles of keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD . data automatically downloaded from the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the reading of the &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the internet so that he can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; this is associated with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can easily be changed using the database entry and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example is further to note : if you want to manually enter the selection of free@@ DB locally in offline mode , if you want to download the database before . however , it is twice worthwhile . in order to use free@@ DB at the Off@@ lin@@ em@@ o@@ dus , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode will be furnished on the following map . &quot;
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data inquiry for the retri@@ ev@@ ing of the free@@ DB server over the Internet . how does the system you get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything as shown in the screenshot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database and we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server nearby . on this way the burden will be distributed between hosts . this setting will be the first try to work .
&quot; both are both equi@@ val@@ ed what the server concerns , since but many fire@@ walls record 88@@ 80 by default , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transfer any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first approach will be de@@ generated .
just take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; quantity at the same time : exc@@ use , there is one reason why more than one at the same time when using only an existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es read and co@@ operating ? the author does not know it , therefore easy to try . &quot;
&quot; CD : after reading the last piece , follow this to throw the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you pass this an@@ kreu@@ z , then the box may be stored , if only space on another drive is stored . if the box does not be cli@@ pped if you don &apos;t want to make this folder if you want to make yourself something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; all , enter as it is shown on the screenshot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances the command must be left to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . that reached compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage power . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of generating tags on Version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted as needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Day &amp; % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
Set the rest as in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of WAV files at the same time , with dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to make more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we have just finished the basic establishment of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; termin@@ ated . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; in this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , which is arranged in the previous section , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB is described , the process of which is described in this section needs to be repeated for each input &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD ; use , the screenshot is not yet contained in free@@ DB , see the screenshot of the screenshot now . therefore , you will learn to manually enter the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , instead of collecting them from the internet . comments will refer to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this Hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet done , so now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screenshot . this only when the &amp; CD ; can be identified as audio CD ; could be identified and be read from c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this is not happening then you are looking for questions and answers to the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the free@@ DB could be retri@@ eved , all titles of the pieces are already filled and also the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ keys for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best for your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you do not choose the cross @-@ box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually choose the data from the Internet , but need the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - input of CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screenshot , the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; The title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
the artist does not need to be given more in the input field &apos; The &apos; The title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ ph@@ ell per unit , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful call of data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editors ( such as all words with big letters , or not ... ) but also to prove whether there is any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary area . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 @-@ tags ; you have an unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; they have a look at the tab of code settings ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime using the tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags will not be supported by all co@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the en@@ erer to find more information .
simply select an entry that obviously agre@@ es with the style of ex@@ empl@@ ary CD ; this is not important as we do not submit . for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editors appears again and you see that the fields are filled for the album already with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the item . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way up to you all the titles from the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are shown on the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles are printed out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or if you choose the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection out of the reading process , this window appears to be confirmed . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab jobs to switch on the order window . it is in the upper left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently printed on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed on the lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message can see if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ ver you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target group are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you write writing to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and en@@ coding in parallel . note the status of the status in the bottom of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration settings to lower this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes is to read and en@@ coding . in high @-@ performance machines the result is un@@ clear . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem at the simultaneous reading and en@@ coding ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window appears . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; will now communicate with CV@@ S as part of the k@@ icks package . however , you can download an anonymous copy of it . most distribu@@ tions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ int ; some distribu@@ tions include an anonymous copy . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons , comp@@ iling from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program which calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows the screenshot of the various maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that may not be used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked , without any cl@@ ue as it is to go on this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program , no audio CD ; in drive ) , or by un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what about it ? who reads , probably already has the program started . it should look somehow this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not maintain this manual . it is as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; however , it may do something . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has taken this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange , if it succeeded in making the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need to get these Inform@@ ations but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ ace of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he did not have real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time surveys by texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX players . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS and k@@ de ; support function . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und project drivers , which is required for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequence . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphic representation of activity of any MIDI channel as by the boun@@ cing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop is that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid can be drag@@ ged .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( cou@@ plings or tex@@ tured directories ) . K@@ Mid can automatically determine the procedure used .
&quot; seating support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song end , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select opening ... from the menu file select . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window appears . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to add a piece of music , open it and bet@@ rot@@ ate the kno@@ b off in the toolbar , select the entry out of the menu or bet@@ rot@@ ate the paste . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts as soon as you pull it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will pull it to a collection and then played on one another . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece is playing , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ display and so change the playback speed . to get back the original pace , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the emp@@ tin@@ c@@ aste has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button as a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu , so breaks the playback . if you play the emp@@ t@@ ant during no piece , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the reproduction . &quot;
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event . some pieces use lyrics and again other both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event is automatically selected , so you don &apos;t have to manually configure the entry into an automatic text option . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other kind . &quot;
&quot; if you want to adjust an event type , select from the menu settings to read entries or songs . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that summar@@ ize . these are summar@@ ized in the line . in this section stands how you can use collections effectively .
&quot; to view a collection , first open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... click New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will include the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can tune in the collection manager at the time . &quot;
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not saved . concern that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , they must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button of adding a song . it appears in turn , the file dialog with which you can choose the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
if automatic adding to the collection is activated a piece in opening ( using file Open or drag &amp; Drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and pun@@ ished . this collection will then be added to the open pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection of collection , select the collection and the desired song and then click away . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the row after the sub @-@ menu order of menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or choose a random order in the menu , the order is set new . &quot;
&quot; to add a song to a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list over the Kara@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump in a song , select the button next song from the menu or press arrow arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump off , choose a song back , select the button of previous pieces , the entry pre@@ previous piece of the menu piece or push the button arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select there the delet@@ ing collection and click the button Clear . &quot;
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not play a role as it is not saved by the exp@@ ir@@ ation of &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events occur in events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map showing all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et , and therefore always be a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI Map , because all sound maps GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . you must edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all required conver@@ sions for the play of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP -@@ section , which may appear as often as desired . prerequisite for this is , however , that each occurrence is a different text@@ ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a paragraph is achieved . &quot;
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section the patches of general MIDI to your specific keyboard will be shown . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is believed that the GM -@@ Pat@@ ches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also do not leave a line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to place all sounds , which will need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which is similar to a thread . &quot;
&quot; now if a MIDI @-@ file is to play a note with patch 127 ( Win ) , it is Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI @-@ file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch is meant that each tone is a different per@@ ver@@ sion@@ instrument ( Drum , bas@@ ins , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone is always the same drum means ( like him possess some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to specify as notes on a specific channel or instrument .
&quot; as in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP -@@ section the order of lines is very important , as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define for each channel and each instrument for several key@@ boards . you only need to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are needed above all to make t@@ ints on the be@@ zel channel . check out as an example the included Key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to switch some channels to others . if you want to change the first and second channel , you can easily make it in the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered between 0 to 15 , constructed according to the following patterns : &quot;
&quot; N is the canal which is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be used further on this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events are ignored which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , then always patch will be used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k@@ ets patch on the pist@@ on @-@ channel channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Ratio will be revealed in which ratio Pit@@ ch bench@@ marking events will be multiplied . if a MIDI file is transm@@ uted with the value it is calculated with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to stand in the map file ( dec@@ imal number ) .
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives you that a keyboard , which is an Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der event will play with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , but try some key@@ boards up to a oc@@ tave higher . unfortunately , try to find the right value on your keyboard , you must test a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the canal view is a window with a whole series of pianos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pianos , which sounds are just played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the canal view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you can choose an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
the rab@@ al view has ( until now ) two different views to display the shown sounds . the view select in the menu Settings under the point Kan@@ al@@ ight : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed , with which a song will be played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you find e.g. a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , speed , etc . . thus , the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can force anyone to use , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI @-@ file needs a similar sound quality . with a MIDI @-@ file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this may happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; no A@@ we need to compile the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid . &apos; s homepage ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
activate previously definitely the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can taste the arrow key from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ work@@ space a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I need to play a MIDI file ( when I &apos;d like to play a MIDI file ) or play a file , only to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and select the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them equal to a collection , turn the setup automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will add to temporary collection . opening of files &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . only do you only want to play the first file . so make the setup automatic adding to the collection and opening A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file . &quot;
then join also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or postcard . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , animated me that , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the moment I wrote a lot of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I have to collect MIDI files , music do and prove them . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me simply happy to write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ es &quot;
&quot; they really make me a great pleasure , if you want to send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kara@@ oke file from a local group . all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but should you get in touch with me because I might have the file already . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; fully written in my spare time , and I don &apos;t want to say anyone so much for money , because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. B@@ üh@@ ler - Fix@@ ing the error that the Ton@@ ist at A@@ we @-@ Cards was too high .
&quot; my thanks also applies Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the testing of the CIS support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Hans @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ er , Ulrich Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , a fault error or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the web , which give us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid , also found on his homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ ter@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . on the homepage you can find the development , information search and pictures . you will also find links to sites with other Kara@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends considerably from your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use an FM radio or an A@@ we card . &quot;
&quot; if you have no sound@@ card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; start with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , except if you would like to hear a sound@@ card except you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed to play video files from M@@ Player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as playback of DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet termin@@ ated as &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer it was installed .
for additional help please check the page The KDE website on new versions or to send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mail@@ ing list .
&quot; the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ escent windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is a information window that can only be displayed when information can reproduce . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to select the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , so you should use the category lasting playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical archive . if you copied a entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups to the current category is copied and the reproduction begins with the added entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; Current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also change through direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it . however , the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / km@@ player , can select from the menu view and next editing mode . by pressing a sub@@ group is shown only the XML content of this part . &quot;
&quot; according to the change of XML files , the menu has to be selected from the menu with playlist and either chosen either the machining mode , or another category selected . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the machining mode will leave or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; Generator , some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation at start@@ up and end can be disabled by the Edit of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ ar@@ c and amendments from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can simply be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; Mon@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / km@@ player / ver@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during start@@ up needs not be short , it will automatically ends by opening a different source . this would however be distur@@ bing in the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application for a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite image : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ .@@ &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; / body@@ gt ; are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL that are supported by &amp; Generator .
&quot; there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in configuration dialog by &amp; Mon@@ player ; . here , the path runs from the M@@ Player and the clip@@ board size of the dat@@ stream from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for trou@@ bleshooting is the button console &apos; in the toolbar of km@@ player . here is the output of M@@ Player .
&quot; there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; Mon@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ master@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played : &quot;
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; Mon@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field of Em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to reproduce the &amp; Mon@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; Generator for the M@@ IME @-@ type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the interior dialog file assignment of KDE can be specified . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; Mon@@ player ; is a con@@ soles to start and search for error on the loading of the browser module library . the conc@@ e@@ art@@ ete process is rel@@ uc@@ t@@ player . if here does not occur here , the back@@ end issue within &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; with this always taken a pre @-@ made back@@ end for a certain M@@ IME type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ master@@ c . for example , PH@@ ON@@ ON all og@@ g files can be re@@ played : &quot;
&quot; and km@@ player ; can be worn by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner from the configuration dialog can be used or the configuration file may be manually operated . &quot;

since the V@@ DR support from km@@ player can also function X@@ Video ( pres@@ um@@ ably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )

are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive le@@ iser when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root after entering the device . it is absolutely sure to put that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive shows . &quot;
X@@ ine will only start slowly anyway where any time my CPU must be tested on its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ e. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically takes the last saved value only the first time will test the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; lat@@ ex ; : a professional cabinet application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be attributed to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or , tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) . &quot;
&quot; most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux , distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD can be used . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distribu@@ tions . these allow simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the k@@ ile .
&quot; this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users need to be hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions regarding the documentation must be taken into account . however , the support for this project or its documentation is required , the support should be made via the k@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or to comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile , or will add enh@@ ancements to this , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ work@@ space . furthermore , the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs in a graphic interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made tools for this . in conclusion , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his options should learn the manual of K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be started directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; C@@ ate .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right balance : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . take care of the ur@@ chin &amp; Tex ; difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros is also that it origin@@ ates from the sur@@ names of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; here is only a good perspective to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . about H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; just as other interpre@@ ting languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the most common properties like paper format , page num@@ is@@ per begins with the command \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { document } and must be closed again using the command \ \ &apos; { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ release assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a perfect function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; for the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document .
&quot; classes : this type of document is said : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , project ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , projection &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; , slides &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; coding : hereby the string coding is set . modern systems is used to use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 @-@ coding as standard . best , if U@@ TF @-@ 8x has to be used ( to correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list reveals the mostly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration of them , they can only be found in the cross @-@ box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Com@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German regulations ) . you should always be used in the creation of German texts . &quot;
new users are now not worried about this . it is only a brief description of the functions and additional information in this section are given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; k@@ ile , it is possible with great difficulty of a gr@@ acious text of output anyway . however , it is possible to save it by the hum@@ ble appearance of output file . however , it is estimated to save you through the high@@ lighting time and time . &quot;
&quot; with automatic verification of the environments , for input of a new command ( e.g. \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blank page ( for entry of the text ) and the associated line may be created ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in men@@ tioning settings ; set up ... La@@ TeX commands . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; return the classification of the document into the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ mis@@ leading element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by mouse click the respective system . &quot;
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; -@@ File &#91; smo@@ other file ) &#93; was created to jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the respective line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
&quot; a DVI ; -@@ file contained a description of the form@@ atted document , and also other information such as font and is adjacent to PDF the output type of &amp; Tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and straight@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; when using the data protection , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file has been cli@@ pped with the editor , the exact section is attached to the DVI ; -@@ source code is cli@@ cked on a section at &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text , becomes the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ viewers are inj@@ ected . &quot;
Master document : this function is simplified when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work is simplified with others .@@ tex files . when using a project a project can be adjusted to project project settings .
quick @-@ construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; Files : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file is used in the case of ob@@ serving , and there is no call to &amp; oc@@ ular ; after the fast construction . &quot;
&quot; for viewing the processing toolbar , the three large @-@ selection men@@ ue should be found for the quick entry of common elements into the document . the first selection of the document has been developed into parts , chapter , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the men@@ ue Additional is for the entry of items such as keywords , fu@@ cking notes or references . the options listed are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a description is created for a section , an image or other element . &quot;
cover : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection ) .
&quot; quoted from quote will be shown a selection list with liter@@ ary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; however , this only works when the file is necessary to a project . for the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; C@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; from hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection field with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ dd is used for determination of the secret@@ ary . it enables the secret@@ ary to be defined as the main text , the fu@@ cking notes etc . it is the following fonts : &quot;
&quot; in the call of &amp; k@@ ile , two choices for the creation of a new document by selecting the documents and as@@ certain@@ ties of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason to hand . &quot;
&quot; the br@@ aces after the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . will not be defined at the beginning , this may also occur in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex has to be compiled . the easiest way to this is to use the menu or the button @-@ set fast @-@ construction . &quot;
the source code must be saved in front of comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storage the storage is automatically taken out .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be sought after errors . if use of quick @-@ construction should be started &amp; oc@@ ular ; this is not the case , should also be noticed by logging . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English ) is a text that is treated differently from the remaining document . for example , a report with the fonts should have been created and only a few times . the command \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } . &quot;
&quot; the exemp@@ tions are only used within the environment ( of \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) , there is no circum@@ stance ( number ) for the variety within an environment . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities for the re@@ adability of re@@ adability and usability of the document . you can , for example , certain fonts , li@@ ant , inf@@ ant pressure , sub@@ stan@@ tive , etc . these commands may be added either using the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ ves and is long as long until it is closed by a \ \ end { emp@@ t } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be shown with \ \ emp@@ h { word } curve } .
\ \ Per@@ cent@@ age : creates a quote on the document . the quote starts with \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background was displayed for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mark@@ er language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; once in the wiz@@ ard a bit text was entered , a few adjustments for the better re@@ adability of the document should be accomplished . below are mind@@ ful quot@@ ation , a few places in the fat and cur@@ ves and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document was viewed , can be returned to the editor using the Editor View or Str@@ g E ( on the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; -@@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and sp@@ a@@ on . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is a wide file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; Tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the re@@ adability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer imaging . &quot;
&quot; for the print of a &amp; DVI ; file is the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking DVI , the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set properly ) . &quot;
the toolbar inst@@ alls the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code can begin the conversion into force @-@ down other formats using the button .
the prefer@@ ential search for the direct jump from the editor for the given position within the DVI ; -@@ File .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ z files . for this purpose , only Modern and settings must set up ... Tools construction . &quot;
&quot; to choose the pres@@ um@@ ance , the mouse @-@ cursor must be positioned in a row of the source code , and as@@ le@@ aded on pre @-@ search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewers will then take place . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; it must adhere to the corresponding line . this must be defined &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; used as text editor ( settings Ok@@ che@@ que ... editor )
&quot; if the exp@@ ul@@ ing of fast construction of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer should not appear , a mistake can be pre@@ viewed , this will appear in the log file or in the message window in summary . &quot;
&quot; the log file , the error source in the source code can be used in the editor . the logging file will always be used in which the error appears . in order to click the faul@@ ty line to be cli@@ cked on the error in the log file , and c@@ ile . jump to faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template for the document . the presented possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard for quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; right users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates enables you to be saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; Tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file p@@ us@@ ed or a new file will be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from the document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template , some string can be replaced with other data ( e.g. name or string coding ) . these variables enables you to set up settings in settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are to be replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ ENT@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering document class . typically , it will be used as a copy of documents : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ WS ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to creating a template is the use of assist@@ ants and that with it is provided by the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way the following steps has been completed :
&quot; when creating a new document , you can choose its own template instead of standard vehicles . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files created in a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one in the internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text@@ editor for programmers with the possibilities of reading and her@@ vor@@ ship of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many attitudes for &amp; K@@ ate ; they can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities should learn the manual of K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; they can be ordered there directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; C@@ ate .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , which can be accessed by La@@ TeX reference manual almost all commands , which can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; one double @-@ clicking with pressed beams , to choose the &amp; Tex ; -@@ words , that in this way you click \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . &quot;
&quot; when you run the text with the right mouse button , the text box will automatically be copied into the clip@@ board . &quot;
when using the arrow keys with ge@@ dr@@ af@@ ted envel@@ ope enables you to view parts of the source code in the editor window .
&quot; &amp; Gos@@ ile ; has the possibilities to browse the most varied types of source texts , and they emphas@@ ise it . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants may also be able to expand their own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu is highlighted in the jump to n@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ sten or last jumping mat , so that it is automatically highlighted in the first input of a string . &quot;
&quot; the Edit is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; K@@ ate ; already outstanding features were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under editing options are included in the following commands : &quot;
&quot; if a complete paragraph includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which meant on both sides a blank line ) . this extended significance conclude with it tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only bow thing in &amp; k@@ ile . is that the only bow thing is separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; selecting the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended significance , since this command also has also a lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with an area suspended ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for viewing a part of the document it may be removed completely , and by pressing the key . &amp; K@@ ate ; provides the keyboard short@@ listed below . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides the following commands to contain the following commands : &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of the Edit paragraph .
it has already been clear@@ ing that environments to play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for example also offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for additional work with &amp; lat@@ ex .
this command will be inj@@ ected to the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the command to reach the environment .
this command will be inj@@ ected to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the gravel .
&quot; if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { environment } , becomes the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a number of wast@@ ed Environ@@ ments , the command can quickly be lost . this command close the most recently en@@ acted environment so that the wast@@ ed environmental structure does not exist . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . under Edit@@ ing TeX Group are a few important commands , which correspond to the processing environment . &quot;
this command will be inj@@ ected to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp .
this command will be inj@@ ected to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded c@@ ammer .
if the cursor is before or behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp of a &amp; Tex ; -@@ Group # there will be inj@@ ected to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many wast@@ ed @-@ wel@@ ded groups cl@@ amps can quickly be lost . this command close the most recently used structure of the &amp; Tex ; -@@ groups cannot be atom@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple beginnings are used in &amp; k@@ ile . for the purpose of purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile , the sign is used for two easy beginnings of beginnings . &quot;
&quot; this automatic entry of the double beginnings can be set under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ TeX , and sign@@ posted . &quot;
you can also use your specific settings ( such as n@@ german or french ) and thus German or french beginnings . there are also many more languages available .
&quot; in the window of shift ; n@@ c@@ aste , a smart line @-@ quar@@ ry . if the current position inside a lists ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or item@@ ize ) is , for the current position in a lists ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
inside a tables -@@ environment slept with t &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to finish line .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to pres@@ et pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to the bu@@ ys . these can be added under Settings ; they set up ... La@@ TeX added .
&quot; some users complain the columns in tables -@@ environments , and all the E@@ t @-@ character ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; seeks to under@@ mine it . even though this tabby , is not enough for the columns , for the columns of the current table . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already has a good source text service , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still expanded . they are now working three according to your needs and the other two are for automatic default settings . all of these mo@@ di can be set up with settings K@@ ile ... &quot;
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { environment } turns &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when drag the back taste , the last letter of the entry is removed and unfortunately the complete list of data may be passed on . on the other hand , the list may be sent by input of a further letter also . &quot;
&quot; all orders are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , you can choose from &amp; k@@ ile ; alternatively , spr@@ ing@@ ed jumping mat , so that a simple leap into these positions can be found by means of the Edit spr@@ ing@@ ed jumping mat and the promised parameter then becomes apparent . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings to these lists can be made available to these lists ; -@@ and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as tan@@ gible of the general language used .
&quot; the command mode is available for full capacity of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN , and the call of the complete list may be used . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the integration of the environments . &quot;
&quot; in the call of the complete repository , the menu button or the short@@ cut of the environment is automatically captured and it will be \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN . after that , the environmental performance can be continued in the easiest way and by pressing the entry can be finished . &quot;
&quot; once this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognis@@ es that it is a lists environment , it is even a first \ \ item -@@ command . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; Set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings to these lists are used . this mode uses the desired list of the complete mode for &amp; Tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; the user &apos;s user @-@ defined lists of addi@@ tives , which can be set up immediately by gaps , the file exam@@ ple@@ .@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the Word has been en@@ forced to enter the menu , the letter b + Alt Le@@ g , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; gro@@ unded wi@@ gs are not helpful , however , that many guar@@ di@@ ers have been written in a document more than once . thus it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the disposal for all already written W@@ Ã ¶ ters . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in menu settings ... K@@ ile promises to be removed . here , the sw@@ elling value can be defined as well as the display of the procedure . &quot;

&quot; the dialogue graphics are designed by the design of graphics as simple as possible . to ob@@ serving the fundament@@ als to the graphics formats , the sections and notice should be observed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but also provide an excellent basis for viewing and re @-@ arrangements of pages . will the PDF file be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools re@@ arranged and then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to ensure the results of the work , you have to be compiled in the source tools . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menus creating comp@@ iling , creating change and create creation . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewers such as &amp; Oc@@ ular ; or the further transformation can be used by means of old ; 3 by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file is converted into a PS -@@ file , and by means of old ; 5 the PS @-@ file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the command quick @-@ building is normally called a viewer after the comp@@ iler . if no built @-@ in viewer should be used , every time will pop up a new window . &quot;
a new project will be introduced to the project new project .... here the following information for the project will be asked :

the script feature of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows to be managed by EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the sen@@ k@@ ly bar .
the API scripts have not yet been developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
first must be said that the exhaust environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods have :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly sophisticated system where the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ ex ; are delivered with many documents . they contain a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference reference .
&quot; this is not just a complete Re@@ ar Re@@ ar for &amp; Tex ; and it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather it is a fully equipped operating instructions for a specific form of form@@ atting , as it is a very gro@@ unded document , it is divided in &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , the finding of the right document does not always offer &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tured ; the small application of doc@@ tr@@ k , which includes a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and herein . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or stroke . from &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are shown .

&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation work , he knows , and how over@@ looks it . we lift it another piece , we give him a graphical user interface ! simply click on a terminal , simply cli@@ cked the symbol for the XML processor , and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application is expecting a index.@@ cf@@ book in the folder . if you find the current working director . if not , then remove the selection of current workers &quot; sor@@ ting , and enter them in the folder of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; -@@ files are deleted each time if supposed to be started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already been working , white , how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; there is now a great graphical surface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened file in the doc@@ book , then simply let them select the current working days . if not , then select the current working time and give them the folder to find where the doc@@ book can be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on screen , their file is faul@@ ted . please check the reported error and try again . &quot;
&quot; is the veri@@ fi@@ able file already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; then they let the current file simply hal@@ ted . if not , delete them at the current file the tick and select the file using another file - file sel@@ ections . &quot;

&quot; to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; that is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) , and enter the place of the D@@ TD ; ( External ) and enter the place of the Defin@@ itions , is the specification of the definition @-@ UR@@ I ; in the file sel@@ ector is required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; also has one &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tools ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; already , then they leave the current file simply chosen . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file select files . &quot;
enter the name of the file as the result is called to . the file is usually stored in their home folder .
&quot; the plugins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; themselves have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; even possibly little to do . therefore , the plug @-@ system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and need not wait until someone can use the ro@@ g@@ ased in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; they can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; these plugins can be used further below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start using the plug @-@ ins plugin . this is the following dialogue opened : &quot;
&quot; this dialog allows to manage all of the plugins and add new features . we will describe each &amp; GUI , element in it : &quot;
here you can enter the search pattern . when adding plugins without a storage place used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; this path to the Su@@ e of the plug @-@ in .
&quot; often , working on a project for several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; agon@@ ap@@ ing ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift , F@@ 7 Project Project properties tab . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explic@@ able . Nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project as well as sub@@ project leaders .
&quot; the user can look out from the list of team members , who he is . this happens by adop@@ ting the team member from the list , and the button are pressing as pressing . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears after you are : text . &quot;
&quot; the names and attitude of your identity are important to messages and remarks , see for further information . &quot;
&quot; beside the overview of her team , there is another benefit to capture the members of the team : it can be done an event for information on the team@@ leader when something happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that will run when something certain in the project happens . an example would be able to record the opening and end of a message when a file is secured , or a script that plays a file into the CV@@ S once it is added to the project &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; on the page Event Con@@ figuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project settings , it can be compiled and deleted events . &quot;
an e @-@ mail is sent to the recipient in the recipient list in the recipient list . the addres@@ sat may be a team or sub@@ project manager . see in that wo works can be set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
&quot; just enter comments is simple . it can be chosen either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ text menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in an commentary area followed by a comment text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax of team member states or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , taking part in the project from the following possibilities : teamwork Head of the team member states should be specified in the scope and sub @-@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; names and reels @-@ names are independent of large or small , but spaces around the br@@ aces and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting that D@@ TD edi@@ agnos@@ tic is and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta ... to be accessed via some pages that deals with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; agon@@ ists ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / low @-@ drop of tags : large / inf@@ ecting of automatically key@@ ed tags . normal wholes@@ ale , meaning , tags will be inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / low @-@ speed of attributes : large / inf@@ ecting of automatically key@@ ed attributes , the attributes are used to be inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if paid , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , immediately after the &amp; gt ; added . &quot;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
&quot; start and finish @-@ day automatically update : if switched off , the corresponding fee will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic yield of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic transformation of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the corresponding en@@ coding during entry .
M@@ IME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . by means of button the default features can be restored .
standard string coding : coding of newly created files or in other ways than with file Open files ( where the coding of the file can be transferred ) . this setting here is st@@ olen from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the chosen D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files , whose D@@ TD has not been recognized . this setting here is st@@ olen from the same in the proj@@ ections , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; creates regular backup copies , so that it can be restored by this backup or crash at the next start@@ up of the program . this is not the same as the saving of the file . also available for even stored documents is created regularly , according to the given time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editors or an own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ oons ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
&quot; ign@@ ite the window settings to the default back next start is useful when the user interface has come across to change the MDI @-@ Mo@@ des and An@@ do@@ cking / depend on views each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout Command parameters . &quot;
the warning range indicates the taxes of the possibility of switching the ad of war@@ nings by An@@ h@@ aken by Not more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ isation of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in shared mode . with regard to the various modes .
&quot; here the Par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse @-@ click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the structural structure with the mouse buttons , with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the field of struc@@ turing settings , the visibility of no@@ des can be opened automatically during the tree , the actu@@ alization of construction in the construction and how deep within a change of the structure tree is to be adjusted , while empty groups are such , in which the current document was not found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area for laying down the abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded in groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . this means , it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ an abbrevi@@ ation slightly different means than in a group is valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ Applications from the third page , which can be re @-@ used by every K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not at a stand@@ point like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be handed over to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in the &quot; &quot; Just @-@ L@@ esis &quot; &quot; mode : check whether the plugin refuse the store . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; tested the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; if the entered information is correct . however , the stor@@ ing of the entry is also available if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bleshooting was completely new developed . Die@@ ug@@ ger was set out completely new . instead of support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of this a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin concept was implemented , which allows different impl@@ ements about plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ w@@ ro@@ h ; inqu@@ ire . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugins in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in range can be changed the specific settings .
&quot; when for a project a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ point ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of excess variables is displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view , where all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually , in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is usually displayed in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger it is all or part of the following functionality available .
&quot; with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger is required , or they shares the plugin with , to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ y demands . this action is being opened by default , that a project is opened by default , so that there must not be respected in the normal case . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the foli@@ age to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to begin and press information on the excess variable , as well as the current introduced line regularly . when this happens when the script is finished , the script is started when a de@@ bit requirement was started , the script starts with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , to begin with the execution of the script , without inform@@ ing variables and the current pointer number . when this happens when a script is raised , the execution begins with a de@@ bit request , the execution begins as soon as a requirement is provided . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next instruction on the script without going to go into the functions or includes them .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes exten@@ dable . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bug@@ gers to go the instruction and go to the next one , as if there was the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , where a variable or an expression can be entered , the super@@ vised value will appear in the variation view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable . &quot;

&quot; this chapter describes how you can customize how to adapt to your needs , and how you can help your needs . &quot;
&quot; document type E@@ di@@ tier@@ pak@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; used to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages , as well as rec@@ tion@@ able ; their simplicity and flexibility makes a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web development , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script @-@ languages and family 2 , the script files and the toolbar . tag includes handmade , symbo@@ li@@ fied types of images ( above the E@@ di@@ tier window ) , the text and instructions faster into a document than one user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing D@@ TD . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; Agen@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ day ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the peculi@@ arities ; the file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool displays a quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without a risk of writing . &quot;
&quot; tag folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; to tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ cell ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the conference XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is described in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a conference document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain definition of many tags , but it can contain only one item type over itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the conference type class valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type of Meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; yes , the day has a clear attri@@ bute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is a just element type element .
&quot; describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this item can only exist once for each attri@@ bute . in addition , there are other tags to describe how this attri@@ bute is to be shown &amp; etc . this is a only one element . &quot;
returns the source code used for the attributes in the tag editor and in the attri@@ bute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; will be used for reaching source data .

&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a method name . the arguments that are handed over to the method . can be empty or % valid % , this means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attri@@ bute text only once . it is a only @-@ element type element .

to review the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog in the above &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; window to start and over@@ test Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions .
&quot; this function is currently not available yet . currently , the review only takes place when charging the conference files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ment ; &quot;
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; diagram &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this conference file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .

&quot; the &amp; Co tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is just as simple and there is an editor for this , accessible via D@@ TD Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ TD Settings . with it , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be compiled with the following entries : &quot;

an action can set up actions with settings ... click on New action leads to the same dialogue :
this promotion is defined by pressing the button . by clicking the button user can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer is the latest short@@ cut removable .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and when carrying out the action this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the powerful stock@@ ing@@ type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts ) , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use the document ( or parts of the document ) . even if the quick start @-@ start dialog or the various players in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EPs . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ cy Vari@@ able in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta /
&quot; % f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file , file : / from the document name . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; -@@ process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; from external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above @-@ stor@@ ed methods , a script can accept a script of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; in the default field entry can be determined to send what to default . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variation is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the entry can also be directed to the output of the installed application . there are two types of output : normal issue , which can be specified on the default version ; it can be specified when the default version has to be done by the default output issue is set by : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar can be added , you have to add and configure actions . select settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window will start the Edit mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the day to the appropriate tool .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag attributes , and you plan their use , activate dialog &apos; day edit &quot; &quot; if available , so that an entry when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; for creating a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit . select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics further programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses default 32@@ x@@ 32 Pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol is not only helping you to remember what the action is doing , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start@@ up as a symbol . due to the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as less , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user sign@@ aled , that clicking on this symbol is an &amp; lt ; Start in the current document . &quot;
after the creation of the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field there is a button .
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the contact button and continue with other tags , so there are yet which indicates , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to complement a number of usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; -@@ functions for the toolbar , or it should be used to adjust for a better overview of some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . open the toolbar dialog by setting the toolbar . make sure that the toolbar selected is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( very left above ) for my toolbar , which should be added to the toolbar , push the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to preview a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the separ@@ ator support group@@ ing . anyone who do not know my toolbar , could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
&quot; the new toolbar must be tested by sample all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; after real@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it is not included in the right folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder ( s ) so that their toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the worth men@@ tioning enlargement of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language , which you like most of it . therefore describes this chapter as I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , if any one has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc . language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second we treat here . &quot;
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = period , relative to this file , for example , 3@@ Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ tion@@ 2@@ .html ? &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text@@ List = &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text@@ List = 3@@ 2.@@ 3@@ .html . &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text@@ List = 3@@ 2.@@ 3@@ .html . &#91; Con@@ text &#93; context @-@ 2 , tag@@ 2@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; the section tree defines the visible portion of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you see it in PHP &amp; PHP ; documentation is something : &quot;
&quot; # KDE config File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements Top Element = Table of Cont@@ ents , # getting started , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index.html &#91; Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .html &quot;
refer to the # prior to getting started and Language Reference . this shows that there is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there are no known border for chess mode ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try yourself out .
you remember that the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent with the top end of the belly &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder is displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but watch out &amp; and lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; resources . &quot;
&quot; the index section is the area of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended to display the context of context @-@ text help . for example , if when writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context @-@ help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file @-@ binding list . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of by stain@@ ed context @-@ elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( so , as you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that this good and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; -@@ repository . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best Web@@ development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide the separ@@ ators resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can send by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email @-@ mail menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; users can be checked and only made available when our team need them as correct and us@@ eless for publication . to make an easy contribution to signing up to a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources are guaranteed , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading you will be asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys you may have to look out . in the dialogue of New resource , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading can be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload by the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , toolbar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installing , exam@@ ining &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; the in@@ vers@@ ality of the resource by exam@@ ining the integrity and the Sig@@ nific@@ ation . in case of problems war@@ ned it and it can then be cancelled . please note the warning . please note the warning and the resource is correct , a message appears with the specification of the Creator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; it is necessary to work by adding a D@@ TE@@ P package . it can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files in the tag@@ XML format may be necessary . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into an D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD Download and Convert a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which shall be used . afterwards , the following dialogue will be : &quot;
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ i@@ ding bar : the string that is in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Tag , like HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d release
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; after conversion the &amp; to tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; there are some key concepts . to understand and make full benefit from &amp; agon@@ ism , so you have to realize these concepts exactly with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; agon@@ ap@@ ing ; little benefit . &quot;
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; the workplace is divided into three areas : global , locally and project related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; uses , available . by tool systems that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; saved . this enables the group of administ@@ rators different toolbar , actions and patterns in the global tree which can then be available in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements constitute a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and toolbar . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related items are available only within a specific project . this can be done with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said that this is the most limited size . all elements are placed in the folder tree of the project as well as the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editors , the building views with info and the toolbar . please hit and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cart@@ ons with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the latest document entries , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the Edit@@ ors section lead to a further context menu in terms of the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste ) , editing of the mouse below the cursor or opening the file , when the string can be called under the mouse pointer to a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editors . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.01 tran@@ si@@ tional as a standard , for which a set of tool systems are shown . in the course of the further expansion of work , the toolbar can be adapted to the new functions and related users needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool systems is really light . if they want to insert a single day , for example &amp; lt ; then click the symbol which represents the day , then click a day that has several attributes ( like An@@ ker ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to be able to open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with boxes are available for files , project , model , script , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; this view shows all files in the project and allows the administration of files in the project by using right mouse click . actions such as adding , dischar@@ ging , up@@ loading , or delet@@ ing the files from the storage media can be performed with the shown menu menu . &quot;
&quot; the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . it provides all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; -@@ working area . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more on templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Local and project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can check the available information on a script , such as the script to boot , edit or send by e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on the item of the item , the cursor is set in the document on the item of the element . by right @-@ clicking element opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree will appear under the other construction views . with it , man@@ ly attributes change and attri@@ bution . this enables to change all available attributes , with few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can create pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; you can create own documentation , and by adding a folder to a project , you can add @-@ specific documentation to be edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ults ; two cart@@ els at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the user @-@ related information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this map shows information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . so , e.g. the D@@ TD of the current document are displayed and all changes to D@@ TD . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ on shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; agon@@ ite , which are executed , all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; tool systems are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the Chocol@@ ates of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; agon@@ ap@@ ment ; &quot;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ mail ; send the toolbar as a compres@@ sed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; and if they receive a toolbar in an E@@ mail ; they can save them into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; like any others secure and load !
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; -@@ files on your system , auto@@ conf can get a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to give a complete list of all options , give . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and here is not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with Star@@ ts of &amp; agon@@ ism , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder is . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; is a web development tool for KDE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a well @-@ engine@@ ered development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML , editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing began to deal with a nearby idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; a stand@@ alone , expan@@ dable Mark@@ up languages ? well , this would make him absolutely great Web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to re@@ ines &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; now , is already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; be the appropriate &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above demand must be determined that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; as a product based on outstanding efforts by free software , the idea of why developers , what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the k@@ de ; -@@ Ger@@ ü@@ st is not only this all possible , but allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; allows web@@ developers to improve the use of intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can make the productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ rep@@ ain@@ ted promotions , scripts and tool systems . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was developed for fast web@@ design and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developer rel@@ ayed the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detail documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta perform ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access sli@@ der of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not found on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
this allows you to save code @-@ parts and all the files as templates for later use . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project prec@@ ast ners will only be reported a bug .
convert when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there enth@@ used special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ ment so that they are correctly displayed and not interpreted by the browser as a form@@ atting .
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; add which the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switch the block@@ selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of &amp; Shift ; key .
&quot; this is very helpful , if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages ! &quot;
is looking for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window where you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
and switching of the problem @-@ off on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; main window . the problem @-@ por@@ ter will be activated as soon as you switch to the structural tree .
displays the toolbar icons from the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries pre@@ diction or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; sear@@ ched the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows , e.g. video files to your project folder or sub@@ folders and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded any input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ment ; projects can be explained on the details .
&quot; loads a project tool . these are preserved in project you / tool@@ bars , and are only available in this menu if you have al@@ located to this project . &quot;
&quot; a dialog to store your toolbar . allows you to select the type of the toolbar : locally or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by means of settings , or you will be asked for the toolbar , whether you want to save the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; delet@@ es a toolbar from the point of view . delet@@ es it not from the hard disk . if you have not saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do it . &quot;
&quot; with this , you can send their own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; -@@ team so that the toolbar can be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
enables the up@@ loading of toolbar on the main server where everyone can access it . see in .
&quot; loading a D@@ TD , that you or ir@@ as anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; its own description . &quot;
&quot; loading / und@@ et@@ ric of entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful , if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , should be renewed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew . if this global is and a sp@@ ying in the global KDE folder is not available , the shop fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that exist in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard is loaded ( HTML ; ) , there is in the tags menu a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day of dialogue dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
activated or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; the inser@@ tion by means of tool ref@@ used when this day is contradi@@ c@@ ted to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu the available plugins are listed under the above @-@ listed menu points . click here . click on a activated plug @-@ ins disabled .
choose the syn@@ tac@@ tical mode for the current file . the list of available articles are depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; choose the type of pointer identification . very useful , if you know people to use the other OS platforms to wrap . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document based on selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of the user interface . by some restrictions in the KDE libraries , the switching @-@ switch can cause time or indu@@ ce mode . recommended is the cart@@ on mode , which is also the default mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . with selecting a entries , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog includes every application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the con@@ quer@@ or ; web browsers . &quot;
addresses the behavior of the editors . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar or which you can modify and follow the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help in accordance with the surroundings of the mouse cursor , but it is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free , but as with every open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; agon@@ ap@@ ing ; development in financial form you will find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explaining and should be filled out at the top from above , for example after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
here is the name for the project to enter for example foo . when entering name this file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; -@@ project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without whit@@ esp@@ ace with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the repository .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , on which one wants to access , one , except you are processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exam@@ ple@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used . depending on the setting of the remote host could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates for the project will be saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the toolbar can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ box . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . it can be selected multiple files or folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web@@ in@@ c you have to download and change . if you have any script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; let files leave , if files are to be integrated anywhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started on new , not p@@ aken . &quot;
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a detailed selection of expertise .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking or , by removing the tick , cl@@ amps out of the project . &quot;
&quot; the latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can upload profiles in the menu with project properties in the menu window , or change with the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional items are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ card possible ) which can be re@@ ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project sub@@ folders .
&quot; add option to above , also Files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are removed from the project . &quot;
the project view that is loaded at opening the project . it can be read more about project views .
&quot; thus , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the button options . in the de@@ bug@@ ging search . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles can upload high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a buil@@ du@@ ce for the content of the server for each profile , by adding a separate construction for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project requirements can be added , processed or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration , one can switch event @-@ actions and add these actions , modify or delete these actions , if a previously determined event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , you will open up the last project , which was opened . this behavior cannot be at the moment . &quot;
to open a different project you can open project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; closed , the project @-@ file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to make changes before leaving ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
&quot; the project management gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project . &quot;
&quot; folder will also act , however , the entries are opening and opening ... in with the right mouse button of the context menu : &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ set files . see .
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is ab@@ sent to prevent removing . &quot;
the password is kept in the core memory and for@@ getting around program . this possibility is useful when frequent up@@ loading files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the record option does not appear in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you want to change your opinion in front of the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing , many up@@ loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded onto different servers . when using or create a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
&quot; that is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work . &quot;
the transfer protocol for the high load . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least should you choose from &amp; FTP ; to file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your touch shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password will be stored on the record , so that it can &apos;t be easily read on the record , but each with programming know it can easily be seen at the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and toolbar . it can be loaded in a project a lot of views , i.e. by simply exchange of view , different files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the current files and toolbar . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened in the menu or the project toolbar , accessible via settings of the toolbar &apos;s toolbar , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; to its own way of working . &quot;
as mentioned above are the toolbar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; best about the menu toolbar . use and adding differ . the adding of toolbar can be handled below in the section adding of the toolbar .
&quot; the toolbar and the symbols can be adjusted either via context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , other actions can be set as the toolbar , which can be specified in the dialog , which can be specified where actions on this or other toolbar can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to a action ( icon ) on a toolbar , additional entries are to be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explaining . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up and set up actions in the menu with settings ... and set up actions ..
&quot; templates are in essential documents , code cut@@ lets and files for link@@ ups . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; uses templates in principle as a m@@ ative file system with expan@@ sive organisation and interfaces . they can copy , move or any of the system available in the for@@ en@@ camp@@ ed tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; in about the restrictions you have chosen for the fil@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template before using .
&quot; binary is all , which is not pure text . it can be added any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents using link@@ ups ( e.g. photos with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pre@@ stor@@ ing tree under global templates . for more information on the Templates tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created by any text type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , specialized documents in corresponding sub@@ folders . you can be found a simple straight@@ way for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . see for more information about the templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful when not a new document is to be inserted based on a template , but the same text area always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment via a final note on Javascript or Perl base . see for more information on the templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , serve these templates for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , together in a compres@@ sed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to Beli@@ ever ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file As a template save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this has happened , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project location ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the fore@@ front tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click on File As a template , select the selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with drag@@ ging and spread the comp@@ ute templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a sub@@ folder folder . it can be used to use all the file administration functions , such as drag@@ ging and v@@ egen or inser@@ ting over the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click in the file tree or project management files to a folder on the right and secure site template , and by default will be assured in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates will enable very specific to access . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ prints , or connect dynam@@ ically with PHP ; in addition , you can keep some things in the use of templates in projects very deep . &quot;
&quot; the structure @-@ structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as above . &quot;
to set the behaviour of a folder and click the folder overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; Files , text or templates . this selection is cancelled , as soon as El@@ ter@@ ative attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything apart from the regular folders . if a regular folder would be set , it would appear to be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text box . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder . &quot;
allows you to customize or edit text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ print for all templates for a particular project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ prints a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / base lines .
&quot; in addition , we also have a context menu ( on show , right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor which can be accessed via the menu View . the first mode replaced the HTML Editor in two parts : the HTML Editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it does not load a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or X@@ HTML ; - page and a cursor . then you can edit it , and when needed to source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL image editor will be visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL , Editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , the source text editor is necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just as the first , except that at the same time changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ized . with wir@@ es of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , enables the key@@ press to the active cursor from one window to the other , where the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the synchron@@ isation stand between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor you set up via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ view can be set between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation is set to be set . basically the recommendation applies : a small sp@@ anne for fast calcul@@ ators and a great sp@@ anne for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select the title of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor possible . this is used for the reduction of the suspension of the &quot; &quot; V@@ PL &quot; &quot; Editor . this means that it is intended to change the reduction of the suspension . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ a @-@ Tags , the storage of information about the document yourself e.g. keywords available for Internet search engines . Met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two buttons at the bottom or removed . a click on the list allows modification of content , such as keywords on the column name and key@@ word key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the appear@@ ence of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change on the list is possible precisely like with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the Edit of CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style , by pressing the file button and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the cursor is like in a text processing , possible by cont@@ ent@@ ment with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor is strange . the mark@@ ings works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ed and remove it by back@@ taste or remove c@@ aste . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be made in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source editor , e.g. if an anchor day already exists , e.g. if an anchor day , surrounded with text , each other surrounding anchor has to be removed . &quot;
some toolbar such as the tables Assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will later be used in &amp; V@@ PL . they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists have to be used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style templates . in contrast to other programs for style templates the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the style can be trac@@ eable .
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compile it , except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already present . &quot;

&quot; there are many graphical tools for the same . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me tell me just why I wrote . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ duction was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time had corrected many places in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in the merger . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what was changed inside these lines , and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only those changes had changed . the cor@@ relation of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; so , this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a row and changes to white signs . later , any quantity of further useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; if you like to compare for example fast text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the previous window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and cor@@ ding of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser .
&quot; even 3 @-@ way @-@ connections will be fully supported . this is useful when two persons can work independently of one piece of co@@ de and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps the dis@@ integration of conflicts and displays at the same time the original file . in this editor you can even edit the result . the screenshot shows three quantum files on the assem@@ bling : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ isons and to @-@ perform folders . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder assem@@ bling :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and ren@@ oun@@ ces the possibilities of hy@@ bri@@ dal color monitors . if you need to check out Ko@@ de , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ulators are visible . when lines are visible only in a certain number of white signs , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no hass@@ le more if J@@ em@@ and the inser@@ tion changes . ) &quot;
&quot; when one file is equal , and the other is different from one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both of them differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can ease the ti@@ lage work by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example : &quot;
3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
&quot; the opening dialog allows the manual of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or the selection of a recently opened file out of the list . the opening dialog takes you next time . you do not have to send the entry for C , the analysis of the differences is done with two files . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons and assem@@ bling of folders . if for a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if interaction is crossed , the input field becomes active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to set out a output file . you can also get this step later on stor@@ ing . &quot;
the set @-@ up button will open a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before you start using the compar@@ isons / merger .
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the comparison starts then immediately . in opening dialog you have to select no files , you can simply complete the dialog with the Cancel button . &quot;
&quot; you can also use drag@@ ging and en@@ closures , simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor , and let it drop through a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you &apos;re looking like these functions , it would only compare two appropriate files , they would simply upload two appropriate files , they would simply copy and compare them . now you can simply copy and compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you can not pull nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case of text into a compar@@ ative window will be supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the drag@@ ging and en@@ closures of text into another program as a cut and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info @-@ line has a while on the line . then a small hel@@ per window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is Mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees in the color that different files differ . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is very useful in the next section ( merger ) well . &quot;
&quot; links beside the text is the combination column . if differences have been found , the column shows the corresponding color . when differences in white signs the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. are white signs only in character and comments , relevant for the processor and in a few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that bur@@ ns the abstr@@ action column of text , is interrupted by the places where the particular source file is activated . if the line @-@ switch is activated , the line is dot@@ ted to the surrounding lines . &quot;
&quot; result window ( among the compar@@ ative windows ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; changed &#93; if you have dealt the result . usually , it contains by automatic interaction already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are loos@@ ened ! ! ( use the buttons to least most resolved / ung@@ el@@ ian conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ ative windows can be used , each difference is also resolved at the same time a conflict which must be manually solved . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is not visible . ) This group will then be highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each of the left appears a black beams . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , by the automatic switch , or by manual editing no further line exists in the group ; then this is only a plac@@ id for the event that you can change your opinion and perhaps another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ ings you may copy and elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; break@@ down fli@@ gt ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go careful with this feature . &quot;
note : if in selecting the sources the options ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ers C / C + + comments are subject to change in numbers or comments as well as white signs .
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly used with the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows you can use the arrow button next , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w like you can also be used by other programs . the over@@ s column next to the vertical image bar can be used by simply click the nav@@ y . &quot;
in the eye @-@ window you can also use the other keys to edit . with the insert button you can switch between entry and over@@ write mode . ( pres@@ et is the inser@@ ting mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the combination columns is synchron@@ ized the view of all windows to the top of each group ( as already in the section assem@@ ble and the ed@@ itable output window was explained ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the latest / first / last difference ( str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , must be considered between sol@@ dered and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or shr@@ g inser@@ ting ) . if this option is automatically copy , automatically to the clip@@ board and manually copy the manual copying . be careful with this option but you could write so the content of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; for@@ cing are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variations use a line @-@ line label \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use W@@ agen@@ sti@@ r \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the pointer of source files not , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; the options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu settings , &gt; K@@ 0@@ 3 set up ... ) &quot;
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog sets also writings with vari@@ ability to choose from , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ si@@ ver font . if the script does not support this representation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed correctly . on these systems the button settings automatically provides an odd color . &quot;
if this option is activated is inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator button the appropriate number of spaces are inserted . otherwise a tab@@ ulator character is inserted .
&quot; when you write or return , the ind@@ em@@ ulation of the pres@@ et line is automatically used for the next line . &quot;
if this option is activated automatically each selection is automatically copied into the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board .
you can choose which shows @-@ type you prefer to save . the most important value is the generally usual selection of the operating system used .
&quot; at the compar@@ isons of files tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files can be found . only during this first step , white signs can not be ignored . in this step white signs are not ignored . even when inter@@ rup@@ ed white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a pointer mark , but then you could differ files with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison , however , like a white sign , however , it needs to be disabled . during the merger , this option must be disabled . in the pres@@ et@@ ting this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the pres@@ et@@ ting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are displayed , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
in the pres@@ et@@ ting this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intense after still smaller differences . the option is activated in the pres@@ et@@ ting . it is effective for complicated and large files but slowly with very large files .
&quot; in the automatic continuous mode , this setting is determined how long the outcome of the choice will be shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict is going forward . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re dis@@ solving all conflicts in white signs by selecting the selected file as a source . ( pres@@ et is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you &apos;re just about time to time , then use better the functions of W@@ äh@@ le A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options must ignore or ign@@ ori@@ er C / C + + -@@ comments . &quot;
these options are dealt with in Chapter for scanning of folders and penetration of a combination . look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and con@@ duction .
&quot; when a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version exists the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already there is a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , this without any further backup will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; change the language of the user interface . change this option does not affect the current running program . you need to stop &amp; diff@@ use , so that the change is actively supported . ( this option is in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set globally via the control center . ) &quot;
the following en@@ coding settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you have this option is used for all entries the upper setting .
&quot; via the selection of the code for the coding appears a short note , which is the local code . ( this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you . ) &quot;
customize the file en@@ coding for source files . this influences how special characters can be treated and interpret . as the coding for each file can be individually controlled can even be compared with different en@@ coding and be merged .
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding to save it . &quot;
&quot; if you define stock commands , they might not function with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be loaded with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing command . &quot;
turn it off to press post@@ ings of changes in white signs in the text or over@@ look . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options must ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ers C / C + + -@@ comments activated . )
&quot; this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a color@@ fully codi@@ fied over@@ s column appears . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . according to the selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is shown next to the normal yet another over@@ s column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . Bl@@ end simply the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
ranks the compar@@ ative windows side by side or floo@@ ded . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click does not compare the file name and used the file name for the output file . ( if this function is used to start the link again , then the name of the last used output will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; in reading a file it will first commit to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own preferences that is exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ em@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it was first entered at this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command processor command . the output of the command is used only when displaying the command line . you can only assign your own preferences that meets your requirements . each input line must have a associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when set up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program yourself . the good news is however that in most cases sed or perl . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for rec@@ orders to convert : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ 1 / &apos; The . * is an erg@@ ul@@ ary expression that relates to each string . \ \ 1 in the first gear ratio refers to the found text in case letters . the \ \ U trans@@ forms the found text in big letters .
&quot; CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ ing control systems use some key@@ word ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Log \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ ( \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like this regular expression even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . however , it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ process installed . sed / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is deleted by nothing , thus quasi . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several conver@@ sions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other .
instead you can also have something different like perl to . perl -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; allergi@@ es are needed by perl some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires perl only ( and ) without the leading &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after normal Pre@@ processor will be kept for viewing and to assem@@ ble . the other operations only change the data that see the pointer of al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the line @-@ processor controls the output of the normal price processor as a input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmer need to edit programmers in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge . &quot;
... makes for every object a suggestion for interaction ; you can customize the proposal before starting .
can be sim@@ ulate and demonstrates the sim@@ ulated changes without having to perform them
&quot; select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and composition of individual files very similar . you just need to open folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folder will be merged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no target is specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not run the inter@@ c@@ ture . to start the link , you must press the respective menu entry or push the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; during the reading of the folder you will inform you a small news window on current progress . if you break the folder scanning , only the files are listed until then . &quot;
&quot; when the scanning of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side ... &quot;
each file and any folder that was found during the scan will be shown here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is normally shown together . you can double a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or clicking on the object , or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the folder menu contains two functions , which you can find all folders and folders . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a file , the file will be started and it appears a compar@@ ative window . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail@@ ing window to the selected object . in such a case the cl@@ adding action can not be selected automatically . if the merger will be started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above image is to be seen in the columns A / B / C , colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders will be considered as the same as its entire content is identical . then , folders also have the same color . in folders , the age is un@@ significant for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is only green , then yellow is and later , when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C not have the same type of data ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : contradi@@ c@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the cor@@ relation cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : contradi@@ c@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist may not be started .
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folder and no explicit target group were specified and if the option directories is synchron@@ ized . then sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action made , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical are : merge and result in both folders . ( the user looks as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly after the merger copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders will be combined and select the new file instead of composition ( uns@@ afe ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange cannot be eliminated , the mer@@ ging of the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merger , a file after another worked out . you place a file after another when the assem@@ ble successfully was successful , and according to other announ@@ cements when the merger has been completed , you should make a last review and check if the status is everywhere in order . &quot;
&quot; if in the dialog dialog the file method is elected , K@@ diff@@ 3 further columns . these include the number of Com@@ for@@ ter , rede@@ emed , not wh@@ ys and white conflicts . ( the column for rede@@ emed conflicts will only appear if three folder is compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the assem@@ ble @-@ actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run the inter@@ c@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no target folder , then will be used in the three @-@ folder assem@@ bling mode C as the target , using the two @-@ folder assem@@ bling becomes B as the target and sync A and / or B as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries can be displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ ador@@ able surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : choose directory together / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to use only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by contradi@@ c@@ tory file types there are still invali@@ d inter@@ led actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you perform all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options to sim@@ ulate and break . &quot;
&quot; choose if you just want to see what will happen , without which really changes you will be made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) , then will pop up a link window ( note the screenshot window ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are ready with a file , select again directories / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you do not yet have saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in an error you see a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you see some error messages , which can help you choose the cause of the problem . so you have the option to choose another action for the entry or to resolve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the merger . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually combined , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and execute them together at the later date . even if here the inter@@ rup@@ tions or not been saved , these entries are considered settled . only when you change the merger action , these entries will again be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called folder assem@@ bl@@ ings with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid Plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( such as * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders correspond to that pattern are not displayed in the element tree ; it can be more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et@@ ting is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders correspond to that pattern are not displayed in the element tree ; it can be more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et@@ ting is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that can also be ignored by CV@@ S . many autonom@@ ous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder is specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) .
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a ver@@ ine attri@@ bute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a item is referred to as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in the default . &quot;
&quot; when links to files : if the option is de@@ activated , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched , the files are compared to which the links are shown . this is disabled in the pres@@ et@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; when left on a folder : if the option is de@@ activated , the links are switched and recur@@ sively insp@@ ect . a link to a folder that contains a link to yourself , it would lead to an end loop and cr@@ ashes . ) This option is de@@ activated in the pres@@ et@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; exec@@ uting a complete analysis of each file and shows the statistics of statistics . ( the number of resolved , non @-@ mon@@ ast@@ eries , non@@ - wh@@ ys and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , and essentially s@@ lower when they contain files that does not contain text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; when you compare a large folder of a slow network , it may be quicker , only to compare the change of the date and file size . however , this speed will cost you however a certain level of security . please with caution . this option is switched on in the default . &quot;
&quot; similarly , as familiar with the change of change . there is no real comparison instead . the files will be equally important when copying to the change of change . please with caution . this option is switched on in the pres@@ et@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ izing mode if two folder is compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals are identical to co@@ operating . also the results from the combination of files are stored in both folders . this option is de@@ activated in the pres@@ et@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered un@@ certain that the other file was not changed too . you should consider this in any case . ) This option is de@@ activated in the pres@@ et@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; when a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension exists , this is also associated with the .@@ ori@@ g extension . this also applies to the regular combination of individual files , not only the cor@@ ding of single folder . this option is switched on in the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder view can be visible from the assem@@ ble of individual files ; you can switch the shut@@ ters with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window @-@ window in the window menu and switch the window @-@ window in the window menu and switch the switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , you can also launch a single file from the merger menu . once you save the result , the status will be completed and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status goes lost if you enter the directory again : directory -@@ menu : new one Read more &quot;
KDE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to opening up on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compres@@ sed arch@@ iv@@ s with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . some things you should consider :
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs not possible , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special sign must be mas@@ ks . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank character &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ es@@ ystem on the server , sometimes by using the protocol . it follows a brief list of restrictions : &quot;
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is accepted as a link @-@ target . ( FTP : : SF@@ TP : ) .
there is no possibility to process eligi@@ bility or change of modification . hence the eligi@@ bility or change of the original date from the original . ( note the option confidential ) of the original . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
&quot; the main purpose purpose is currently being the differences in K@@ Devel@@ op . K@@ Devel@@ op first always starts the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , click the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files , takes a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then accepts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can preview a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . the assem@@ bling or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist it comp@@ are ) there are already . moreover , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can lead to the program diff@@ use 3 out of the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL @-@ programs already very long and have learned a lot when I used to my sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go to it .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably does not have the correct pre@@ fix to KDE released . in the pres@@ et@@ ting install configure in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs are different , these lines will be treated as identical , however , the line is not identical as identical . if however , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this supplement is not dence but this is not the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor is noted for any difference in the files where it starts and where he ends . this is necessary to resolve a conflict easily by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is however lost when the result is simply saved as text file , and it &apos;s a lot of effort to store this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit bigger amounts of text should be used to use another editor .
after removing text suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; appeared and the text cannot be clear . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to distinguish between differences . even more flo@@ ating would be conf@@ us@@ ingly and mis@@ ery the purpose . use it for another editor .
many good ideas and trou@@ bles came from colleagues and many people from the game Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage .
&quot; a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log , or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ dir are the folder in your system in which KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have problems in comp@@ iling . should nonetheless arise difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing lists thereof . &quot;
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copies the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( Str@@ g @-@ V or Shift ) adds the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or re@@ places the current market position .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you will need to update these options to the folder with the function Update . )
&quot; there are only entries displayed , the differences exist . this also results that identical files when connecting do not be copied into the target folder . ( the behavior will probably be cancelled after the merger . ( the behaviour is likely to be modified in a later program version . ) This option is de@@ activated in a later program version . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already existing ) . if the lines are already present , they are automatically removed when clicking the button . &quot;
in the pres@@ et@@ ting this option is disabled . Under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ show of all virtual work@@ spaces . it &apos;s quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ space to change their size , they stop or move it . this works both inside a desktop and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces , as well as in the current applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the work@@ space and to others . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a work@@ space and on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button will be cli@@ cked , when on an empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click here , the context menu has left only the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries , maxim@@ ize , on work@@ space and end . the following commands will make the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . it appears only when it was click on an application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . it only appears when it was click on an application .
&quot; this indicates is marked , windows can be moved inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces are moved . &quot;
&quot; when this box is crossed , are shown in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work@@ spaces are shown . &quot;
&quot; cross this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual des@@ ktops . it is displayed together with name , the names of Or@@ din@@ al@@ erts are provided , &amp; eg ; 1. work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each work@@ space is also shown as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this box is crossed , the running programs will be shown as little windows at the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty fields are shown to make their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angle with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the order of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be determined : classic is known &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; used in a 2x@@ n @-@ r@@ aster , such as from P@@ ager applications in some other Window@@ ages ; wa@@ ist shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal and vertical pattern in a sen@@ k@@ right series , which is very good for the representation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager @-@ Mini@@ Program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can display in the size , view the windows as symbols or with their content , and it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent to choose switch @-@ switch ... lets the dialog appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog &apos;s settings . but you can do this manually :
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ . if you have no des@@ ks for the file , you must register as a user root or register to your system administrator . in this file you have to assign the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and add value to this one value . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of the KDE basic package . &quot;

&quot; is a very powerful application , which is continually expanded by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
if you &apos;ll launch a window as above . the main window of &amp; km@@ ag ; displays the enlarged range of the screen . below is shown this window as a larger window ; the picture that is shown in the larger window is an enlarged range of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
&quot; in the default setting enlarged &amp; km@@ ag , the area around the mouse pointer like a movable magni@@ fying lens . alternatively , you can illustr@@ ate a selected screen in the larger window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the screen ( eg ; at the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid that the mouse pointer in the enlarged window will be displayed , select the setting of the mouse pointer . please note that the mouse button is still not able to recognize the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the default size ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse pointer . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window onto your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
move the mouse pointer to enlarge and keep the left mouse button pressed so you can switch the content of the magni@@ fier window and move it to the arrow keys .
&quot; if you are additionally to press &amp; Shift ; key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . notice that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ window remains fixed and only the lower right corner to move . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ ag ; has a lot of functions . you can then send the enlarged image directly to the printer to paste into a file , to insert the clip@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , the image and much more . &quot;
&quot; starts or stops the update of the display . you can update the upgrade , that the required CPU time goes against 0 . &quot;
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very small , sc@@ oring , medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode a selection window appears . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&quot; and km@@ ag , automatically uses your entered short command to save files , opening a new window , prints , new@@ com@@ ers ( with the button @-@ button again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ larger and mer@@ gers &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier , is a screenshot of the screen . you can use a section of the screen , so as if you use a magni@@ fying glass to see the small print in a paper or a photo . this application is suitable for different people of benefits : from research or artists to the web designer or vision@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse @-@ click , once the mouse pointer is fe@@ ather@@ ed a while on the same spot . it &apos;s meant to help people suffer the rep@@ eti@@ tive strain of the jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse @-@ click pain@@ s . besides , it can em@@ ulate the drag@@ ging with the mouse . however , this requires a bit of exercise . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can use the pain , which is created when clicking the mouse and helps us to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you are suffering from the use of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to be able to put it once again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain@@ s helps to be caused by clicking the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by pressing the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic aids that apply : the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads one mouse @-@ click away as soon as you break the movement shortly .
&quot; is the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it will run the pressing of the mouse button . in this way , you can run the drag@@ ging of the mouse button . in this way , you can run the drag@@ ging of the mouse button . this allows you to run the drag@@ ging into a little exercise , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; this verse period must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; is smart@@ ly shif@@ ted , the turning @-@ off @-@ time ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting before the mouse button is waiting again , if the mouse button again will get rid of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now this function is enabled , creates a slow relief for right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a long @-@ click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stream / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stream _ config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can cut &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the reaction times there . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der Sound bu@@ ffer that you want to decrease to a lower value to shor@@ ten the answer times . &quot;
&quot; this setting marks , a km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this feature is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available in GNO@@ ME or other window environments , please click the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program . &quot;
&quot; sets all the settings back to the values indicated by opening the dialogue . have you already pressed the button below , the settings are reset to the last wir@@ es of An@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the preferences . in particular , the intelligent delay should then be off first . if you then click to the automatic mouse click , you can later use the intelligent delay . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may also be necessary to decrease the answers from &amp; k@@ de ; by sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not display the mouse on such sites until you would like to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse rests , you should puri@@ fy your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick allows you to clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear , however , if you see the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have the ball away , you would need to see the roles . these are connected to the sides of the hole , into which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the fingers . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks down the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just started a shooting range . if you are in this case the intelligent use , means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . the surgery can no longer end with the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under another window manager will use and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you can run a mouse click . thus , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; return and you can continue to work as usual . &quot;
problem : if you enter text not tried &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and puts the cursor to another place .
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor on the cursor where you want to have it . but , if you don &apos;t want to give you the mouse on a neutral area of working space , if you do not encounter a button . secure zones for the mouse pointer are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart moving , but I don &apos;t change it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent function is an advanced feature of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time to copy it in this way . it &apos;s most probably possible to copy it into the clip@@ board or to insert any other action in which you are allowed to move the mouse with pressing mouse button . however , there will probably be some advice on this : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t just use the intelligent delay , if you just start using the km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . select text instead , run at the end of the text area a mouse click , while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and keep the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , each button is playing a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when in smart moving the delay time begins . later , you can also use the intelligent delay even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case in most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound@@ card and speaker and it is correct .
&quot; and km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; bet@@ we@@ ar@@ ded the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer short . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome , and those of those of the Mau@@ sta@@ sten pain is prepared . &quot;
&quot; the km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as it is a certain time is waiting that a drag@@ ging process begins , before the mouse button will release . in this way , the drag@@ ging and en@@ closures with the mouse can be performed . &quot;

&amp; km@@ outh ; is a program with the mu@@ te user can be able to speak their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh , users can drop the computer to speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk on propositions which should once again be talked . &quot;
on the first side of the wiz@@ ard ( lin@@ kes screenshot ) enter the command that will be used later for the voice &apos;s version . further details can be found in the description of the interior design .
on the second page you can choose the default text text@@ book . from the text@@ books you can often choose text passages without having to incorporate them . the text pass@@ codes can of course be processed .
&quot; on the third page ( right screenshot ) determine the dictionary for the vocabulary . &amp; km@@ outh ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can write the list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words into the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clearly arranged and contains basically a input field for the keyboard gift of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a dis@@ course of the already spoken sent@@ ences ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you have km@@ outh ; correct , you can enter in the input field , which you want to listen . each locked set will be attached to the dis@@ course memory . you can choose from these propositions which are again spoken . &quot;
&quot; associated with the menu item Settings Tr@@ outh , setup ... open the dialogue dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; . this dialog contains two boxes , language version and settings , the page of Wor@@ ter@@ ment as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the cart@@ on menu , enter the command to call for voice generator . in the drop @-@ field under the input field you place the character coding , with the text to be passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ outh ; knows two types to pass the text . select the starter box when the text should be distributed as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ box is not selected , the text is distributed as parameters . you can use the following Plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to the voice &apos;s voice depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; as a fe@@ a@@ thing as a language service is used &amp; km@@ outh will continue to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . if this is successful , the further settings on this page is being developed and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection of action , after selecting a text recording , select which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text text@@ book or in the bar for text@@ book books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text tracks are directly spoken and in addition to the dis@@ course memory is attached . with the selection of in the input field , the selected text tracks will initially be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection of the machining panel for text pass@@ codes , you can specify , whether the text@@ book can be automatically saved by the closing of the machining window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pass@@ codes , the book will be saved . if you choose changes , the text pass@@ angers will not be saved . select on saving inquiries , the text pass@@ codes will be saved . &quot;
the Page Wor@@ ter@@ supplement contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window beside the input field shows &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection box when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field you can select the currently used dictionary for vocabulary .
&quot; with the buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books , or export them into a file . below the list , you can adjust the name and in the drop @-@ box language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation one . the frequency of the individual words will simply be measured by lowering the issue . additionally , you can add the wording with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to just enter the new dictionary into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh , asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are brought together , and how these weight@@ ed are to be combined . &quot;
&quot; with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ outh ; newly entered words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window is divided into two parts . in the upper part the text@@ books are presented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text tour , you can change the text tracks or associated keyboard short@@ listed , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text messages or books add or select text messages and books , you can either reach either the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar or via a folding menu . &quot;
the order of text pass@@ agen@@ ers or text passages you can change through drag@@ ging the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the keys and the old ; key .
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it is used otherwise , the selected areas of the cre@@ atic storage . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it is used otherwise , the selected areas of the cre@@ atic storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the contrac@@ tor is used . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , the toolbar compatible with buttons for frequently used commands . the toolbar can be arranged directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the lock @-@ left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another point . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed is a narrow foot in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; km@@ outh , shown if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , is a shif@@ ting bar for text pass@@ codes using entries . by mouse @-@ click on the toolbar left and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another point . &quot;
&quot; probably you have the command for the voice of the voice is not correct or not completely entered . open settings , open settings and enter the command for voice output on the map . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer to further details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a langu@@ ag@@ ram system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is supported . the license allows you to use festival free of charge without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; in order to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice &apos;s output , is assumed that festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to the voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; gr@@ ated language generator . currently , he only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and to pass without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice &apos;s output , is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ ading . language version is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option does not have to be switched as default . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; M@@ BRO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to make the text in ph@@ eme . the license allows to use M@@ BRO@@ LA for free for non commercial and non @-@ commercial applications . &quot;
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into Ph@@ on@@ eme for M@@ BRO@@ LA with the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and M@@ BRO@@ LA in / usr / local / ha@@ di@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed .
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax will gladly take the last character of the text so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / mb@@ ro@@ la / mb@@ ro@@ la / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the option data as default must be switched on .
&quot; the voice @-@ issue Dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , the all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications provides a standard interface for voice &apos;s output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; as the setting of the voice generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use as a kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; km@@ outh . &quot;
&quot; to setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service , which is installed in the dialogue dialog by &amp; km@@ outh , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; requires around 15 MB memory ( and additional storage for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; the km@@ outh is an application , with the people who can not speak text by the computer . it is already saved a list of already pro@@ chen@@ er propositions which the users can always leave again new again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh does not include a language syn@@ thesizer . on the computer it needs to be a syn@@ thesizer .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / km@@ outh ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start the help@@ center help : / km@@ outh ) .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice of the voice system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a set of modules of existing service , which allows every application to make text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a partial system in &amp; k@@ de ; for the voice of voice ( T@@ TS ) , there is a common use interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programmer ready to be equipped with the whose applications with T@@ TS abilities . also the users offers it interesting options . &quot;
reading of texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; even if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; treatments is embedded .
&quot; the language version takes place via the program Speech disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows production of language messages on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ auxiliary program .
&quot; in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Speech @-@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the Language @-@ Station service of &amp; k@@ de ; , a application without visible windows , the T@@ TS @-@ Services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setting up kt@@ on t@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the navig@@ ator &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the text of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; that can be read completely or in part with the text file .
&quot; additionally to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions on https : / / mail@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / email / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essibility . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essibility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use , you need to install and adjust program Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as yet no spok@@ es@@ person are established , the card @-@ card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card will be shown . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , so also different mascul@@ ine or feminine , or such that distingu@@ ishes itself in volume or speed . they can also set several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . they should at least use a speaker , before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , since the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise use the standard speakers . &quot;
different spok@@ es@@ men for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several print hoses for the same printer .
if you click on the cart@@ on cart@@ oons in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card @-@ card is displayed . this also appears automatically when you place a kt@@ t@@ gr and yet no spok@@ es@@ person is established . &quot;
all the already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speakers will be used for voice &apos;s voice if an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list below . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; target system ;
&quot; here you select a voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a junk@@ er and girl@@ sa to choose from . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , appears on the new speaker on the map controller . to change the settings of this microphone , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the map menu and check whether the T@@ TS @-@ service of &amp; k@@ de ; start . now , you can use it ; use text to read and manage text . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have established at least one speaker , you can launch the language system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map of the map , to open this map card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this topic in order to enable the target ; this start is successful , the map list will be displayed and you can create text presentations , and you can create text presentations , and you can proceed . remove the mark@@ ings , becomes K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ on ; continue , provided the field voice version is crossed ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; this Annex field marks and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears in advance automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre@@ text has been completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start texture stretching , stop , stop and resume . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
&quot; click on An@@ gle or OK , all the modified settings will be adopted on all sides . &quot;
the card @-@ card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD click on the cart@@ els ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the shown website . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ts . then , select the text , which should be read , and select in the main menu tools Text read . after a short time the voice should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pres@@ tr@@ ash and other invisible brands are also pre@@ viewed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ ate ; the enhanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can preview the text shown here . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs first . select then the text , which should be read , and select in the main menu Tools Text . then the voice should start . &quot;
this also works when &amp; K@@ ate ; in other applications is embedded as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ;
&quot; K@@ NO@@ fy is the communication system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can notify you of the text of these news , even by &amp; kt@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up a message when in an IR@@ C channel a message appears , where your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ on ; then you can then read the IR@@ C @-@ direc@@ tion@@ ext . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry is released in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for drawing the label offer a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; heard , is a good example . you remove the tags br and b from the news that can be sent by mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since this in most cases be accepted as provided . read also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed that it is sent to the program Speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the language to choose wrong language and speaker , or to select a suitable language and speaker , or to deal with certain short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &quot;
the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be applied to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the issue of the Screen reader is pre@@ viewed , the entered orders will be continued again . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor will be too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example for an application that can be used . while you get a long text on a web page , you can start with &amp; km@@ outh , who just follow the room . &amp; k@@ de ; Al@@ erts are also News . read here . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text presentations . every order , which you encounter by the card orders , is a text@@ book . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text presentations . text presentations are intended for the issue of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , with the exception of the issue of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , during &amp; kt@@ ts ; just a pre@@ reads , this issue is stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text presentations as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
filter Edit the text and enter it on the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be further species of filters .
&quot; alternatively , you can replace parts of a text by other text . thus , you can assign either as words or as a regular expression . &amp; kt@@ on ; is used with pre@@ defined strings as : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better compreh@@ en@@ sible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to a different format . delivery of &amp; X@@ HTML files are included in the SS@@ ML file .
&quot; with Interphone sel@@ ections you can select orders on the contents of the text or subject to the program , sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set the text to a spok@@ es@@ man , you can read text by KDE News about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filter has adjustable rules , after which he is used for a voice &apos;s voice . if the filter is determined that his rules does not apply , he gives the text down to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text@@ book , a message , warning or one &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications transmitted to &amp; kt@@ ts ; will send it by all the activated filters , which are arranged on the side below . the processing by the filter takes place in the sequence from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this displays the list of furnished normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter , select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following furnishings . &quot;
&quot; if you need a list of words or regular expression , these patterns will be found in the text then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . large and small @-@ speed is not observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; type your filter a name for your filter . you can choose one name , it just needs to distinguish themselves from the name of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expression . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replace it in accordance with the strings from the column . the list is shown in the sequence from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular excer@@ pts from a file to save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file is attached to the available list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is only used when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select several languages if you click in the mouse click the mouse button mouse button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is only used when the text is used by one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by Com@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID of course provides you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must be taken away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 is shown , you may only copy . &quot;
&quot; the string filter is used only then on the text when all conditions are used with an entry in the box . all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
in comparison of words used the label filter Reg@@ ular phrases in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be bo@@ unded by means of partition ( spaces ) .
&quot; in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expression . if you have installed &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sing &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; phrases can be found in the package . &quot;
&amp; XML ; trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from a format to a different format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such surveys . it can only be installed on your system . auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environmental variable PAT@@ H , is also sufficient x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; with Interphone optional filter you can send texts to a particular speaker , which is established on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example set the text by k@@ mail from a female voice to be read . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text by the filter gives it a speaker for the text . the speaker is chosen by the spok@@ es@@ person , which gives the text to the text ; send the text to the spok@@ es@@ person . with the spok@@ es@@ person filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied , if the text is applied to the specified regular expression . is installed on your System of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ator &amp; # 160 ; phrases , you can access it with one click on the button to get help with entering the button . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you place the characteristics of the desired spok@@ es@@ person . if the text shown the above filter conditions , the speaker will be chosen to indicate the desired requirements on the test . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your microphone settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the microphone filter is only applied to the text , if all conditions are applied to a entry in the box . you need to apply at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the voice &apos;s voice API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer l@@ end their applications T@@ TS @-@ skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the syn@@ thesizer can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that a syn@@ thesizer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of the voice &apos;s output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
&quot; applications call for language services on the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ on via the object K@@ Speech . &quot;
&quot; here , text of the text is available for reading and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands :
&quot; open two &amp; kon@@ sole ; -@@ windows . start a kt@@ on in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Shift filters , but when using the module for festival , web pages are not pre@@ viewed . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in the Festival 1,@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so you don &apos;t have to use SA@@ B@@ LE , so you don &apos;t have to use this voice to read about web sites . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and using the environmental variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sent@@ ences are ski@@ pped or only gib@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option is drawing to the right value for the respective language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string device . &quot;

the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the Ent@@ wr@@ apping files for the program &quot; Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source context , refer to the source file or have downloaded the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your language syn@@ thesizer correctly . for this you can use the shell script @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; which is used the program Speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so further , that the establishment of Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible directly and the script of the SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text will be depos@@ ited in individual propositions . the user may return , or desc@@ end back , repeat the output to stop or v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; if an application is text on board ; however , you can request the properties of the preferred spok@@ es@@ person for the issue . thus , an application is chosen for example , whose language English and his gender feminine is used , otherwise , it is automatically chosen the best suitable speaker . if you choose to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker will be chosen , see you in accordance with . &quot;
if you click on the map telling speaker to add or edit a speaker to the list or click Edit button . as an example is shown below the establishment of the module for festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is contained in PAT@@ H you just need to enter festival .
&quot; select the character en@@ coding for text that will be delivered to festival . by votes , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this option is automatically made . general is that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders you put volume , speaker speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and this gray list , the voice of you selected these settings will not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes require to be loaded on account of their size several seconds . if you mark this An@@ kreu@@ z@@ feld , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( when larger memory ) the first set will be syn@@ thesi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ box can not be selected , you still have no spok@@ es@@ person ( or do not forget to click An@@ gle ) . &quot;
&quot; this Annex field marks , is visible at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the program window . otherwise , after the start only the symbol is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this An@@ kreu@@ z@@ feld marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not yet running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD will read a text . therefore , you have the option to read and control it in any other way . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are specified in the queue , along with the application that set the contract , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds with the column ID on the map controller . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you will be able to enter the layout in which list below is selected or go back . ( but not every order consists of several movements ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the OK , all changes of settings ( also on other maps ) are taken over and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is cut down to the symbol in the system section . then click on this symbol to display the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , g@@ spre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here are only text presentations listed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information on the delivery types of &amp; kt@@ ts can be found here . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , a component was compiled , either with no support for the respective audio module or kt@@ on ; the necessary libraries can not load . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ asp@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output should be used , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have you selected here the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; ask the intercom speed here . 50@@ ring ; % is equivalent to approximately half and 200@@ % . % approximately the double normal talk speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click An@@ gle to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are decorated in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this map map you can set special promotions that will always be executed , if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ on ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be applied to all other orders , and holding this orders . after the issue of the Screen reader has been read , the entered orders will be resum@@ ed again . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor will be too hot . a warning will continue the issue of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning again .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web page can be read at &amp; km@@ outh , which straight out the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played , if a normal text order is interrupted . if both introductory sound as well as introductory message is active , the introductory sound is performed before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map @-@ card apply only for normal texts . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of screen re@@ ars , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , run kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card noti@@ fications will appear . &quot;
&quot; select this approach to switch the pre@@ dat@@ ors of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ disadvantage . if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and fre@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; this attitude is marked , al@@ erts when a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre@@ viewed . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or remove it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog appears in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; send if someone mentioned in an IR@@ C @-@ message your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list are nothing but ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this drop @-@ down menu to set what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event meets , you have the following choices : &quot;
&quot; if you selected the pre@@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following Plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker from which in the list on the map spok@@ es@@ person appears as the top item . see also here .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events there . is defined for a specific event of a particular application , this action is executed . otherwise , the action will run for all other events of particular application . as the last chance the action has been laid down under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button Save to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . the loaded events will start with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click delete . all entries except all directions will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for the control of voices , speaker speed , volume of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the language of for example , abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the SS@@ ML edition . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound situation in the festival configuration dialog is not on 100@@ % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and typ@@ ing limit@@ ing filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds under@@ divide text into single sent@@ ences . this makes it possible to start the first sentence orders either , or jump or stop and break down even if the language syn@@ thesizer this is not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the typ@@ ing limit@@ ing filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other typ@@ ing limit@@ ing filters , but it will be recommended . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the establishment of the microphone stations by sample , which switch on the map orders , what the spok@@ es@@ person have changed . do you have to set up some features and consider how the selection of the microphone changes . you must of course have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; and kt@@ ts ; then faster with the previous can begin , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text@@ block , which can last very long , &quot;
you will then click on map orders or cancel the map even if the language syn@@ thesizer this function is not supported .
&quot; for this reason , the normal S@@ ector &apos;s limit@@ ing filter is automatically set up if you start @-@ sm@@ gr for the first time . he can &apos;t be de@@ activated , just removed only . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
typ@@ ing limit@@ ing filters compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a sp@@ ul@@ atory sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes ( dec@@ imal code automatically removed from the text ) . please note that the standard S@@ ector limit@@ ing the character identifi@@ er .
&quot; S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( none ) , war@@ nings , messages or output of Screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
if you have removed from den@@ see the normal S@@ ector &apos;s limit@@ ing filter you can insert it again by selecting the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
on map controller Interphone you can write the microphone settings for the application . the card card will be displayed when
use of the default language ( the top on the card @-@ card speakers ) . in other words : there will be no inter@@ fer@@ mentation properties .
&quot; use of the most appropriate spok@@ es@@ person , which indicates all the characteristics of an independent speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of a spok@@ es@@ person , select &amp; kt@@ on ; otherwise chose &amp; kt@@ on ; the spok@@ es@@ person who originally entered the original features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
&quot; here you choose the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
&quot; select this topic , if the property should prevail over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when using the issue is , this property is always used as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case , where you may know the attri@@ bute language , lies before you know that a certain application text is sent in another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of speaker , most of the following are to be deleted , click on the sel@@ fs standard speakers and then use the speaker , who corresponds to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last text order in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is the input 0 required ) .
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it will be started . I have de@@ bug support , but I do not come back@@ tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is stopped and pun@@ c@@ ted . probably , you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , is possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio @-@ edition of AL@@ SA does not work when I stop using another application music . if I stop a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; con@@ sole ; appears a message , the following : free to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system the problem is that conflicts can occur at AL@@ SA , which can prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . hints for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I downloaded an extra voice for the festival on the Internet . I installed it and can use them in the festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not showing that voice .
&quot; add to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / Vo@@ ices . as a guide , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; in which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the map audio there is a adjustment speed . so this works , the program so@@ x installed and about the environmental variable PAT@@ H to be noticeable . some syn@@ thesi@@ ologists like Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice is this active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for intercom speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; has its own tags , which is controlled by either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very bra@@ ve , modify the .x@@ s@@ l @-@ file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ form @-@ filter , and set the talk speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t feel it that websites can be read using a female voice . I have established a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta don &apos;t appear to work SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER . thus the festival does not work any error that casts X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
&quot; I have added a dedicated character filter , and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ on ; no longer suit - or go back . on the cart@@ on orders the order is shown , the order is only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; points bad@@ ges ( point , Fr@@ age@@ mark , Kom@@ ma and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) you may not be fil@@ tered . use for these characters instead a filter for typ@@ ing limit@@ ing . &quot;

&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is revealed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speaker speed and pitch . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help to read them in the instructions , which can be delivered with the festival , you need to read websites you need to install ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice is using Festival 1,@@ 95 beta or new ahead . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you have to select for the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) en@@ coding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distribu@@ tions are therefore first looking for the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option en@@ coding is to be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option en@@ coding is to be set to a 8 @-@ bit k@@ yr@@ ill@@ ic as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer in cooperation with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it will take over the l@@ ex@@ ical analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ votes can be downloaded by

&quot; this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; direc@@ tional center ; that enables the management of network interface , rout@@ ing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; direc@@ tional center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings across a uniform , integrated surface . it can be called by selection of K menu , contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; _ contro@@ l@@ center ; to enable the user to create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; direc@@ tional center ; displayed . module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selection of c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured to configure the net@@ work@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the setting of the network properties .
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed at the installation of &amp; Linux ; they are installed and decorated and installed network devices later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the core version : &quot;
&quot; the module network settings will be loaded if the option is selected network settings in the &amp; direc@@ tional center ; -@@ Index selected . when starting the module network settings , this , the platform used on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can not be recognized , the pad@@ lock is offered , the platform is best to choose from the list , which is best matches . by selecting the setting no @-@ once again , the definition can be taken permanently . when the next start of network settings will then be automatically selected . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are shown grey , what does the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can click on the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three rider : &quot;
the rider network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the tab network interfaces can be carried out using the following tasks :
the settings displayed by selecting the selected network interfaces can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button . connect to the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button and displays the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings will be carried out by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP address will be carried out at the same time with the start of system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server is sending any further setting . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , selected . &quot;
with the selection Manual can be done without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field IP address the sub@@ network is specified .
&quot; this setting marks , initi@@ alizes the system the network interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desirable , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values indicated in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device .
it should be assured that the IP address in the network will not already be used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP address . with ping at the &amp; console ; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or activated depending on your needs . switch off on off @-@ off network device done by selecting from the list and click on interface ....
network devices can be activated or activated depending on demand . switching of a activated network device is carried out by selecting from the list and click of interface to de@@ activate ....
&quot; sets the IP address of the calculator in local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is available more than one network interface , the interface is to the net in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support is replacing a full domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be IP addresses . if the machine http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS BE this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3,4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the machine to the name resolution part of the equ@@ ator label enables easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered by selecting an entry and addition or down@@ grade in the list with the buttons , up or herd in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button of adding ... from the group machine to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog to New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry is then inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group computer machine to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . it is shown the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ators describes the computer @-@ address refer@@ r@@ als for the TCP / IP utility system . it is primarily used by boats when no DNS server is available , in small , dis@@ connected networks can replace the DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains a familiar machine some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os , and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . these are still in the test and version of IP to replace it in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The dialog &apos;s dialog is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known host , and enter the button &quot; &quot; Add button &quot; . if the well @-@ known host has several ali@@ as @-@ names , de button adding several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a named friend from the list and select Edit .... The dialog &apos;s dialog will edit .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK the list of static host@@ s is updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable changes , must be set in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command must be reset . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net .
for installation of binary distribu@@ tions ( usually rpm packages ) is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and installed in a &amp; con@@ sole ; using rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface as a package or installation tool for its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and k@@ de ; not , but additionally , the development packages with libraries and others needs . &quot;
&quot; this will only be recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology are given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changed configuration files . &quot;
&quot; this area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this connection , only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home - ) network con@@ veys . &quot;
&quot; currently IP networks is operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never expected great spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it is focused in the near future . this description is currently on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator who runs a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can not be chosen only at any case ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up an own little ( home ) Network , the IP address should be selected from a specifically for this purpose to avoid IP Address with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the internet , so its arbitr@@ ary use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made possible through setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks mostly addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the network mask is mostly set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers participants are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = its own computer ) . the standard route is required for the IP for@@ warding . &quot;
the mains address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP transport in the local own machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
&quot; in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distribu@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; this file will sometimes be dynam@@ ically changed at DSL connections , so it would not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than specified there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file should be sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&quot; a backup program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a band . the first purpose was to create a surface for t@@ ar that over@@ flowing out the ability of d@@ ds@@ 2@@ t@@ ar for quick , sel@@ ective packaging . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife did : how much longer does it when you ass@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be done by &amp; gt ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat : ult the band returned and reads the pre@@ ten@@ ant information of the belt . recognis@@ es &amp; b ; the pres@@ um@@ ann on the tape do not , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pres@@ enter , looks after the right index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index should be created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changing the symbol for the belt drive to indicate that the band has been mounted . in the status bar appears a corresponding message . the content of the belt can now be sear@@ ched by the sign of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before drawing up the bank@@ ment , the integration must be resolved at first . there are three methods to do this . &quot;
&quot; however , by changing the symbol for the band to realize that the integration of the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be raised without risk . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a belt @-@ types have to be form@@ atted before you can be used for saving data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting when using it , it must happen before you be form@@ atted in front of the band by &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy disk drives , it is necessary to form@@ atted a form@@ atting of the ban@@ c , DAT drives , on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; B . with the form@@ atting of the belt , all the data on the tape are lost ! after completion of form@@ atting , the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the securing files . that can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is saved only this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only those files are stored in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will be securing . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives on the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . it will only be tested the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
&quot; once the test process has started , the dialog settings for verification . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the employer for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will review . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can manage the re @-@ establish , the files you should be recovered , this can be checked on two types : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives which belong to the entry for the band@@ width . it is recovered only the selected file or sub@@ folders .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu re ....
&quot; once the recovery process has started , the dialogue settings for restoration . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ book for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will be re @-@ making . this dialog shows the progress of the start @-@ up and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the belt index file using the band@@ content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
&quot; here , a backup profile is created with the straight Files and the default settings . you can make a backup profile with the following settings : &quot;
&quot; the current working director , in which the backup is to take place . the list of securing files will be automatically updated according to your chosen working class . &quot;
&quot; for all the folder that are listed under backup files , the folder can be stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder that are stored on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , you can separately set up under backup files . each entry is considered independently of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last in@@ incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will be saved . it will only be backed up the files that have since changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the recent in@@ incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snapshot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes all files secured and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons are gt ; and lt ; lt ; Files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can set you up using the menu item KD@@ at ... in the menu Settings . the following settings allow you to make :
the full path to the device file for the band@@ man ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ por@@ ter variant of the band@@ device .
&quot; is this setting active , transm@@ its &amp; dat ; before the band is mounted the command of load to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the dro@@ pping at the belt drive . possibly this attitude does not work with all the band drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , when loos@@ ing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band is spot@@ ted . use this option not with Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ med block size for the belt drive . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you must notify &amp; gt ; in any case the block@@ size for your tape . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ atted , it writes a file at the beginning of the bank@@ ment . this file should only add a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( N By@@ te ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is computer name : seconds , where invo@@ icing of the full name of the system is , on which the band has been form@@ atted . seconds , the number of seconds have passed since the epoch has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar files that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar manage themselves . even other t@@ ar versions should work as long as it does not deal with incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup association . this symbol is only active if a band is mounted .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log , is a &amp; k@@ id ; viewers are suitable for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , the system allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is an easy representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
&quot; moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users use the fast access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log , therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions with which the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the latest version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files to format the sy@@ s@@ log @-@ Server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions also contain and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screenshot , presents &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which help the single protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tered and sort by the individual options for the sor@@ ting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book . &quot;
&quot; after starting the start &amp; k@@ system log , first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - to open the system protocol , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log . the protocol files can be found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually does not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar in order to filter the filter bar in order to filter a selected filter . in the default file , the list of the log lines will be displayed automatically in the default file . then the list of the log lines will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string list is included . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a different entry to this point . select the character process with the entries in the selected column , and enter into the filter bar the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log , all the protocol lines which have been sent or created . &quot;
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines . log lines of level errors are shown with a striking colour than protocol lines of level notice . the colored display of protocol dialog can be de@@ activated .
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system Protocol or in Cr@@ on @-@ protocol ) , so you can observe the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this may be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option To new lines in the context menu of the main window , to display all of the new upcoming record lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open an additional sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log , has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ .@@ forum @-@ so@@ ftw@@ are@@ .@@ org@@ . D@@ ort you will find further information on the supply sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion @-@ Arch@@ iv@@ s : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V in@@ it Editor , known ( and in the following as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; &quot;
&quot; the System V in@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program in the highlands of the system in the &amp; Linux , world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone can attempt to make a machine on System V in@@ it without a new installation and new format file . therefore you need to see that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service , which you want to start the system or change at another run@@ level . system services do not contain such things such as set@@ serial port , which only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should also lie in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also specify a r@@ c.@@ serial port in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel is searching for different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the default Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look at the second column and probably find that the pres@@ et run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change the previous Run@@ level 3 . if you want to change something , then you &apos;ll also fix something when you start the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it now start all the right scripts ? if you fill in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how does and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply , each of the script is so written that it accepts a argument like start and stop . you can actually launch these scripts in the command line below : &quot;
&quot; this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the one K includes , the script is called to the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server Run@@ level , which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user @-@ Run@@ level , which starts &amp; etc . , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointer is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of the available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) . &quot;
&quot; you can also move between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within a level by changing it or otherwise , the entry of its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the range of the available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you simply drag them into a new zone . to simply select copying from the menu or from the context menu and even then enter the target range , even if the same entry has already existed before the promotion area . &quot;
the sor@@ ting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the number of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service .
&quot; note : currently there is no possibility to restore entries , which have been thrown into the tr@@ ash . be so careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work areas ( dispos@@ ed system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to select a selection or below the previous ones . &quot;
to move an entry to another Run@@ level you move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X use ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a contract manually , press the button button to switch the Properties dialog box . close the dialog by clicking the button button to accept the changes , or press i@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before it will be executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings become available to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eling and now starts the machine resistant new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t l@@ inux single and press the input button to start in a single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have made some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for carrying out at Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distribu@@ tions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way of system services started in these distribu@@ tions are simpli@@ fies the configuration of the propriet@@ orial combinations of these distribu@@ tions , but does not correspond any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan a extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : please check whether all the configuration files are present ( and even if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) just end without message , when their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from Distribution to Distribution , can be used even from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this hand@@ book can be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
