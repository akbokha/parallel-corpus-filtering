<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was solar stabilisation, also Sabatier called, a effect of was created by the delicate photobstructuring of the additional light. this had the effect that lightning ranges darker and the colors made by the second illumination. this tool was an integral negatives of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar stabilisation. at about 50% intensity, the image is possible to generate what is chemically possible. a further increase is finally a negative image that is so not to generate credits."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar power supply. the original image is the (1) and the works (2). the intensity intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filters simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it is different from a saturation that makes it a stronger contrast, which makes the colors brilliant and smooth. try it easily, he emnicer many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the markname designed for one on daylight. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias greatly saturated color shades, but also some photographs make it a lot of photographen. but the characteristics of the choice for natural photographen. Velvias is also a lot of photographen. but the characteristics of the choice for natural photographer."</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrast. the parameters levels controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeating the strength of the neath. with great pictures the filter can be the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrasting of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors. all of your adjusting entries can be viewed using the result. once you are using the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can get a photo in bad light conditions. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation will gain a good choice for saturation. also in this case the tool is a good choice to increase the saturation instead of increasing. all changes you can perform in preview. if he likes the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma is the tool toner correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog on this tool acts very complicated, you need only the field of sliders. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but created especially in dark areas, grated images."</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharpness mask is working on the contrast of the edges to look a picture sharply. actually it's not a bit that works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric mess and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"possibly the best of the three, since he really improves the harness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images need a correction of sharpness. these elements are smaller than the resolution so observe a little blur. the same phenomenon can be observed if colors are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more postulated sharpation as normal cameras for the home user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG images, a camera has been applied to internal sharpening. pictures in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner address a sharpening filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable them, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can sharpable results by sharpen a photo with the sharpen footstep. this allows you to call on the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should hereby be careful, since the results are not very natural: the sharpen increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, the most important technique to sharpens the tool can be focused. under reverting you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: one image is too cold. the solution, the picture is a little soft to draw. use the tool for softening with the menu entry corrigible sofing and experiment something with settings. the forefront on the right of the dialog gives you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is blurred and is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help the image process. the forefront shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the standard values often create good results and should first be tried out. an increase in the radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you create the insharpness mask, smokers and the impression of Grates close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents one how many pixels on each side of a channel by the filter are affected. high resolution images allow greater radii. you should therefore take pictures at best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the twisted picture one of the original is added to the original. this becomes the strength of sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference level. it can thereby be used for a channel of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpen, and therefore avoided flaw in faces, celing and water-surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred wrapping filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicame; tool refocused on an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to get an image to & quot; refocussed. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. he uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filing. we can start creating better results as a blurred mask. you can launch it from the menu by drawing colors Refocused in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular base is working much better than the Gauge's folding. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which indicates the mathematical result of the original pixel, which is far from original pixel rate. the FIR of the Gauge's circuit is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular base. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures should the default value 1 good results. you can put a higher value if your image is very blurred but then on Heiligenscheine.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and date. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharptive effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filters: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. however, values are higher than 0.1. however, the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0.03. a high value is still further polluted."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche Schärfe: this is the radius for the Gauge's Schärfe. use this parameter if your insharpness is caused. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoyed artefacts. if you have a value unequal zero, so you might have to increase the correlation and / oderive filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"Matrizenas size: this value determines the size of the transformers. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially when you choose big values for the circular archipelago or the Gauß's Schärfe. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The storing as and charging buttons are used exactly for that purpose. each of any reaction parameters you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intricability corrections on the picture before you use the module. "</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture in any other way. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible are left, but later unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred mascot produces better results as sharpening. this could be caused to blur the blurred masking as a sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, you need to blur visual masks always cause artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of sharpness. for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal lineare filter. practical is the result of the FIR Wiener filter is often better than the insharpness mask. the FIR filter filter is often better in the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small focused image, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was taken with an analog camera. the focused result is due to insufficient light for the car-focus lens.</seg>

<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a steady smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should be kept for details that no sharpening should be necessary. please note that no sharpening should always be subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">"straightener alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes equal in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you create a high value woven pattern. JPEG artefacts are best combined with a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. put this value therefore fitting to the degree of smoking in your picture."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is needed. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbullets, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: can be run as many times the algorithm. normally there is 1 or 2 out of the algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-sided side da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropen Alpha. if Alpha is small chosen, it should also be small to generate a long term. you should therefore choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to suit your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrated circuit page [0,1, 10]: integrated treasures in pixels. you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid Sub-pixels glomeration and never exceed 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the superior quality that you can receive by selecting this option is only small but the run time. we therefore recommend him to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons Save as and charging make exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and later be recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors are comparatively very fast at work. it can however still take a long time and take a high CPU load after yourself. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button-off.</seg>

<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filters are used per pixel and can equip the image via the radius and the color in it becomes exposed and thus lower errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the noise level. this value is laying down the pixel rate. if it is increased to adjust the channel filter. you may need to change the edges filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details do not get more and smokers or lubrication occurs again."</seg>

<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values, the threshold threshold, then the pixels being pursued further and checked for further classification. the maximum depth of the record can be set up with the lowering."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of smokers for the Strapping process, called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, changes & Povray; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to regular sample."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events occur in events that understands the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI-map showing all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet, and therefore always be a trumpet, if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a sound card, you do not need MIDI Map, because all sound maps GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS cards, FM radio devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. you must edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all required conversions for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP -section, which may appear as often as desired. prerequisite for this is, however, that each occurrence is a different textID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">"you see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for Options) and END, that the end of a paragraph is achieved."</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of general MIDI to your specific keyboard will be shown. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is believed that the GM -Patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also do not leave a line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"optional AllkeysTo M is needed to place all sounds, which will need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which is similar to a thread."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"now if a MIDI-file is to play a note with patch 127 (Win), it is Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI-file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch is meant that each tone is a different perversioninstrument (Drum, basins, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone is always the same drum means (like him possess some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify as notes on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as in the PATCHMAP -section the order of lines is very important, as their presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define for each channel and each instrument for several keyboards. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are needed above all to make tints on the bezel channel. check out as an example the included Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to switch some channels to others. if you want to change the first and second channel, you can easily make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered between 0 to 15, constructed according to the following patterns:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"N is the canal which is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap must be used further on this channel. if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events are ignored which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, then always patch will be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch can be useful for example to always use the perkets patch on the piston-channel channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio will be revealed in which ratio Pitch benchmarking events will be multiplied. if a MIDI file is transmuted with the value it is calculated with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used to stand in the map file (decimal number).</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM gives you that a keyboard, which is an Pitch Bender event will play with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, but try some keyboards up to a octave higher. unfortunately, try to find the right value on your keyboard, you must test a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the canal view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos, which sounds are just played."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the canal view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list, where you can choose an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1681">"the pace-LCD shows the speed, with which a song will be played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. if you find e.g. a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, speed, etc.. thus, the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can force anyone to use, & kmid; but a typical MIDI-file needs a similar sound quality. with a MIDI-file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this may happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; have happened because & kmid; no Awe need to compile the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid. 's homepage)"</seg>

<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines. log lines of level errors are shown with a striking colour than protocol lines of level notice. the colored display of protocol dialog can be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain process (e.g. in the system Protocol or in Cron-protocol), so you can observe the process identification (PID) in the column process. this may be useful for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case you use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can jump the option To new lines in the context menu of the main window, to display all of the new upcoming record lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open an additional sub-window, select a protocol to display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"& ksystemlog, has its own website at http: / / ksystem.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further information on the supply sources of & ksystemlog."</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion-Archivs: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; system V init Editor, known (and in the following as named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;"</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the System V init develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program in the highlands of the system in the & Linux, world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone can attempt to make a machine on System V init without a new installation and new format file. therefore you need to see that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service, which you want to start the system or change at another runlevel. system services do not contain such things such as setserial port, which only once started. such views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should also lie in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also specify a rc.serial port in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places according to the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look at the second column and probably find that the preset runlevel 3 is. if you want to change the previous Runlevel 3. if you want to change something, then you'll also fix something when you start the system and execute the following: "</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it now start all the right scripts? if you fill in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does and stops init actually system services? quite simply, each of the script is so written that it accepts a argument like start and stop. you can actually launch these scripts in the command line below:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the one K includes, the script is called to the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server Runlevel, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user-Runlevel, which starts & etc., network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"the use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointer is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of the available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop)."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move between Runleveling or change the position within a level by changing it or otherwise, the entry of its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the range of the available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you simply drag them into a new zone. to simply select copying from the menu or from the context menu and even then enter the target range, even if the same entry has already existed before the promotion area."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the number of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no possibility to restore entries, which have been thrown into the trash. be so careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable the different work areas (disposed system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to select a selection or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another Runlevel you move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it to the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a contract manually, press the button button to switch the Properties dialog box. close the dialog by clicking the button button to accept the changes, or press ic to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before it will be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. pre-settings become available to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc).</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveling and now starts the machine resistant new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in a single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have made some system services with & ksysv; for carrying out at Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way of system services started in these distributions are simplifies the configuration of the proprietorial combinations of these distributions, but does not correspond any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan a extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution: please check whether all the configuration files are present (and even if they are in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache and httpd) just end without message, when their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from Distribution to Distribution, can be used even from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this handbook can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser; start, it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you have to save them. either do not use the respective icon of the toolbar or the entry saving in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two boxes, the user and user's use list. for Editing, select the desired user or the desired group with a double clicking on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some carton cards are only represented if you have reactivated system settings. only when you have activated system settings, a card card will appear on which you can make individual settings. additional card cards appear, if Shadow -passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unixare installed."</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card-card password is published in case of shadow -passcodes or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD groups.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this card-card appears only if for at least a built-in file system is activated and initializes (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can be modified for each user, whereby the placements respectively in KB are:"</seg>
