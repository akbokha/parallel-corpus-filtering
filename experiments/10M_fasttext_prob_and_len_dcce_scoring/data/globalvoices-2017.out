&quot; although I had visited the US for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally large .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , played American music dancing , American authors and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly on account of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ dying , which was the top federal court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; me , &quot; it was , as if that is the absolute truth , do everything else that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you are always that you are , and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very black@@ ish love letter about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
a lot has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most exceptional aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his Eng@@ dies .
he never keeps his mind behind the mountain as you have so beautiful says .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of a former colleague , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ ro@@ us and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people have responded to his statements and voted in sc@@ ars for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won at the rep@@ ublic@@ ans elections , was the highest number one likely to nomin@@ ate one of the party nomin@@ ate candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ est person , I asked me ? &quot;
I could not bring Tru@@ mp and his voters to get into harmony with people during my time .
&quot; as for example my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist program , which people from all over the world is taking a deep a deep man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also Tru@@ mp@@ s universe is not associated with the by Peter Bh@@ atia , the current Editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix &quot; &quot; to watch the game . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son . &quot;
&quot; she also fits her to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped with a lot of patience and grace and helped me to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and those through them em@@ bo@@ died values of deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp extends its way to nomin@@ ate rep@@ ublic@@ s of presidential , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly consec@@ rate , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps straight on because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the examination of the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they had either his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , burst almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as re@@ assi@@ sts to describe .
&quot; to arrange the people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ ful , and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their churches are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which most of them are , for Tru@@ mp tun@@ ed , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country which she disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ cr@@ o , who comm@@ its the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who looks different with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different from it . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( m. ) . : as much as &quot; el@@ ong@@ ation of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ es &quot; ; word@@ play from white in touch on the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much does the great Van Jones N@@ amed , has just killed what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you might have always like , America is also welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country is elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ ian@@ ers , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but the choice of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again on the ruin , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan must , the father of a soldier who is fallen in Iraq , and what he said at the eve of the election . &quot;
at a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton had Mr. Khan had a word@@ search with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ or K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the amount answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; br@@ akes the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered her . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; could anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a un@@ anim@@ ous and sound @-@ strong &quot; NE@@ IN ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is that not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
that is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find any place in this new America . &quot;
and this breaks me my heart .

what is the Mexican Music school in the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
&quot; the music that played at both locations not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with waste
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a great gar@@ bage dump , just 16 kms south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among the tourists - but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) is now playing in the church : one from children and adults , a sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestr@@ as , which has found their musical instruments to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students is the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs &apos; abuse and the gangs @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot , which started a musical project and the youth lasted so a rare hop@@ eless@@ ness . &quot;
the young members take their commitments towards the music group very seriously and the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi :
&quot; once they come from the school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to med@@ itate their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come l@@ end and with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7.@@ 000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is virtually on top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made of reco@@ ver@@ able waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ prepared instruments , which consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez began to turn parts of the case in instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ate , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , har@@ ps , trumpets , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion which were all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and Musi@@ cians of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the initial time : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ sing and we had to teach in the same place where parents knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he has never seen before : a made of waste made violin .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from re@@ produced material and that is called The Recy@@ cl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical power to :
the world generates around one billion tons tr@@ ash each year .
&quot; those who live with him and live by him are the sle@@ eves - like the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that specifically reported about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release happens in the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already operated in liberal waters illegal fishing , before it was the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were thus far @-@ brought and little gen@@ dered to welcome a legislative bre@@ aker of this kind to their co@@ asts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que , and the Seych@@ elles is mobili@@ zed rapidly against the ship . they denied him to share one of their ports and consec@@ u@@ sted him to share a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply re@@ minded everything , Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leit@@ ner of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y Authority . he is part of a team who discovered the ship of the ship and followed it . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there .
&quot; ultimately it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , because of pill@@ age of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects crimin@@ ality practices , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Ill@@ egal Fishing ( Ill@@ egal fishing ) was founded . &quot;
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which then had driven the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is im@@ pris@@ oned , it is hidden because it is extremely difficult to up@@ lift it . this makes illegal fishing a main object of over@@ fishing from regions . &quot;
&quot; by the deliber@@ ate abuse of existing laws , through which certain habitats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can cause a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; however , while actions against illegal fishing was formerly hin@@ dered by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the sn@@ ail , with the information between individual countries , so that the actions nowadays happen in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; the individual countries can exchange with each other , e.g. lists of existing licenses , to susp@@ ected news or details that you noticed during a port in@@ spec@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when it move around the open sea , through satellite . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships which are fishing in ver@@ bot@@ an@@ ed areas - about such that indicate that a ship invites its ti@@ led fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ide@@ al@@ ment such surveys can show such investigations whether the participating ships have a fish stocks , where they were travelling and possibly also whether they have a pen@@ ing register . &quot;
&quot; countries which are against illegal fishing , can be found on the basis of this information then refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports . and that they might not be forced to sell their charge of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal fishing is not worthwhile itself . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leit@@ ner director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company which is involved in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported by F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed Front
&quot; the previously mentioned platform was created to recovered 20 million USD to lost sales , which lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing , present for commercial fishing from around the world . among these also those illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; to these practices include actions as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licens@@ ing , specification of fant@@ asi@@ en@@ ame , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature conservation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they are targeted the lack of international co @-@ operation and make the weaknesses of a not completely organised control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; it was able to say a ship illegal and a country could then say &quot; You dar@@ ing my port . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &apos; and precisely this leg@@ ale Schl@@ u@@ pf@@ lo@@ ch tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ ects ships .
&quot; it has un@@ covered criminal networks in Tanzania , the f@@ ake licenses used in Tanzania . it discovered ships that have several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has de@@ pl@@ ated ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the International Authority on the fight against crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us rather far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that is to help the F@@ ISH @-@ i to grasp di@@ gest ships precise .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s Satellite system , which is always developed further , also helps to hide illegal ships who like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Ch@@ ef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
some of the ships also switch off their automatic identification systems which can no longer be saved by satellites .
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps therefore to build a system , which connects different information levels with each other . it shall help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
recently Sky@@ Truth has recently opened its platform Global Fishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite channels and can be displayed with the position of every single ver@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of who , where does - this results simply meaning , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ le their resources for research . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , in which a global system allows tracking ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als , but also cr@@ ying . &quot;
ships that earlier without license conf@@ ection@@ ate and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences we know that they will be observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i has now participating a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats are more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had put Gre@@ ko 1 asc@@ ending , found the in@@ spec@@ tions there on board tow@@ ing , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; also other countries also notice this success . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a course object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa every year will disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 2015 six countries have joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest members of Somalia announce his first big tri@@ umph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the way under false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used tow@@ ing , which now is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also taken in ver@@ bot@@ ene waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set the a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea . Emma Bry@@ ce is free professional journals and lives in London . there they writes about environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . location in Venezuela is growing further to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of con@@ quer the country &quot;
the road moving in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they are considered to be protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum for the president of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat @-@ country Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des @-@ regions Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north of the Par@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country deter@@ ior@@ ates continuously improving what is noticeable in everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an ac@@ ute lack of food and medication .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; but finally , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election by the official authorities was blocked . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Mit@@ sui at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes in its latest article in the context of the Government Office as follows : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of social , political and economic crisis , which belong to the highest in all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which a grave and advanced lack of food and medicine , the referendum was to give the opportunity to reg@@ im@@ itate its institutional structures and to close a new governance . &quot;
&quot; the el@@ ectoral M@@ esa de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic unity ) , the demonstr@@ ators should be initiated later on the 27th of October , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government , which continues to continue the blo@@ cking of the refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms on November 3rd , should continue the blo@@ cking of the refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms towards Am@@ t@@ sen@@ ing . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :

&quot; Twitter can share pictures , which tell about disputes , as well as reports from oppression and failure . &quot;
particularly big waves struck the message over police oppression in the central north of Marac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral sure but the protests passed on .
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to keep the police forces , including these women in the An@@ des State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira have no tubes , because otherwise you could see something that many nation gar@@ di@@ sts did not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphics already makes a round that forms the scale of repression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship of the country has oppressed .
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a ministry procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many through the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s includes :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natur@@ es are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your imagination !
on the road !
&quot; other values consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has undertaken a little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and prefer to leave critical voices : &quot;
you have taken us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more on frequency and intensity .
&quot; some vene@@ ers reported the media , they may be hungry to participate in a strike , rather than to work or buy . &quot;

&quot; this is an adap@@ tive version of an interview made by Al@@ ejo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , the ur@@ in@@ c was published on 23 August 2016 on d@@ ía a d@@ ía , a Argent@@ inian translation . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an now adult man , Qu@@ ij@@ ano said now in the framework of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; it started to carry the same name as his father to the brut@@ al military per@@ im@@ ations at the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; 34 years , he held the family of the family of the family . &quot;
in the situation at that time I believed that was in order .
I felt like a sal@@ ary .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his Father . &quot;
&quot; I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , fol@@ dable and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , a time of state treas@@ ury , was his father from 1976 to 1978 Deputy com@@ mander of intelligence services in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano .
Archives .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who is due to ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the scale of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has a parent , and how this child chose a path of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I took me with a boy un@@ attended , the martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are a Ar@@ sch@@ lo@@ ch , you made you friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
pass on that they don &apos;t lead you to one day and then I must save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ tionary ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolu@@ tionary Volks@@ ar@@ me@@ e - the military arm of the Revolu@@ tionary Labour Party in Argentina . &quot;
&quot; therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would become obe@@ di@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought , that would be ok . for so my father was educated . &quot;
on the military base I had to forgive Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ an@@ da@@ material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da dr@@ ills the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
when first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he comm@@ anded me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just all possible - stood . &quot;
everything about it was st@@ olen .
&quot; he gave me a little into a ceiling wr@@ apped , and comm@@ anded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the st@@ olen objects were ab@@ sent and held me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I saw , and saw a goat , on the human being tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
&quot; later , I found out that they attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just cap@@ tiv@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; they rarely play a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , betra@@ yed him with water and hun@@ ted him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the stu@@ ank was dr@@ af@@ ted there ... such as a for@@ get@@ ary win@@ ch .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house p@@ rest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I was clearly that that is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; and I asked me , how is it possible that a man can do another so much sor@@ row ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me for the third time to work , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and were so@@ ckets . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mat@@ tresses on those naked people with the face down - all were cap@@ tiv@@ ated on hands and feet .
near the entrance bo@@ oth@@ ed people still in the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; when my father was not@@ ing that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ilt thou so , Ar@@ sch@@ lo@@ ch ? &quot;
&quot; I missed , Why hast thou associated myself ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and buried by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra were a few rooms , which were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero made a man coll@@ ap@@ sed and sl@@ ew .
&quot; according to information given by survi@@ ving the civil , Jorge Rom@@ ero which was indic@@ ted by the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process at the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ( death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emili@@ o F@@ essia , the leader of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former follow @-@ chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way to which you came here in , is also the way in which the kid@@ n@@ apped here came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , see that they took about this way and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names have been changed and they were given as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ised a number . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ fare &apos;
my father brought all sorts of st@@ olen things with home .
&quot; at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war , &quot; - as she called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later by the military , - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war , a bay@@ onet or maybe military sign , which one has fought one enemy that one has fought for . &quot;

&quot; but when one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... silent , then this is not war @-@ b@@ lowing but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always asked myself , as my Father , the leader of the security forces , with this V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it simply .
I was also an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I never would like to penet@@ rate into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
&quot; once , he called me a crime and I rep@@ lied , and thou that thou sti@@ ff the cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in front of anger , struck me and cri@@ ed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and move yourself . &quot;
we do not need any other !
that was my father .
I have not only a good memory of him .
&quot; when I said to the process , I showed a photo of that at that time , when I performed a jacket and a roll @-@ car swe@@ ater from w@@ ool . both my father had come from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time defended myself the defence , a co @-@ crime in this crime . I concei@@ ve , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to see .
&apos;@@ the Dis@@ appearances of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ om@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find Reu@@ e . &quot;
I have children . if one has only once children recogni@@ zes the value of a lifetime .
one develops further and det@@ ects that it is wrong to kill .
I was even so far to say :
&quot; well , you have gone over during the dictatorship people . but what does the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children do ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : you were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have just been able to put them into prison .
I appreciate it was simply chosen to kill these people . but why do their corp@@ ses disappear ?
&quot; did these people have not been handed over to families , whom one could pass their im@@ mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants ? &quot;
the wor@@ sen@@ ing of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ om@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me , when democracy was introduced back , hol@@ ged them to eliminate the im@@ mortality of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were destroyed and somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to put it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought , show my father came up during a conversation , when he was under house @-@ rest . &quot;
I made him pre@@ di@@ ment because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I do not know . I have killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked me , for the whole survi@@ ving patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; that they were alleg@@ edly defended , actually good . &quot;
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you say sow@@ as to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horri@@ ble crime and you have forced me as a child to participate .
he ref@@ uted just &quot; Na then de@@ g me . &quot;
exactly that did me .
2010 I re@@ funds the first ad .
I was finally recognized that he was a crime .
nobody can throw me that I have pres@@ um@@ ed . I finally said against my own father .

a transl@@ ating error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fright@@ ening drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation defect in a center in Kyoto where one can pro@@ long his leadership .
the photo has been circul@@ ated in social media .
processing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town Kyoto , customers have been a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his leadership in the last month a particularly ab@@ bl@@ iss@@ ful translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield the Japanese word ( cor@@ ei@@ vers sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means that &quot; older drivers &quot; means , perhaps - maybe even with mal@@ icious background &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; sc@@ ary drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was to read on electronic advertisements in the input area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine that has been shared in social media .
&quot; the error was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident Ky@@ otos , it was also that the local newspaper has made attention to it . &quot;
the Kyoto Newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , if gram@@ mar not quite correct term &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ fecture , Kyoto exc@@ used for the translation defect . furthermore , they declared that the error had already been included in the text they had been checked by the translator and that the translation was not tested on its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blog@@ gers reported as follows about the ap@@ ologies :
&quot; we are sorry that older men felt by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News was a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; sc@@ ary &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; fear@@ less &quot; was denied as in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but certainly cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , Kyoto for instance , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 from a total of 19.@@ 460 inci@@ dents caused by seniors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , the seniors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; with this , her share increased to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of the disease caused accidents have risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the named un@@ named re@@ por@@ ters held in Yahoo published version of the article &apos;s comments to the light , which indicate which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seemingly are against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors received among others the following comments :
- &quot; Is the ( &quot; sc@@ ary drivers &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; That is nothing , the translation is not at all , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I do not find that a real translator error is .
there are not quite a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gra@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Europe
transl@@ ating errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the website En@@ gra@@ ish@@ .com is a true look @-@ in for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; for passing , one needs two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the starting @-@ text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in case of native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother tongue . &quot;
such a French mother language should translate into French for example from English into French - not from French into English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese businesses do not employ workers with English as a native language , translation into English . this may be due to fault of understanding , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers , to learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies who do not have any foreign employees , cause translations of company internally . then the Japanese employee who made English knowledge as the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ ally and mysterious propositions which arise by machine translation , reveal that this technique may not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to several languages especially . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English formulations in Japan , including the mysterious us@@ sel@@ fish prints , which often uses T @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood not at all . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless or at least harmless . but from large companies or by the government , which have the means to ensure greater standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
Kyoto Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and quot@@ ations on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Fri@@ day@@ morning , April 7th , mel@@ ted ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an internet users that they could not have access to the online station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV is also no longer available . &quot;
&quot; other online radio stations were also organised by protests in Car@@ acas , which were organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , which res@@ ist the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the end of the parliament was dis@@ solved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties on the executive . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link was coupled with , and recommended to the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an provider will be locked once again .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been depres@@ sed since 2014 during the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission will continue to report on these demonstrations , when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a call for violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I logged in to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ res Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay by a blo@@ cking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two other online radio stations . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly carries its sessions . &quot;
&quot; earlier post@@ ures of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had result in order to use the local internet provider to take DNS users . this is a technique caused by the DNS server requests given by certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server is incorrect or denied the enquiry when calling for such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS @-@ sper@@ re : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission of the Thursday , 6th April , is set as the V@@ PI@@ TV Camer@@ am@@ ann El@@ vis Flor@@ es , which was taken live in cu@@ sto@@ dy by the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was at the police force .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went over again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus the vene@@ ers of access to m@@ ultim@@ edi@@ atric reporting on current events in the country continues to grow further . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slave to sustain a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina it is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo of Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of curiosity .
&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report from Kur@@ tural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que &quot; &quot; ( &quot; F@@ unds cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) that is processed by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , in which they did not work together with the family who was allowed to eat there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her degree at the university she returned to the house again and heard , as the owner of the house was full of pride about them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; which has become something has become , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when they became ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , in Paraguay , the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money gives her min@@ der@@ year old son or her mother &apos;s daughter to another , abundant family . in the exchange gets the child food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned above , is that children can afford to do countless days of household work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a contract you cannot lift . &quot;
this considered Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go practice in Paraguay is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for several years for an organization responsible for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - sam@@ pled , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; they tried to call things when name to name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated with the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guarantees in general bre@@ ast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family that her daughter is in faith that they ex@@ clude so their training to improve their position in society and make something out of itself , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that takes the girl in itself and whose exploitation is justified by faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise no training would be received , and perhaps even star@@ ve . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ sed , his family will experience only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon occurred in January 2016 which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in the hospital , her body showed traces of violent stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former Mil@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official in the population .
&quot; Mar@@ ín was living in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small place with just 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck with a stick on Mar@@ ín until it was deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last session in the life of young girls .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the ear@@ ed child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go for the death of the girl .
they marked cri@@ m@@ ada@@ m@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there will be no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay is more cows than children registered , &quot; def@@ endant Tina Al@@ var@@ enga &quot;
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which circumstances boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a growing study of the fall .
&quot; they want the Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , which was to be sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be rep@@ ent@@ ance - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go before the court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; crimin@@ als are not only exploited as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the Far@@ mer , where their father had to register , and their father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; your brothers had to work all , and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets to earn money . &quot;
but they all went further to the school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood up for 5 pm and prepared breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example puri@@ fying them the refrigerator , p@@ aci@@ te the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went back home and had time to learn .
&quot; the more they had finished , the more leisure time it had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says , she had never been hungry , but did not get un@@ bo@@ unded . &quot; I was allowed to pick more books from the library of the landlord as eating out of the fridge . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belon@@ ged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was part of the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , which was part of the opposition from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some sections of the house@@ ke@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ enga , next to him stand and editorial from Op@@ position@@ ists like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to per@@ su@@ ade them to convince the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but did not stand with her . &quot; the house@@ ke@@ r had found someone who had heard about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; bad habit . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ enga , which would be talking to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í back home their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord fear@@ ed that they had the education they had made it , again , explains her . &quot;
&quot; it was entirely clear that she got for everything she got out of them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school Al@@ var@@ enga was discri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; a thing that is almost never spoken , Mob@@ bing and the Sch@@ ik@@ ans who are exposed to the school . &quot;

hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .

please see you .
&quot; beginning from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a wonderful girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by came , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ story . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote her . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , which would like to work . &quot;
then switching the editor in the ad once again a :
&quot; dear friends , I have found a thing . I look if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thanks , I write again , if something is . &quot;

bill introduced to the government of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
six@@ ty Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently agreed to a bill for the Reg@@ ul@@ atory according to the use of social networks and social networks .
&quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , we must register social media and social media in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established , which is associated with it to give citizens a permit to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , pay@@ ers and users would have to register on the site of the place with their right names and recru@@ iting numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it be dre@@ amed of this , so that could bring a punishment of up to six months in cu@@ sto@@ dy or an ATM . &quot;
&quot; the bill introduced which consists of six par@@ agr@@ es and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as a &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is run through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice , video @-@ mail and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is performed if it is accepted , as the draft is no indication of how the Egyptian authorities can res@@ ign the pay@@ ers and users the registration is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians of Parliament and promot@@ er of the Legisl@@ ative Decree , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user name and password from the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations Department , and a password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning a fire@@ wall at the national level around Facebook . due to which , it would be necessary for Egypt and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
yet it has not been known that such plans are there .
experts from the site are sc@@ ep@@ tical in respect to the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research T@@ echnolog@@ ist ( in German &quot; leit@@ ner research &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I doubt strong in technical capacities and understanding any authority in Egypt regarding things , which have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion they make it clear that just as they for@@ ci@@ ze physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , then that means they will set up a strong surveillance system to either request a permit or not . and this means a contro@@ vers@@ ed system to monitor the activities of the people and to bring it to a court process . &quot;
&quot; this is technically , realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Legisl@@ ative Parliament and the Constitu@@ tional committees , before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement is being successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and assured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present at the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliament@@ arians of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a legislative procedure against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ term prison for those who were inv@@ ented to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; &quot; protest against protest . &quot; &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of the Ir@@ aks working at H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the spirit@@ ually Persian Leopard .
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which belong to Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leopard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are found due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they are always less pre@@ y . &quot;
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only survi@@ ving rust@@ y in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and the memorial of the ecos@@ ystem also depends that a large pre@@ dat@@ at@@ tier is present . &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leopard actually in the free wild way is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video is therefore imper@@ ative that they have a shot of a big cat in the Camer@@ oon , the R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;
as a trained bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passi@@ on@@ ately like another side of their country which is not only composed of war and conflict .

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , which were documented for the Nor@@ the@@ ast Japan K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , advances made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of &quot; three @-@ fold disaster &quot; from March 2011 . a vast earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a fine pre@@ fecture in Japan , that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the Neigh@@ bours of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate have been imp@@ lied because the ts@@ un@@ ami had to disappear all the coastal cities of the map .
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had a nuclear accident , even alone it had to leave 160 000 inhabitants left their homes . &quot;
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows that progress six years after that progress has been reached in order to rebuild the life of local resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ forming authority and survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; housing in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( for example , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was able to record Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts have been completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with 70 percent of the final light forms . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one still stri@@ ves , even six years after the disaster , evac@@ u@@ ated by Beh@@ avi@@ ra ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
after the triple disaster almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ving accommodation .
&quot; in December 2016 , still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate in such short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 per cent of the year 2011 evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a still live more than 75 per cent of the evac@@ u@@ ated , which became more than 75 per cent of the evac@@ u@@ ated accommodation , were converted into final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ata the number is at 34 percent .
the state of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; how the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Zeitung was able to establish 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by un@@ happiness until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of schools of three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
&quot; during almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i now back in operation , we have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a just 30 percent of the fisher@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved to the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land @-@ scale cultivation in Mit@@ passi@@ on@@ . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ag@@ re land in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a again . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic incident , as only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed A@@ cker@@ mann of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , are located in the &quot; nu@@ cl@@ ear@@ ing system zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a far down@@ cast . &quot;
the tourist payments in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 percent in the same stand as before un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a on the other hand can only be 75 per cent .
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reported that since the disaster has almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it seems more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; to determine a general picture , the paper led numerous surveys under the native population and under the evac@@ u@@ ated by . they asked them about the state of re @-@ construction and also how their sensation has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population in experience .
&quot; the survey brought it that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the resident resident , have taken to be taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents , however , are still not done enough in disasters prevention . &quot;
as it comes to those who had to evac@@ u@@ ate from the Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a
in her edition to the anniversary of the straw@@ berry the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the position of the evac@@ u@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a did not only have to experience the huge earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , atomic facts , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , almost 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , there were more than 23 000 people , returned to Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , in lasting spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a outside their home @-@ pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evac@@ u@@ ated regions are most of the evac@@ u@@ ated presses , older than 50 years old . they need to compete in correct construction projects , because the efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with massive construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games to take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if one meet people from other countries that speak another language the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
&quot; after a while , one often det@@ ects that a more link than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , since they are demanding our prejudi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world finally is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat themes which often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who are remember@@ ing a moment in which they felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders . &quot;

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva at a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 has been delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday had taken him a polic@@ eman during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide participated millions of demonstr@@ ators in a Protest@@ ant against as@@ parag@@ us .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva Tarok the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several Fr@@ ak@@ tures .
&quot; doctors operated him this Saturday , and now they have moved it into an artificial Kom@@ a . &quot;
its condition is considered critical .
the local photo of Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that spread rapidly within a few days .
on the pictures also the face of the police attack is identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police force in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás , that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until completion of the investigation of the incident from the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police posts like he in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira proposes ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police show was checked by a prot@@ esters and end on the intensive care station , his face would see six months long on television and the whole oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook @-@ page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activi@@ sts from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Luz , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police posts and several rac@@ ite shortly afterwards to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective it has appeared also in social networks . &quot;
in the shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus as from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , this has lived in another state of State ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while staying in the hospital . &quot;

police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to the brut@@ al police on demonstr@@ ators in the last Friday .
&quot; polic@@ emen sat in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber @-@ fin and iner@@ tia . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speaker , to ren@@ oun@@ ce violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ ested by putting the focus on another , un@@ expected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc . &quot;
&quot; the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a cerem@@ onial glass window , in order to ex@@ clude its front pages illustr@@ ative . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the O Glo@@ bo preferred a title story with a set @-@ up bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window than about the protests of thousands of people who serve to defend the defence of a special thing . &quot;
this must also recognise if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; also here , the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; gets an absurd importance , and the typical non @-@ violence of military police are determined by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ator &quot; &quot; with the police &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters &quot; &quot; with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the villages of the Ent@@ re@@ alization For@@ gotten forgotten villages in Cuba
the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso joined almost hundreds of sugar can@@ dies in Cuba for doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the Greg@@ ory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ ar , located in the Western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ abe@@ que is known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there is no n@@ enn@@ able sugar @-@ harv@@ ested spot . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugars factories .
&quot; after the yield of the sugar pi@@ ping industry in the region , and the factory abandoned after and after its plants , until only the ru@@ mp are left out of steel and concrete . &quot;
about 272 workers had to find themselves new .
some are rarely the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ ties and comm@@ ute daily to factories , which are still ma@@ hlen . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which stands every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the Sug@@ ar industry does not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar @-@ fabri@@ ken , who have been in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were received . &quot;
that was something he was not expecting .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds us of having heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ as I would receive the Sug@@ ar Factory , but the promise has not been held . &quot;
&quot; the Sug@@ ar Construction Industry has already been working in the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administrative decision and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production of 1,@@ 6 million tonnes of sugar was produced less than the 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a mot@@ ive for several decades ago , but the bad har@@ vesting are already no longer . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugars ?
the old railway parts of the church had already seen better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar pi@@ pe@@ ers was an economic need : the 155 of sugar @-@ fabri@@ ken were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive , they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to focus on the production on the most efficient factories that was annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the motives , which resulted in such measures were the low productivity of the sugar can@@ e plant@@ ations and the rise crisis on the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per l@@ b , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Land@@ struc@@ tor &quot; from the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Nutrition organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; when the current production of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the commodity export is roughly 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will come into history with certainty into history , that were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the stagn@@ ation of 98 sweets fabri@@ ken came to more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the Sug@@ arbe@@ et Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , is the word that he is repeated in most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them has been informed that the factory would be mis@@ placed .
&quot; to order that the place will receive , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first kick @-@ year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recognised documents that would only be removed from the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could share any removal . &quot;
from there the responsibility was handed over and the letters have always been more common .
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the still@@ ed factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the remaining sugar can@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was opposed to his will at the stagn@@ ation of the factory , where he helped him . &quot;
&quot; with each part , which he removed , disman@@ tled one of his 31 labour @-@ years . &quot;
the developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important work@@ stations has been er@@ ased .
&quot; in many cases there were no alternatives for working practices and services that the systems in the communities were gener@@ alized , in which they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the first President looked into the eyes of the people , when he guaranteed that for five years , their factories have been in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of the sugars
since 2004 Sug@@ ar is only extrac@@ ted high through m@@ illing .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the popular Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich means that many things are changing , but not always for the better if a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the Sug@@ ar factory was closed , or better said when they began to gra@@ zing them , they also heard on the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories . &quot;
they have been made to spare parts .
without future spec@@ tions even a lot of young people left the region .
&quot; in the area a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility are still impos@@ ing .
&quot; in the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty harv@@ ests bring to the old soldiers a rise of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ as .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a tragic person , yet he gives him the lies , which one told him , not . &quot;

first Nations young people use Hip Hop to express themselves and obtain their own culture

&quot; youth of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with themes which are important for them . they do so by means of Hip Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos; we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centers , to promote youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
the original workshops were led by the pe@@ dago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and then worked in Nord @-@ Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree @-@ Communities and then with the C@@ ree Hip Hop group The North@@ stars together .
&quot; the workshop is increasing that the young participants in talks such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ unacceptable &quot; or what they can always come into mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of W@@ inn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. federal state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia relates for example the history of highway 16 , also &quot; highway of t@@ ears , &quot; at which almost two dozen of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ resolved .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First nation uses the mot@@ ive of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people of the First Nations are not always broken . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ i C@@ ree First nation is recorded , the ref@@ rain on C@@ ree is sung . &quot;
the young people took some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip Hop group that gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the fac@@ ebook page from N &apos; we Jin@@ an is available the St@@ rop@@ he into in@@ scription , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if no one would ever be interested in myself
but I try to go on earth for my days
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we have lost our way to life as a youth
but I believe that we will be able to raise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this way they can grow and lead by our youth
so they can do that where they determined the Creator
&quot; in the commentary , the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also added a post and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ ben@@ au ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic meals ( free of charge ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see in front of almost every restaurant @-@ plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are shown close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin gentle pur@@ u ( free of charge of the food &quot; ) of each Spe@@ ise , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see this plastic menu and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go ahead .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic meals .
&quot; in Tokyo , there is a variety of these small businesses that produce just those plastic dishes made by the German fil@@ mm@@ akers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese them are these plastic dishes so usually , they don &apos;t even refresh them any more . a new trend turns it today in con@@ spic@@ uous mobile phones and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome released the blog@@ gers it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin San@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic @-@ appointed mobile phone rings , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Office . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were changed to kit@@ schi@@ gen contrac@@ ting , as in this case , cool@@ ness mag@@ net : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ cking cooler for a new exhibition in Tokyo station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ ti@@ fications becomes increasingly p@@ liable .
in this case a ka@@ isen group was transformed ( a popular traveling bowl with seafood ) into a mobile phone rings .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
also this part we have made for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is a apple that sends your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to watch like an apple , with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing excursion into the comfort .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phone @-@ designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon is used , a popular T@@ opp@@ ings which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can prov@@ oke my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
&quot; I think , I will probably be the only one . &quot;
this interest in plastici@@ zers can also take a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members uncomfortable .
our new mobile phone @-@ stands has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ ons from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plasma @-@ dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the has@@ ht@@ ag # show , or not of a free of charge . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood Capp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the lighting of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin San@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese bags are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against the drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports in@@ - and foreign media over the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the missing and gear@@ boxes regularly emerge only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy against this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the Chief of Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , the stories of the victims of the conflict is totally in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , there is hardly anyone looking at the trau@@ ma or to the congreg@@ ations that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every corp@@ se , behind every bone mar@@ bles in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of loose parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose w@@ oun@@ ds perhaps never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico holds the digital project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ end@@ a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug dealers &apos; ) , which aims to give such sacrific@@ es and stories of people who spoke in the struggle between prosec@@ ution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime makes us not just fear of our lives .
the effects are far profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug retailers and all congreg@@ ations are therefore many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que c@@ ambi@@ an p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; like fear life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who over@@ looks the me@@ ek tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost their father to just one day her father , their four si@@ bl@@ ings , their husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing ourselves back to the task today that we have placed us , go to gra@@ ves , and to gra@@ ves , according to the people who we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13th October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , for I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but who does not get paid them out , because they require a dying certificate . &quot;
where should we get the cause ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid of that . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the government . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in Hoch@@ ris@@ iko areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a les@@ bian of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central mex@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
disease and sensation @-@ journ@@ alism I have been known for several years now .
&quot; I come down every day by time of time , and see the front pages with images , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for criminal attor@@ neys , or from ch@@ anting specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel the feeling , as if I am the one that is cont@@ ented or sad . it works , like a lack of respect towards the person who was once belon@@ ged to this body . &quot;
I can not be equal or consider it as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year old c@@ ous@@ in thinks that he wants to be Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the pen@@ ises when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is , as if they were those who have lost someone , and those who have fear that they have something happened to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories to mere figures become in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ action of humans is unbeliev@@ ably for me , if the death of six people and the cour@@ aging of 43 students are justified in a neighbour , that they were &quot; cher@@ ished . &quot;
I think they are trying to talk that they remain unaffected by such trag@@ e@@ dies if they are not stir@@ red up and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico @-@ town has written the post &quot; Four months black@@ mailing in the main square : how a family moved with threats . in it , she describes how armed crimin@@ als month for the month money from their business , until they had not only destroyed the business but also their families apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed , the better . &quot;
you are in the words with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will guide you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would trigger my deep@@ est feelings , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ pt . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the post &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence initiated .
&quot; in the introduction he raises questions on how : who is taking care of the child of a missing woman and a man , who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most vulnerable city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them .
&quot; br@@ yan is a washing and he tells that he had to teach herself , how to bo@@ asting a egg cook@@ s , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which live with him . this is his name for preparing the vial with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are un@@ important in comparison to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
&quot; but this was not the day , where his childhood ended . &quot;
&quot; his childhood has been over two years ago when he was just a few blocks from his home , the blo@@ ody corp@@ se of his father saw , who had been shot by armed men from a pre @-@ driven car . &quot;
&quot; born as br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez : &quot;
br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against it with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most vulnerable city in the world due to the number of members of citizenship for public security and government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ ut@@ or @-@ office 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the section 8,@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that can be depos@@ ited in Mexico in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
but few stories live in view of ever new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those who we cannot forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co , whose aim is to put the complex information behind the failed fight against drug dealers , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in an understandable way . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand in@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he linked , contain images , on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift up a straight or fal@@ seh@@ ood .
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time has occurred ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tend to be further . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR@@ C ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it was mis@@ leading to use trag@@ e@@ dies , trag@@ e@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false cl@@ ut@@ ch of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dr@@ aft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank @-@ cars per@@ for@@ ated the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , gra@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . thereby 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after civil war , Africa has been negl@@ ected for years of years and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region were become dangerous path@@ ians , which were difficult to ride . &quot;
&quot; typically , the tank @-@ carriage fell to the victim . &quot;
&quot; authorities described a fire@@ ball , the frag@@ rant houses ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ de including a cin@@ em@@ as near , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the football world championship . &quot;
houses se@@ ated and shortened corp@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the im@@ mortality .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 . January 2015 Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example for this .
it shows rows of en@@ li@@ ly body that are mounted on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been revealed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , though real but not related in connection with trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the fighters of the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am the dischar@@ ges Nig@@ er@@ ian villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
&quot; eye @-@ witnesses reported dr@@ as@@ tically from atro@@ cities , in front of which they had to fle@@ e . &quot;
houses and shops were burned down and sur@@ names used in streets and bus@@ hes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the numbers could not be confirmed , but no one remained back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; said a resident on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were destroyed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite channels , the following time could be portr@@ ayed . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack also remained un@@ clear , but the armies stand in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the trial of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , land to win ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture comes from the DR of Congo , as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack has been presented : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ ac@@ re at 2.000 people took place two days in Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo has only documented in a series of mis@@ align@@ ments ; Africa Check has documented tribut@@ aries on Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was taken as a cover for mass@@ ages .
yet a step further will bring personal comments such as this example mis@@ ses the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the picture from the bar also joined in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a light@@ ning law , published by the United Nations , those who fled from r@@ ape , r@@ ape and et@@ ish t@@ ote , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s , such as the following , which brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from a sau@@ di @-@ Arab post @-@ side , which took place in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Being has said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she also used the image from the DR Congo to provide this information . &quot;
&quot; the original fee , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source , were also mis@@ diagnosed Th@@ ein Being this statement , but had not associated with the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide reach fal@@ si@@ ery information
traces of this false purchases of coupling dates back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; converted picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed borders . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images found that the poss@@ essed picture from the DR Congo are very similar .
&quot; they come from a mixing mas@@ ch private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have been re@@ directed incorrect reports and others have tried to un@@ fold the f@@ eit@@ ing .
&quot; we have collected examples for the ab@@ usive use and brought them into contact with the respective countries , on which page they were published . thus , we want the reach more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also associated with each other ) may have several examples of ab@@ usive usage .
some cases that can now be fully supported ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
&quot; countries from the incorrect copying of the image from the DR Congo , with Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
the or@@ ted countries point out on pages or server over the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ oods are still available .
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ y are examples , which are according to the metad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ tin , probably also for@@ age examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( directed to Alger@@ ian and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; in this post , a blog@@ gers from Que@@ bec City not only discussed the mis@@ conception , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions according to the intentions of the persons and the trag@@ eous trag@@ e@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

the picture was captured as a cover for the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with it were inter@@ ven@@ ed in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the goal was to judge attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Indonesian ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message , which suppos@@ edly has been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; over the Nig@@ er@@ ian mass@@ ac@@ re , translated it discussion , like this here on Vietnamese and explained it to fal@@ seh@@ oods . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image was included in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other Ac@@ counts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in Grau ) shows Tin@@ Eye also , but are no longer completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data presentations with URLs and time stamps exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and ob@@ serves them about image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , the picture appeared clearly after the original un@@ gl@@ omer@@ ation of 2010 , the image is ultimately possibly a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames with frames . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in regards to bigger discussions on the silence in connection with the investigation of Christians by Muslims and - for the defence of Muslims - the ass@@ or@@ ations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is assessed compared to a European or French life .
religion want to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images in connection with these efforts are used .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe this pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media there are fifty people , the un@@ int@@ enti@@ onal share of this share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ge@@ es that mood of incorrect and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and narrower it the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread @-@ wide images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the ref@@ unding of images of a woman is equivalent to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures readers and spect@@ ators are des@@ ensi@@ tizing and give them the ability to emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which sear@@ ched , such as violent media to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss expres@@ sions in the news media , it is fact that they are essential for today &apos;s news re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; T@@ echn@@ ologist experim@@ entation , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will soon have to think about situation in which a picture may be sug@@ gest@@ ed , which actually may also be dis@@ solved by the context or on totally ab@@ usive way . &quot;
&quot; however , every investigation of fal@@ si@@ bilities should also take into consideration how international they can . &quot;

a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( e.g. D@@ t. is uns@@ ur@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not able to translate them at all .
such words are available in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ able words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese su@@ da@@ de ) and others who are rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ br@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all resist@@ ors are stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly each attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; one word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a certain context is required to understand precisely what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example words in the blog contains words from the VAT , language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &apos; - Bem@@ bo you to receive your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &apos; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after one has grown on cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they dis@@ wear other cultures , reve@@ aling other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our novel@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence on how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site even more of this &quot; &quot; uns@@ ur@@ able &quot; words &quot; and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ transl@@ ates are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka goes with the worst floo@@ ds of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is at the moment of the worst flood @-@ water disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ sun , which normally sets in late May , are through strong ra@@ inf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country across the shore . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the disaster of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mu@@ st@@ rolling . &quot;
over 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 3@@ 04 safe locations .
&quot; the ra@@ inf@@ alls were left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygienic dis@@ proportion of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the scale of the flo@@ od@@ ine disaster :
floo@@ ds in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water conditions of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood @-@ water .

&quot; the Air Force has five planes for lif@@ ebo@@ ats , and further five are made available for transport of staves for the residents made in their floo@@ ded villages . &quot;
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have also explained to help .
Facebook @-@ Pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tim@@ s in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .

&quot; likewise , they led a &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; button which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful Bo@@ at@@ ement actions for a result of floo@@ ds and terrestrial human beings . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kas , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bringing residents in need for security and help help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human life , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restoring the norm@@ ality . &quot;

use Author@@ ized .D@@ am@@ als in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust her four year old daughter , they familiar to me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the one minute we call par@@ ishes for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ andi@@ zing we are rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of rain@@ bow and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head tow@@ el high , tied from a American flag , other sk@@ andi@@ zing par@@ olen against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look at me and says , &quot; These things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; , &quot; I ask myself . &quot;
I already have guided this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the vast concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built themselves in their conception . &quot;
they ent@@ ails me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide . &quot;
we do not see all the same .
we practic@@ ing our religion differently .
we identify with that Muslim to be Muslim to different species But somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is in our collective idea so well constructed that as soon as Muslims , which are as I can not fit there , mus@@ li@@ fied there . &quot;
to be dec@@ ad@@ mis@@ ed
I was not alone with it alone .
that is even done to the po@@ et whose poetry in America is bor@@ dered : Rum@@ i .
which images come to a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ ine Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox pre@@ acher pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western vision , the religion Rum@@ is er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this deletion makes a great part of the history of the 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims from this world . &quot;
another consists in the reduced pictures of Muslims , the Western books already col@@ oni@@ ze for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid took the story behind these images in the 19@@ 70s .
but these pictures are still further forward today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues to continue . &quot;
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty nar@@ r@@ ative ab@@ domin@@ ate our new@@ s@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality , which in the last three decades have nine Muslim women have led their lands , while the USA 2016 did not even choose their first female presidential race . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to acknowledge that if French , mus@@ cular women are prevented from their head to wear their head tow@@ el in public buildings and to cover sau@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover the entire body that these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exer@@ ts its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change will lead . &quot;
&quot; it also sees that the first Muslim Pra@@ yer on American soil has been spoken of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which were brought with slave Shi@@ ps . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Fo@@ rati@@ v has engaged our collective imagination , so deeply and fails , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become the aim of anti @-@ violent attacks and sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
approximately 1.@@ 7 billion are part of
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories to tell that based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry is s@@ ore to grasp the sc@@ rati@@ os of the 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims have the highest degree of &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the whole Muslim population are African @-@ female Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my rede@@ emed parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ ati@@ sts from Bangladesh with the name of Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan thought the sky@@ lines of the world was re @-@ thought , my parents were un@@ w@@ oun@@ ds Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ w@@ oun@@ ce Muslims and Americ@@ an@@ erin ?
&quot; sometimes , if people ask why I do not say a pig , I say - instead of my mus@@ cular Recipes , or my hand@@ some T@@ ash@@ an , which all Muslims bear in himself - &quot; from respect to P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I sh@@ ear , we do not carry all the T@@ ash@@ or@@ ane with us . &quot;
&quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security ch@@ equ@@ es at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding mus@@ cular schol@@ ars , mus@@ cular activi@@ sts and inter@@ religious activi@@ sts who strive to fight far widespread lies on Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced at the current volume of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ ism machine with funds , th@@ ink @-@ tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of an pres@@ by@@ tery church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social sciences &apos;s religious life describe , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ly faith and behaviour is maybe not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbour in the Brand@@ ung see that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 feet of concrete and air that separate houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the all@@ u@@ ity ritual with my daughter when I defe@@ ated them in my arms , and her the Arab verses to protect against protecting the Koran , and the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I therefore ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and evil that you cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother m@@ ater@@ er with their sisters ; as it took over decades a competition of the art of flower in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their fully end@@ ent and un@@ finished paintings , a book with hundreds of book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and twenty @-@ four chapters that they can virtually exc@@ eed@@ ingly . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims , the prayers to speak they had said to speak , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims , as they brought me to God , to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God signi@@ fy , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over centuries - by a &quot; empire , &quot; which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Is@@ ini@@ dies @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my zu@@ ander@@ ed grandfather we@@ pt . &quot;
&quot; Split@@ s@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and writes about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , we@@ pt N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ um@@ w@@ oun@@ ds to his family in the whole of India was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know is that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians present their families , as with my grandfather , by colon@@ ists , who have shared the Muslim world like at the play risk . &quot;
&quot; Muslims have to be knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans all have lived up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that the first fly bom@@ b of history was rejected a century on a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , a Swedish , cold under@@ tan of the British empire , was designated from the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that four years ago the most powerful army of the world , with troops , spread across each continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica , spread to the mass destruction of mass destruction , which not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million id@@ ols are buried beneath the tru@@ sts of war .
an American Muslims means to know that the self @-@ suff@@ iciency has risen since 2001 by over 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy comes home secre@@ tly , and the susp@@ ects a Muslim names , the story of four times will be reported more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name of Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ist por@@ ter called Bil@@ ali Muhammad , and brought into this land . &quot;
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people have crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and if we are saying black life .
&quot; to be a Americ@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , which fail to fail to pass them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Fo@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion bir@@ ths more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother to provide me with my child , and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful , and privileged persons on this branch of structural Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ ism consists of the Muslim registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immigration officer , which takes a five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from straight out of the countries that bom@@ bed the bom@@ bed .
&quot; it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ list , &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims into the visor . &quot;
&quot; there are wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs , which we shed on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and to which we are not telling , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists showed a scienti@@ fically proven image and b@@ ates them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the s@@ light@@ est score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; we are too deep in mind , the Muslim or the &quot; other &quot; to enth@@ r@@ ise . &quot;
we come back in decades to recognise the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and hazardous expression of expression that we re@@ port@@ ability in our news editors .
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which is trying to detect our often with blade identi@@ ties and forget history . &quot;

&quot; but I am concerned , due to this difficult global time , in which we are located . &quot;
&quot; and that moment has consequences , which go beyond the 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
&quot; there is a reason for that conspir@@ acy theore@@ ti@@ cians that existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
&quot; they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially , because Muslims have made &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by opening the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a few years ago it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history that I was not aware of , when I was as old as I was my daughter now , but who made me now a w@@ um@@ ented Muslims . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ cru@@ m@@ sp@@ ur in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ se@@ ers that makes our humanity like a story , where someone turns to a &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , you will take place in the context of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; Other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are not the terms , with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why tell me this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where however Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people through the fo@@ oth@@ ills of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public conception , four decades of the Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions about the role of what is aware and un@@ aware of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; as it did my girlfriend and I in rain during the Women &apos;s March , because he is having no president who is already broken countries and &quot; to others &quot; people bom@@ bed &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
it begins with all of us .
initiative for Er@@ nar@@ r@@ kunst wants to preserve urban diversity
&quot; tastes , from Flick@@ r @-@ Users Daniele Ros@@ si , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to enter here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the creation of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported above briefly about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the im@@ re@@ plac@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written report , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite such small languages will not be passed on to the children . &quot;
for the creators of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we can create cities , the diversity - safe spaces , in which inhabitants do not have to mention who they are to be related . &quot;
&quot; often listening to this is often associated to understand &quot; &quot; How these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to estimate , to feel , &quot;
in this format the story told their story in their own language before and translate them into English .
&quot; even if the participants are not professional tastes , their devotion and their representation is that the audi@@ ences are on it . &quot;
they call lau@@ gh and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the Gift of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of nar@@ r@@ alled art . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the fork of the bun@@ nies and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; after having been declared the meaning of his beak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara will be asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience , which does not share your language ? &quot; with a broad ridge , he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have heard !

Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ composition of the state debt
&quot; with the aim of a re@@ consideration of public debt by Puerto Rico , which rose to 72 million US dollars , the march took place on the International April 2017 , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was called by the group of Ci@@ u@@ da@@ dano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da ( Citiz@@ ens for the neur@@ examination of debts ) and the Eastern Assembly of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the new debt also submitted an petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls for the politicians , ben@@ ches and government authorities , who are responsible for debts for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial review and a governance committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ res@@ sed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos is den@@ tified to pay a debt that is not its .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state @-@ of @-@ integrated territory of the USA - is suffering from severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a ruling non @-@ profit organization without party membership with focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law of government responsibility , as an alternative to the existing government . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a broad restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; the measures imposed from the outside , without the participation and conviction of the citizens are to be passed away from the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

artists and writers appreciate the work of the missing Syria Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi
Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi and his wife N@@ oura .

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ development Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remember@@ ing the contributions that he has made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture that is organised in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , chair@@ men from the book C@@ ost of Freedom , A Coll@@ ective enquiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective re@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book that was published last year and is available in license @-@ free , contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tri@@ bute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
&quot; this book would be discussed how movements can be built for free knowledge , and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activi@@ sts , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who have been involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to see over the fo@@ g who gives our new@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celeb@@ rating Internet volunteers that has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison quarters , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or location . &quot;
the introductory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective memory gives his friends and his family a voice who want to push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own fate , acts and decisions . &quot;
why are we today here ?
what did we have chosen ?
what do we have given up extreme beliefs in this process ?
the Web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the j@@ ail Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , told that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported it was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as an in@@ sider government , and made aware of an in@@ stig@@ ated death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; his place of stay and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons involved in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to expand access to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , T@@ echn@@ ologist and currently crossing the Head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of the basic cultural prototypes were predic@@ tive as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as virtual . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the elimination of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture , with hi@@ esi@@ ans traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el then could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS was put to put everything in it , which is not only em@@ bo@@ died by the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world em@@ bo@@ died . &quot;
&quot; this strip is created in digital archae@@ ology and the preservation has created a time @-@ chapel , which will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable importance . &quot;
&quot; typically , Bass@@ el this project has not been completed yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life with this , of freedom to dream and bass taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English even when he was in cu@@ sto@@ dy .
I lear@@ nt to read and speak English well .
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each , who asked him . he has taught others in@@ spec@@ ulated , English to read and speak . &quot;
Bass@@ el has opened me the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also contributed to other instances , as they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually holding them in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ filing , which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 her husband , when he was in cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for a year .
she tasted the lyrics to him when she visited him and he over@@ sat them out of the Arabian - English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
book of Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens during each visit .
that I reconc@@ ile in the world of thy enchanting eyes
&quot; that I lose the occupation in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that any of the dangers are no matter , &quot;
&quot; everyone of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guar@@ di@@ ans &quot;
I for@@ got the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I am in every detail of your voice and words
I dream with passion for me
when your eyes are saying
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I will return soon to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to take back all the moments
and to smile about your absence and to smile .
I over@@ hau@@ l myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the ass@@ or@@ ting of Bass@@ el has written G@@ ha@@ zi :
a year goes to my soul
during and during
in your c@@ age I am ;
and you are still in the c@@ age of monsters
bas@@ eball history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the start of the protests in 2011 against the regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or were arrested by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; until 2016 , since 2011 the International Human Rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Sy@@ rer in H@@ ose since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand for the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption or res@@ ign@@ ant director of det@@ ention back on previous post
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ que deals with anger on a corruption , when a regime link after half of his sentence has returned to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is about Di@@ o@@ din@@ o Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants , sentenced by 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money st@@ amm@@ ers from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 Executive Board . &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released 2016 because of good guidance and now called his re @-@ setting into the company what happened on 19 April .
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Public Prosec@@ ution of the Republic , which has dealt with the application , there would be no obstacles to Cam@@ ba@@ za , again to its old post , as the company was no discipl@@ in@@ proceedings after its cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not good . &quot;
&quot; the Center for Public Health ( Centro de Integrated da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , an local institution committed to public transparency , distributed in an interview with the Deutsche Welle decision to launch the director , &quot;
&quot; represents a revers@@ al in the fight against corruption , and is the lack of transparency and even a revers@@ ing with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what we take to know is that also the company would have to initi@@ ate a disciplines against the refu@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; however , the company appeared however and b@@ ying no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ an social media , re@@ jects this behavior likewise , and considers the case as &quot; contradi@@ c@@ tory &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would have advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a sentence and had to eat the half . &quot;
&quot; he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could be advised and his image to pol@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has entered into the company re@@ integrated into the company that he helped damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will be paid for its silence . &quot;
ref@@ uted !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ tion and Student of Political Science in Brazil says , the director has no moral : &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za seen from the state because he in@@ quired not believe it could not believe someone in such a way that the state has already made so massive .
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the mor@@ als to return and to serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state but instead of herself not only by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state , as handmade it has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money , and the state itself has become tired , the pre@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison . &quot;
&quot; honest@@ ly speaking , I don &apos;t know why this man was really rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a th@@ ief in prison is : &quot;
&quot; Di@@ ebe belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ que will not only be remembered as the first independent president in memory , but also as sharp , c@@ utt@@ ings , and - side by said - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , as he was energetic , that &quot; a ambitious man is among all capable , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for its ambitions , its own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I do not know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not change from his ambitions . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , a ambitious man is criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also desired :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat 10 years and came off .
&quot; and today it sets him the company , in which he lost money , back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ ty / Period ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users at Un@@ right
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means her@@ edit@@ ary or ig@@ nition .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported
&quot; according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well known soci@@ ale network took their post from the net because it enth@@ used the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although about the origin of the word still is discussed , it is usually used to refer to people &apos;s indi@@ indi@@ an origin or generally used as addi@@ tives . &quot;
&quot; Facebook z@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or the other of the other ( in bur@@ mes@@ a font ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radi@@ al nation@@ alist movements were given to the word an extremely valuable con@@ not@@ ation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has a lot of sensu@@ al content on his platform . &quot;
Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with racism but the word itself is not automatically given by Hass@@ an .
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that post , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in its use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ic words with basic different mean@@ ings that have the same letter like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair at Bur@@ m@@ ese also called &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; written , which contains the same letters , as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( woo@@ dy ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; cal@@ arc@@ tic &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ dig@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
&quot; a post of one of my friends has been deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way , whether they were awake , how he can le@@ athers his back pain , by doing a word play . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ats is the opinion that they will reduce the Hass@@ an radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also that Facebook analy@@ tic ci@@ sts before it all the post@@ s sol@@ der , which in the sus@@ pic@@ ion of racial , racism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filter the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you are doing on fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do , is the post carefully analyze and control it by checking the side words . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( altern@@ ating ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ class nation@@ alists spread , spread the Hass@@ an , a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the Hass@@ an address , may not stop the efficiency of this strategy for long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords are often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or alternative writing of the tender word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ der Co@@ at , how Facebook began to delete his post@@ s , when he wanted to share his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is called : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new Directive of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and told me the Li@@ ke , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post office has not been correspon@@ ded to the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has removed a variety of Post@@ s of people who have no negative intentions , or simply try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ an &quot; nation@@ alists &quot; nation@@ alists . &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with Hass@@ an :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extre@@ mi@@ mer nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should do more , before the start of the initiative , for example the bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention , racism in Burma by their platform , but so it does not work . &quot;
such words to z@@ ens@@ eren will only bring more hat@@ red within the different communities .
&quot; moreover it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical assistance , and so words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out they did not make mistakes , they tried not to rep@@ el the fal@@ seh@@ oods . &quot;
&quot; if they had only something more respect for the 15 million health benefits , that would describe them a great sales , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make use of Facebook funny and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ an , to see if their Post@@ s are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Post@@ s , which have no Hass@@ an language , but nevertheless they were removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ish Text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and take a look at a Indian film .
&quot; just to try out whether Facebook is the post , which contains the word Cal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post b@@ lows &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screenshot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have been forced to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was declared for his failure , who critic@@ ises the pron@@ unci@@ ation Hass@@ an on his bur@@ mes@@ an pages under control , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; but instead rather than simply the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; to z@@ ens@@ eren , it would have been better ongoing , more likely on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Tr@@ ini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end to the children of children
a wedding ring in the sand .

the pa@@ ws is now illeg@@ ally in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now illegal .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted un@@ anim@@ ously un@@ anim@@ ously agreed upon the Parliament of the country to offer this practice so that the heat @-@ up age now lies at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of sp@@ ouses , some members of Hind@@ u and mus@@ li@@ ous religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja , the leader of the inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the leaders of the various religious groups of the country , that the state did not inter@@ f@@ ere , as that , age not the maturity of the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this is what happened to the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contrac@@ ting of the UN &apos;s rights law , the min@@ ors than , every man under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were with 15 were already married , in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 percent was , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 . &quot;
&quot; online petition and social @-@ media movements , the endeav@@ ors to create , laws to the children before , followed by the base and pleas@@ ing of great support . undoubtedly hal@@ ve them to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u @-@ leader for example had no concerns , the critics of the children of children to say , they condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition to tensions in this actually un@@ complicated cause , and at some point came doubt whether the opposition would not agree with the Legisl@@ ative Decree at all . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2017 , the Legisl@@ ative Decree was decided against the children of children - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree with the law and let the law announce the law .
&quot; one of the transm@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update , which reads Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again : &quot;
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the law@@ n@@ ment against the nur@@ sery was adopted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one on the other .
&quot; after having decided earlier in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were amazed because the laws on children have finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook @-@ Member Lov@@ ell Francis , which holds a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has been too much time and unnecessary smell needed to wear the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children is in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now illeg@@ ally , and this is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; during A@@ bel Jackson of opinion , it was definitely long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas exc@@ el that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which includes : , , Excellent news ! &quot;
the spouse has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; follow Mut@@ ota who belong to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that openly spoke openly about how important the passage of the law be , not@@ ated : &quot;
the hei@@ r@@ ative age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the ethnic group of 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the modification of the spouse was today , on 9 June 2017 , decided . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives there are 41 members , and thereof 35 were present at the vote . &quot;

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aja therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ at@@ an Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the best known Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; prior to months Mahar@@ aja has pro@@ claim@@ ing its intention to undertake judicial action , the law should be adopted , and he seems to be able to redeem His promises . &quot;
&quot; during the general state of Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said , unless Mahar@@ aja should proceed against the law , most of the social media users , one would lead the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , when we , instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that we would say that the state has to say to our bedrooms , that they may have been of great , hard @-@ fed males who are perhaps in advantage , would you be ready to continue discussing the discussion ? &quot;
or believe that it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in different gra@@ dations , or continue the standard , although there are laws that they are sub@@ contrac@@ ted . &quot;

created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over one month , Turkey un@@ lock the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle . &quot;
day for day becomes more evident than important the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV series off@@ ences against blo@@ cking .
&quot; although many techniques have been used to use envel@@ oping tools for rec@@ ated websites ( an current article of the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been reported by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report of the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society held at Harvard University , held regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; in China , Turkey is the most well @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , now several mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia , and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform can lay all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ators ) which makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content is in spite of legislative prohibition , but can be accessed . &quot;
in a blog@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blo@@ cking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on it , take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to look at least any Wikipedia content , even if you cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also gave that this step is independent from the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
however Vik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid lock .
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ sun@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ sen@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ ist similar mir@@ ror@@ sites when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ sol@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
there is no complete copy of a proxy address ; a Mir@@ ror .
one acc@@ esses to another URL which is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server leads the request for the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia even if this is locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; because this is executed by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot;

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around you , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poor@@ ly positioned moti@@ fs and balanced colors . &quot;
that motivated him yourself to carry a camera in yourself and try to commit the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , stri@@ ves to bring to the international scene at the age of 28 . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which guide the attention to Nep@@ al@@ wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook as he helps him the first @-@ class situation at his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I just rested from at home , when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called . he had received a call from my Father , that at the shore of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
the river da@@ mm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I burned with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had been watching him and showed me the place on the other river page , where the Leopard was there and I immediately began to cr@@ ush pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fear@@ ful as they look .
&quot; and he should know , because he stood Tig@@ ers already from faces to face : &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b from the opinion of the sheep at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was also found because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Buda appeared . he immediately sets us , and he got me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar , the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cked on environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ ali nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he wa@@ ited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent in order to make at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took photos and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live close to the tourist information . &quot;
please see some of these photos below .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az Kaly@@ m@@ a and originally published on Video Volunte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was released here as a part of a content sharing Convention .
in many parts of India it is avoiding women with great care to address the name of her husband or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to respect that they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should ab@@ used the norm to take this practice on life . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a def@@ ec@@ o@@ gue and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community , after having raised a hal@@ ted relatives with name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also do not call on behalf of name , is also common among men . however , they have much less to fear , if at all , they should not come to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health care , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and became quickly the main topic of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs which there is in 13 Indian States , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Ba@@ dal which is operated by the Community Video Volunte@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was worked for seven years with the help of their video camera in the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s rat up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
it reports on how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they are at the same time taken them in the thro@@ es of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion , was written by women who did not name her husband . &quot;
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem where women can easily identify .
&quot; the name of her husband is not noisy , a breeze is also maintained and never put into question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition tes@@ tified that a woman wants her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not keep this , is regarded as being depos@@ ited as a woman without morality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted in that we have never thought of these discussions .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who has never seen her husband before , at home , trying to try out how it works . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ mother and my husband still wei@@ gh long after the video was at the end .
&quot; intern@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I sol@@ ves him from now on at his name . &quot;
with this self confidence in the luggage launched Roh@@ ini started its first discussion .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh . &quot;
after the vide@@ o@@ projection women tried to bring discussion with a exercise in motion .
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant in , the name of her husband with various feelings to say - happy , ver@@ anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husband , but they can call us how they want it , means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husband about the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ he , from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ chen of a century @-@ old tradition , in the married women the name of her husband . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise just before himself , a different decided to settle the whole an@@ il@@ ted fru@@ stration against him and his family by passing it away . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ alin with an ancient br@@ aking , the women decided that they would actually try to name her husband at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
&quot; the husband called a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head , and his wife could not stop his name . &quot;
another servant @-@ member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; her mother @-@ in @-@ law she died , she got fear and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I sol@@ ves it . &quot;
a husband a husband in was less compreh@@ ension and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of galvan@@ ic red dot on the forehead , which indicates the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the galvan@@ ic red spot , if he also works . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to it to bear him .
&quot; the other women did not come complete with it , but my , they are now in a better position , even to choose him in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with each discussion . &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I do not want to worry that the women could make sure that what could hear , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days into their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they audi@@ tioned and spoke about things that they never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have some things , for example , like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they are at one . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have been worn only Sar@@ is .
&quot; for most it is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ar @-@ spa , a broad Shirt of a h@@ ose , carry ; they have not dre@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of war and discussion about the advantages of your own clos@@ ets , mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , tasted Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ der ) into a discussion , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they decided now to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; to the question , whether in the five months has been changed since their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly get into roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times but then listened to the name of her husband &apos;s husband to say .
&quot; some , included me , make it still , but only when they are alone and no other family members are doing so . &quot;
only one or two will continue to say the name of her husband ; only one or two women now contribute at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
&quot; the women in the discussion , know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the che@@ ering for more freedom of movement or its own clos@@ ets - at the end of a hard to navig@@ ating river . &quot;
&quot; as they give each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
&quot; but this club , each of us gives us confidence that will change something . &quot;
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home and tell other people about what we talk about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

screenshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on 29 June of this year , the has@@ ht@@ ag was not likely to find out of the trade show ( Beat@@ les memorial ) in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans re@@ eds memories of re@@ eds and their esteem for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in Japan occurred in Japan as a turn @-@ off in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war period .

&quot; for just five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this has been easy to rot@@ ate the Japanese . &quot;
people here quite quickly become clear that they didn &apos;t have any other choice than to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their Zen@@ it when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
&quot; the music of the K@@ ult@@ band is &quot; more than a universal language like English , &quot; told Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the Retail Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! ! Today is the Beat@@ les memorial in Japan . for example , 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; today , songs of the Beat@@ les are still being sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese Kara@@ oke bars and in the English @-@ lessons of Japanese mid@@ schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survived everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial .
we all love in our house the Beat@@ les .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; -@@ d@@ oll John L@@ enn@@ on should be present or not .
&quot; and as it belongs to fans , Japanese of course also make trips to the known places that are related to the band . &quot;

this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published within the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the fall of the domestic Chinese dis@@ president Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has given attention in the international community , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June , that he has been delivered to the hospital because of liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after the draft of the Charter 08 , a Mani@@ fes@@ to that demands the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the No@@ bel Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China has said Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , and a speaker tells , he did not need it as a &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to give views from the international community , the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Se@@ ed Li@@ u X@@ ia , allowing him to permit a treat abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely out of the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations Com@@ miss@@ ary of Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese official to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker bor@@ row@@ ed it , however , to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to permit Li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have consec@@ rated to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway are sto@@ cking to the Sto@@ cks , after the No@@ bel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government was postpon@@ ed that this ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the Sal@@ mon to China since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news had spread that Li@@ u had seriously fallen ill , the No@@ bel @-@ Committee put his hope for an unconditional release and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to its inc@@ eption , he was not able to take his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6th , the European Parliament adopted a decision when China was promp@@ ted to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house @-@ rest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the peak of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China also for the release of Li@@ us , as they said in an Declaration on June 30th : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us E@@ he@@ wife , as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; you should meet all your visits and receive , who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;

Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may be stupid , since Singapore is recognised on an international level as an independent state . &quot;
&quot; however , according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be seen in Singapore as a city . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international subsidiary of the State Chamber of New York , the Minister , that many people cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because Singapore is compared to other countries . &quot;
he suppor@@ tive that Singapore should be considered as a town .
nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io coated the Minister of Justice to rot@@ ate the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itative exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable land , you can say that we are ultimately no country . &quot;
&quot; it was like vul@@ gar , it had the sem@@ bl@@ ance of a escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory violation . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am mentioned reasons were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of which he appeared to und@@ it@@ ably und@@ em@@ ocratic . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore was compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanent from a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old suffering from the author@@ it@@ arian fe@@ eders who will be pre@@ dict@@ ate Democrats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic because they adapt better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final week , the answers were given in the last week of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am answers to his American guests concerning our press , our J@@ udi@@ c@@ atives , our political system really non @-@ responses . &quot;
corresponding questions he wor@@ shipped with non @-@ responses of rational kind .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am to make his opinion clear since they did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; in Singapore no country , but a city is , so to what country belongs to our city ... &quot;
short I understand nothing .
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ gling would take the trouble to clear this point , provided that it was highly paid to be part of the Government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the Blog he published his comment on the reviews that you should begin to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city or land . &quot;
read the wording .
&quot; as he said that Singapore rather a &quot; city &quot; is as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore was so un@@ equal , even if we look forward to free and fair elections . &quot;
he went to Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party ) .
&quot; he said , Singapore &quot; is not a land , &quot; he obviously did not take it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment on Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who is as a leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ emic statement . &quot;
&quot; I have said about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old gar@@ ds , what I expected - be with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubts , and I am not even sure whether he really believes it correctly and aware what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review m@@ ates the weaknesses of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Arg@@ um@@ bers :
has Mr Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; gut@@ believing a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ udi@@ an speakers ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be viewed as an independent and sover@@ eign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country enter the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the cabin , the statements of Mr Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am is of serious importance . &quot;
why does the Lon@@ gl@@ ans make their military service do not defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; ten@@ ds the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city : &quot;
&quot; I did not say , what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have den@@ oun@@ ced lots of av@@ oc@@ ans ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian NE@@ D Fl@@ anders .
screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your location or home country ?
their answers will be published here as a part of an ongoing series with the ru@@ m@@ ors of certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , which lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question I asked me in Japan , is what is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; answered I &quot; . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation is taking place , it is regarded as courteous , interest in his inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es by providing personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then usually the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many cann@@ adi@@ er cook might be in@@ war@@ dly by anger , if they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t distur@@ b it . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Kan@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans a can@@ adian flag can be well visible on their back@@ pack , if they travel . &quot;
all love can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ...
&quot; it was like I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , in front of the mar@@ sch in Iraq and before the 11th of September . &quot;
Canadian have always carried little A@@ hor@@ n@@ ets at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there are no weapons !
gender @-@ gender marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are courteous .
&quot; we clearly say very often &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is suppos@@ edly considered to be the toler@@ ant country facing ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we are Canadian .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I very ad@@ mi@@ red . &quot;
I would not do anything if you would like to switch to Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first , : as &apos; nice &apos; described , is basically to be sp@@ ill - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure NE@@ D Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has an own Canadian double @-@ ri@@ ans ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada would really be a nation full of people like NE@@ D Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &apos; nice &apos; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing , where you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless to be un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting and not to make any attention .
&quot; this may be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remot@@ ely from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main part of the Canary Islands . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own matters .
&quot; what is regarded as &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness that I have now connecting with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au the stage to show that Kan@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &apos; nice &apos; . our Prime Minister has Canada just made sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zed , which 2014 will restore power and despite their speaking the civil government , continues to re@@ igns the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told about what rules to him his girlfriend .
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video refers directly to the lasting military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was pra@@ ised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was great success .
&quot; in the first three days , the video posted on Facebook was dealt with up@@ loaded Video 1.@@ 254 and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; the dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activi@@ sts saw the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies , as well as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta domination . &quot;
&quot; take a look at once these recordings of the video , relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has been pursu@@ ing in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dr@@ ak@@ onic section of 44 of the pro@@ visional Constitution that has been given to the upper@@ most absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues .
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for the &quot; introduction &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activi@@ sts , politicians and other individuals affected by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to bear activi@@ sts and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army to control the online content and individuals , which acc@@ used the monarchy , the monarchy is tr@@ aded to prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand consists of a Stri@@ pe against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( majest@@ y ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was established in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a cou@@ p of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be prosec@@ uted to buy their choice expensive tube boats , although security experts war@@ ned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people will be thrown into a black shipment , before you bring them into an inter@@ ruption @-@ camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in j@@ ail , because they are suppos@@ edly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and internet users will cr@@ ush the monarchy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the te@@ aser of the song members of the band showed the sal@@ ut of &quot; &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; &quot; which has already been used by cou@@ p opponents during the protests of 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri statues , was published first on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia . especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian war was officially finished , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al are showing striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ kov are located in the carbon @-@ bas@@ ins of Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , de@@ preci@@ ation , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today the largest part of Russians living and ch@@ asen live in the area .
such settlements are also called in Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es also Gei@@ ster@@ cities .
&quot; in the post @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here today are only a few hundred people in these s@@ ages . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district 16.@@ 000 people , after having barely had risen over a decade . &quot;
1989 approximately 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; all is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960 &apos;s , the Chr@@ is@@ mat@@ ch@@ uch@@ ow@@ kas are symbo@@ lic@@ ally known for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are tr@@ aded and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local old man .
he begins a conversation and it is hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is all a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with an infl@@ atable splend@@ or @-@ buildings .
&quot; the people who lived once in this place , and their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district . &quot;
in the Gei@@ ster@@ city D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live approximately fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ is@@ ht@@ ow@@ ai , which are still one or two families can host , one det@@ ects from the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother is forbidden for us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply has forbidden to us , that is all . &quot;
the girl wh@@ is@@ pers with her girlfriend and suddenly leave them the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ qu@@ oise mining company named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ing industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for the self @-@ demand ) such as cattle farming , be@@ eke@@ eping and mixtures . &quot;
it is difficult to get to the l@@ aps .
the District administration provides free candles and bread for the villages in winter .

&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago an older woman drew with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighbourhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ sch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off @-@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in desc@@ ending , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants not to accept financial aid from her daughter and ins@@ ist that she supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a gem@@ s nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are we visit us .
&quot; but we cannot constantly do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a her to . &quot; you said , we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I already prepared the ground .
&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we become zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as spok@@ es@@ person in Nat@@ asch@@ a has lived together with her husband and the five common children in their home for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when war started .
every day she reminds us of the village with war .
&quot; despite the relatives that live in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es was simply gone ) , they had not the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day how the city and the war once were .
when our talk comes to an end that bur@@ ns a small boy over us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy tells him back .
he plays with the ball that goes down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while running , some of them throw stones on the dec@@ aying building . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood to care for in@@ tru@@ thful in their lives .
you do not know it different .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; home &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acken was released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org , and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican City of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a little woman with a cor@@ als pink , and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy @-@ bears . &quot;
she is called Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was raised in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know a lot under the name M@@ om Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it has become a goal for Afri@@ k@@ aner and Hai@@ tian who are on the transit .
the hotel has rather no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleeping the guests in simple rooms , with fireplace , cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the room there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a c@@ age .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you M@@ om Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
you do not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they can not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ lot that can take away from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if my Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has pos@@ ited a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) with Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , which hopes to get to Boston to find their husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other guides of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a familiar name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often travel along the track and that the Afri@@ cans are already speaking on the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App of Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his companion has lived Michel@@ et previously in Brazil and has worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship .
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he has started his journey into the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he s@@ ells SIM Cards , to save the necessary money to buy the B@@ usti@@ cket to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; he smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always be in contact . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests are often send text news , when they go left to greet them or to tell you about the course of their journey . &quot;
she explained that their Christian faith of the drive of their work is .
&quot; they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare their ch@@ ick@@ ens like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spar@@ kling hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter took Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family in their little house .
he is police and has established that the B@@ usti@@ ckets are to be sold to numerous African immigrants .
&quot; he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
at the moment there are 25 people there mostly Hai@@ tian .
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ er outside . &quot;
&quot; Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains , that he knows what the guests can go through . &quot;
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ d@@ ova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to for@@ war@@ ring the money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a well @-@ known , one @-@ re@@ inde@@ er , has offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; some months later the family lives still there , and they try to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests .
in the courses they consult the travellers quiet their teleph@@ ones .
&quot; a small bus is arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that their house is full , but it is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother slept in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ genuine , who has made her a manifestation , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old . &quot;
she is sad while she shows them briefly .
&quot; Y@@ a se fu@@ eron , &quot; &quot; repeated them every time . &quot; &quot; they are already continuing . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their phones to install a surveillance app .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter @-@ users , or of the number of consumers . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities in the West of China , are comp@@ elled to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their hand . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July the mobile users at the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the town Uru@@ m@@ qi , a cell notification , in which they points the District government to install a surveillance app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the notification , the app is said to obtain access to a terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities det@@ ects the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women in the Autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had been installed shortly after they had installed the app , messages with a private we@@ aker group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police stood that the app would determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists and follow , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs Website describes the app as below :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service , with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ bo@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ age por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control your home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; Remote &quot; &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker can manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region .
&quot; while announ@@ cements about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China most often concentrate on the experience of users across the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er for those who live in remote , printed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to restrict un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme customs and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ active Internet de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; this published on Twitter @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; images from the China &quot; ( of the other belonging products ) , the delicate news in China published , showed photos of a check@@ point , at the polic@@ emen , the inhabitants had either un@@ checked whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you &apos;re going to be discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have been forced to use these people , which are intended for elderly people to use . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity due to the rest of w@@ aking technology .
we are back again in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the China &quot; ( of the other belonging to the other &apos;s of products ) also published a j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can up@@ lift the passwords requirement for a Windows operating system , and thereby the access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang Computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a response to the instructions of the city party Council to minimize the spread of illegal contents .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and related institutions including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office at the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report of Freedom House , a US @-@ American human organisation organization , also mentioned this new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi into a regulation with the directive on all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obvious to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; , however , this action is in@@ ju@@ red for a whole range of other possible outcomes , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
sleep or death part 1 : everything cr@@ ying to death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at you and see you that you are all alone in a place where all is most important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dis@@ solved , and revealed a truth which is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both inside and outside . &quot;
one who makes her name all the honor .
one that has turned into a list of feelings and expres@@ sions that does not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get the reality again and you behind the scenes - beyond the ac@@ tresses , the beautiful scenes and the perform@@ er - turn the characters in essence of flesh and blood , and cry unto death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve yourself in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of salvation . you will clear that you have been caught here between the walls , who have built your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone was built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they were arrested and arrested my father three times , but that didn &apos;t work , so I mean &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the leader of the security service , it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he put his power over us by proof of even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were refresh@@ ed during a peaceful protests like weed from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it came out , so that the city broke the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ga@@ ze &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all city districts , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , ra@@ ining , at the wrong time , even if I made no high demands on a city that is to be st@@ amp@@ ed up into the ar@@ ter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the third night things had a bit cal@@ med down , after the power supply in the quarter would be able to function . &quot;
&quot; I en@@ forced the still@@ ness , by sh@@ ep@@ ed several times &quot; &quot; all@@ ahu &quot; &quot; of my house . &quot;
I listened to my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends were cour@@ ageous enough to find .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we appeal to a pra@@ ised picture that met my expectations . &quot;
in such a moment you become aware that you are reli@@ ve the spirit from the lamp but it is simply not interested in the sc@@ ari@@ sten .
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he placed on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can drop down - nothing can give you your voice , after you put them all the way up to the office of the safety service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there as I now . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear me how you &apos;re &quot; &quot; it &quot; , &quot; or you are only mu@@ sty enough to cry out unless we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ t eyes are looking forward to me .
&quot; and thou mo@@ urn you really , what to look in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was at my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure I said , &quot; I could not think that she had forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never stopped to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fat@@ al consequences for me , and yet I am not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; lies him in single , and his father equal to it . &quot;
&quot; his father equal to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bases of this wast@@ ed proposition is up to the present day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture , which I was suspended monthly . &quot;
I cry out the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; then again by the farm and into the second office , which leads through a course to the individual cells . &quot;
I saw all the details exactly before I super@@ v@@ ise the room .
&quot; otherwise , they probably have a larger cell to me this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with only one single det@@ ain@@ ees , and should immediately put me immediately , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I went back to an old proven communication method : with the Faust against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my sword was a &quot; &quot; awakening &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he answered me ultimately . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells , a well @-@ known man middle ages , which is similar to me and called &quot; doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness can be seen at me no mark@@ ers , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to me ? &quot;
all the answers are an existence .
perhaps he was lost in one of the large cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had in@@ sured me , they would be fre@@ ed when I stay . &quot;
li@@ ar .
I &apos;d like to have had a bird @-@ n@@ asty to distribute all these cro@@ wing , which lab@@ elled themselves in the morning in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; at the distance , I am hearing them still &quot; &quot; All @-@ ahu &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be at least 10 p.m. in the evening ; always around this time the fri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the color of verse , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; cl@@ ash on the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; this was the secret to protect the state security in front of us , and prevent the betra@@ ying and terrorists in us , speak them in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their conf@@ essi@@ onal black@@ mailing card and dism@@ is@@ sed the close view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which here is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se that they call co@@ existence to transform the crime of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ vised the hear@@ ings and tre@@ aches to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and com@@ man@@ ent man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the face expres@@ sions : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life when you join these Tag@@ edi@@ ble and protest to demonstrations that anyway will soon find an end . &quot;
I do not answer .
I acc@@ used it to answer .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation has become an ordinary communication means .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to be , pun@@ ished , even though I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
to punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to pl@@ uck me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; &quot; conc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably dates back to the clo@@ cks .
your ex@@ ecu@@ tioner is at your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you can not measure you with him and you can not hold your hor@@ semen . &quot;
&quot; my cri@@ es fell by him not enough , which is why they re@@ ex@@ ed the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first ar@@ rest , I asked me if the investig@@ ators had worked as a gar@@ bage dump or if it was the normal working class . &quot;
&quot; they left four cable in order to present us , from their view , great in@@ vention of a huge cabinet . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them changed , while I was still at the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I heard . &quot;
the Hen@@ ker pronounced the cooling and was not at all about it ; why he called for an elec@@ tro @-@ loaded St@@ ab .
&quot; current through all the body , enough to supply my whole district . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ snack body , the out@@ stretched on the ground was the perfect electric conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must probably be so at midnight .
I decided to lay myself again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours left , which came to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I responded with the voice of a exhaus@@ tible youths : &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; be silent and run away , you will un@@ swe@@ pt . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ anic Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spoke about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ ked a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken from A@@ man Ma@@ dan , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends the bulk of his time ; sometimes it sl@@ ed@@ ed to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , to his computer and also to his couch . &quot;
but what can be left to discover is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or with ni@@ cot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
&quot; he has lived in the top floor of his family house , which had joined them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel was forced to fle@@ e his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had forced to fle@@ e from their village in Palestine in which she had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist that faces the conservative majority and asks their old proven opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; with his music , often faced with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation in Palestinian refugees , but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world . all of these issues are not only available in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that have weal@@ thy Damascus in Syria until San@@ aa in Y@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is restricted in his mind , and he can feel according to their own statement by people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he is not open to the American foreign policy , there is a special incl@@ ination against the U.S. American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art at his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b believes that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas , something that he was born with his identity as &quot; Palestinian @-@ fle@@ e of the second generation &quot; , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own living conditions so , &quot; stres@@ ses h@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , while he sh@@ ook in water n@@ ests in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan . at that time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ anic law also involves that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand a cup of coffee on a sen@@ tim@@ ingly hot jun@@ k has little to do with protest against Islam .
&quot; basically , the cl@@ amping warm coffee and the sw@@ elling of the c@@ ent c@@ ig@@ ette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you throw a view into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; of this reason , one simply avo@@ ids to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ram@@ adan waters - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the interior of Jord@@ an@@ iens has cancelled an appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic action of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ing that sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual fron@@ ts of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional standards of the country resist@@ ed and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the members and former press conference in the Islamic coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ b@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ er . &quot;
&quot; many claim , the commitment of the band &apos;s involvement in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world was more dangerous activ@@ ism that constitutes the former legitimacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la das j@@ ord@@ ana people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to stand for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely to be simply s@@ ain@@ ted rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but in fact reflected in a clear clear reality in Jordan that occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s plant clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional sex experience at Lei@@ be , by drawing his vision of the fate of Arab women , who have sex oral sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of a obviously supp@@ res@@ ated un@@ familiar woman , their arms and legs up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , in Jordan , the number of &quot; Honor@@ ary &quot; Honor@@ ary &quot; has increased - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch was estimated that the number of Honor@@ ary murder in 2016 reached their peak ; however , Jordan is still sc@@ ared that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried sacrific@@ ing victims or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for breaking control from the year 1954 women , who are exposed to the danger of internal family , and for their release is often an years of bureau@@ cratic effort , as well as the guarantee on the part of the family , that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Musik enjoys great popularity and is also known for it , nor to be returned to topics in his country as a tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b holds that his work is politically , however , however , that he is his music which is full of explicit acceptance of sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not of politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man . &quot;
&quot; I was put into politics , &quot; &quot; says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs , which are in the core politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and any other is it too . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words , &quot; what you want , &quot; is it faith or non @-@ faith , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noticed that there is hardly any person in Jordan over the rights of g@@ ay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still strongly influenced in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b brought an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ ana On@@ line@@ Program Ro@@ ya , to record later that his comments made out of the context , revol@@ t , and his opinion had been c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a working version , &quot; he says . &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires H@@ da@@ i@@ b open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als do not un@@ cover the Islam .
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a po@@ et of the eighth , who still remained in mind thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what was to work once on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ ops , in the eighth @-@ century openly about homosexu@@ ality could write , why can Jordan do not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so h@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom , there is nothing new more that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are to be silent . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Austrian Intelligence service took a number of former government officials and members of the teacher association , with the reason , they would have vo@@ iced based on comments in social media , which coinci@@ ded with the deep in the country ro@@ oting corruption . &quot;
&quot; given the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a continuous type of giving and taking off Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la has now opened a performance for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - thus sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and in@@ comparable changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the civil society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs also , of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreams not only dreams of his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of it , to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is involved with music , art and literature of a genuine and basic openness - and not by bom@@ bs , Stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and in artificial way . at least , he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and therefore res@@ ist res@@ ist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these large , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ ps are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas so that the soli@@ ds , the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years were built in the armies of the west of Japan to force the Indi@@ genous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the knee . &quot;
we are at Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could sn@@ ap a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted an two mon@@ ati@@ ge exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I saw myself for a long time the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two forts are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and to spend a breathtaking way of this summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was here and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high soli@@ ds was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rare appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help promote the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ s . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the city of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ b and illegal drugs . &quot;
one survey conducted in April 2017 that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more norm@@ alities in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can provide this elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity , even has an annual event inspired , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ ser &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os , &quot; which has place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts to show one another to show , who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks as one can see in the following video ( see other videos on current competitions on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to see young people of it , to deposit their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice for training in the hair@@ dressing tools that allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated from this activity and the other opportunities have seen do@@ z@@ ens of young people that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special apprentic@@ eship workshops before the beginning of March and reported about some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love @-@ rie@@ fe to Gu@@ err@@ illa

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribut@@ ors to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ler , which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love b@@ rie@@ fe to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel st@@ olen , affection ? &quot;
&quot; this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activi@@ sts , Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation ( Let@@ as p@@ or la R@@ econ@@ cili@@ aci@@ ón ( Let@@ ters to reconciliation ) , the young people write to write gu@@ err@@ illa letters . &quot;
&quot; only in short , her country had a position of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ a@@ Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Latin America ) , forms the short@@ cut of the longest conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; International was the sig@@ nat@@ ories of the peace treaty , as so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos has been awarded for his mer@@ its in the No@@ bel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bian , however , there is a long way to be able to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ps , who have lived for many years in illegal wareh@@ ouses , and around the clock to have their weapons in their tru@@ ction , must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had used to life in constant fear and in some cases deep@@ ened hat@@ red against gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ es , these now needs to record them in their ranks and support them in setting up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian would have to close together and help with the integration process .
and this they did so : until now I have written thousands of young people letters - love message to former gu@@ err@@ illa to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ fs that should be passed personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation was founded on the World Summit of the No@@ bel Peace Prize winner who took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi in 2014 was awarded the No@@ bel Prize . &quot;
&quot; stated that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day of thousands of love b@@ rie@@ fe , but those forget that they need much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he is planning , told he to share his love with people this year to share the most urgent promise . &quot;
&quot; in this way the plan , letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC to write their place in society and have to establish a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the framework of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March at one of the UN stocks in the Cal@@ don@@ o region in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students of J@@ aver@@ iana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ al Auth@@ orities of Cal@@ i and Leonardo presented by the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art in the camp to give personal letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set up as they had done earlier in order to take the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ epts , but letters of teaching people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can run in just a few hours - from fear through to happiness and everything , which in between is , &quot; &quot; told the politicians , Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra is a employee of the Govern@@ ors of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca - this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we had passed the letters led me a former figh@@ ter from the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a type hut , where the gu@@ err@@ illa ( living ) saw , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa , who wrote a little . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed there was a m@@ GL p@@ light , a deadly weapon in the Dorn@@ b@@ schen@@ schl@@ af . &quot;
&quot; I spoke to him anyway and asked : &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; he answering said , &quot; I responded to a letter that someone has written me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answered him suddenly the t@@ ears about the che@@ eks . &quot;
I h@@ ug@@ ged him completely and put me next to the Gran@@ at@@ cher .
&quot; perhaps he was the war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this struggles , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life as war . himself , the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there that is waiting with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as previously war and the F@@ ARC already acted in the dark .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and give an insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced , how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this size order it is profitable to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who have never heard yet heard , and recognize that people who often have seen as mon@@ ster and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings were aston@@ ished by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; reality , in which the country lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it com@@ for@@ ting me that all men - even those who are killed and so much damage to us , and give us a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote an example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was proph@@ esi@@ ed that after the de@@ ar@@ ming peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to grasp the weapons and to protest to their rights and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we chose the F@@ ARC now on peace , at a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call on all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology - they belong to all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victims , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; it follows the translation of an article , which was written by uns@@ rem Partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ o and took place the initial publication on the OC Media website . &quot;
&quot; hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - e.g. discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
with fri@@ ght activi@@ sts have experienced the reporting of the past months over the persecution of Ch@@ echn@@ ya in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat , which like an Dam@@ o@@ cle@@ ans over the dor@@ m LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only emerged above the night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who has shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q position in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered the international head@@ lines after several months , after reports have been published , which covers the slow@@ ing , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Czech Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , the sus@@ pic@@ ious que@@ er men and made them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she had sen@@ sed that she was in reality a woman .
&quot; when they grow , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of p@@ inch had experienced their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for their lives , they made the final ent@@ ment into the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer assistant at a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a acquain@@ tance of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ wife who put in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , made someone of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread them anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his che@@ et@@ ched friends , with following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents went through the whole wh@@ ats app . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just trying to bring some shopping places from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned me , I feel something in my body , but I did not hurt anything . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a phrase , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you still desire the family to escape , you kill ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
I just know that it was a young man no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and the final end in the hospital again .
&quot; apparently , some women had got everything and started to cry out . &quot;
the man was f@@ lown .
the women had called an ambulance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two key@@ ring w@@ oun@@ ds in my right @-@ pul@@ ous pul@@ mon@@ ary . &quot;
OC Media : in what hospitals were you laid - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor did not stand and put me among the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it to do with the fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ ar , a k@@ ill@@ ful name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - Related , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ sad .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; the required to return me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they made absurd demands : some told me , I kis@@ ses it that I wanted them in the official TV in Gros@@ ny , saying that I had not changed my sex in the official TV , that everything was only fl@@ ech@@ tre@@ ach , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have bask@@ ets C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this printing ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older men said once my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that not only has your family , but the entire Republic was ash@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; we can not sti@@ r you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother was too much , and she placed a stri@@ ck around the neck . &quot;
luck@@ ily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to switch the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later the window stood by car with dark@@ ens windows and a numer@@ ic shield with a 95 .
once it happened for the third time it was clear that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends check the numer@@ ic signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you f@@ lown out ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activi@@ sts .
&quot; for safety reasons I will not say her name , but I will say that I remember them all , they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then a little un@@ belief . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without regi@@ stering , without any reference , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stran@@ ger .
I stuck the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not think about , you are warmer in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you looking for in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality , but this is a t@@ apping topic . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements still tr@@ age I still in me .
so very I wish to also wish this spiritual barrier I cannot overcome .
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble as the person watch out of which she re@@ members themselves from her past - so to my mascul@@ ine form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed dor@@ sal ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I have made a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I find current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has to eat one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he completed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they are now on family and relatives .
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives before , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so called &quot; honor &quot; through blood Gen@@ ug@@ hness . &quot;
OC Media : are also now tr@@ unc@@ ated in these myst@@ eries now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says it would not be very many .
&quot; if , then especially such that have no rich relatives or were dropped from their relatives to stand Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be re@@ brought , you will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked either your village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but rather sub@@ merged to radic@@ alize themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this only one mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I have just got someone who was det@@ ained one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown the be@@ ard .
there was since then nothing new of them .
they simply have taken them .
&quot; and this so called Lord , this person was even taken as these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; but until now , they were not presented as band@@ its , so there were no reports yet . we suppose that such actions are possible . &quot;
why else could it not be allowed to shave it ?
&quot; know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already very big when I still lived there - and I never had problems .
at the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the shar@@ ia was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia initially wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but finally he has thrown back into the stop@@ over . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were dot@@ ted ; I had colored eyelashes , carried Tu@@ be@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops . &quot;
the security of the shar@@ ia of the shar@@ ia has never hung me only a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; she knew why men , young people , there met . &quot;
we have never been vic@@ t@@ orious .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a re@@ use : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is : &quot; sp@@ otte not about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
&quot; one often says to children , if who make himself fun with sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never ins@@ ult@@ ed me never ch@@ ased and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this grace be kept ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
&quot; as he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began to speak on TV on morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us by se , but primarily on the behavior of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel like the people in the city began to change .
&quot; who had formerly lived and yel@@ lowed , viewed you at once with Arg@@ is@@ n . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; every time I came back home , I was able to feel how the situation in the Republic has been steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earned a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much .
&quot; apart from that , I still am active as an active player . &quot;
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I come uni@@ on@@ ere with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ ups , meetings , I support her to hospital and help them to get Essen@@ ti@@ des . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for it .
&quot; I have discovered these people themselves , when I swe@@ pt away . &quot;
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : enter a Hid@@ d@@ f ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ bern .
so is nature that has nothing to do with religion
&quot; this is exactly the same as the p@@ inch , who want to turn to you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no g@@ ay with them . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have which the Kab@@ ak@@ er have which , the Russians also have , and on all the planet it is - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , therefore it is unpleasant to listen . &quot;
I tre@@ ad here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who walk into the mosque and during Ram@@ adan they live together with men .
&quot; know many think about Tran@@ si@@ denti@@ ty on men who love men , and they believe that you are going to make their sex to make more intimate experiences . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be accurate , different living settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ash@@ amed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I am here so personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n in front of an increase of self @-@ murder in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high employment and poverty rate within the domestic Arab population .
since the last months there is a strong increase of self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , in the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ ame@@ ful for his own help to come to the in@@ ability to his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; one on YouTube shared video made the moments when he had con@@ fir@@ ed herself , firm . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was put into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ ic@@ ide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activi@@ sts were war@@ n before that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab B@@ ani Tam@@ im - hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : there were all family members , who made themselves f@@ aint because of the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ able to feed their families and to maintain a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large majority of Iran live in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to ride their livel@@ ih@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago was the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z a primarily autonom@@ ous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy , took over power and 1925 major efforts , to end ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the oil and gas fields as well as some of the rich@@ est and most valuable plac@@ ements for agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slowly , and the locals get only little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated disorders , hunger and hard@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime has denied Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arabs systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dem@@ s , built the water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dem@@ ons have only led to destro@@ ying the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and the local farming as well as the fish and palms industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth went up to 81 % .
&quot; NO@@ UR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Irish General Director of cooperation , work and social welfare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a job , the basic school completed , 55 % a secondary school ends and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Irish Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ mor@@ den among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse , the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z newly re@@ coming ethnic Per@@ ls and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the integration process : &quot;
&quot; as functional and institutions are not preferred to be Arabian labour , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ ih@@ ood outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their preferences and post @-@ names to hide and to hide their belonging to Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arabic names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , wel@@ ded as the speaking of Arabic language or the coll@@ agen Arab clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances , which have to end@@ ure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , the human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for su@@ ic@@ ide is pricel@@ ist depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ ic@@ ide is avoi@@ dable .

&quot; the following article is an updated version of the opinion which was posted by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i , and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . this article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , responding to many women - especially white women , who call themselves as an inter@@ se@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ist@@ ers - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even place well thought of scientific and social arguments against me , why I should be femin@@ ist , and why we generally hear all femin@@ ist * inside . &quot;
&quot; for example , women nowadays are still less money despite the same education as men . &quot;
&quot; that women still stand under strict observation , when it is about what they are allowed to do with their body . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidem@@ ic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women gain earlier or later in various areas of life to a glass blank@@ et , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced that I am twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to speak to skin colour , racism , black women in the LGB@@ T @-@ community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I have been considering what kind of we are physically and verbal , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , a lot of white femin@@ ists have to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , they agree that women - all women - come together to raise their voices and sing &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk , that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence gives an institu@@ tion@@ alized form rac@@ ist motiv@@ ating violence that we are exposed to black women . &quot;
&quot; or above that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ es and origin , less deserve as white men and women . &quot;
that black girls and girls are referred to with a migration background of the school as a white girl because of the visible integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want to join all the women , all the men and all people with no skin colour ; on the other hand , I cannot consider myself as a black woman in whose center the white woman , who refuse to consider inj@@ ustice in their mind , both on the gender and on the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and I will not fight any more to fight my belonging in a white femin@@ ist oriented Sp@@ h@@ ere , which always rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner acc@@ used 18@@ 51 in their speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and I also wei@@ gh me to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is a human being a human and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I wei@@ gh me to join me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b through cultural exposure to our customs and customs , to advance to their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to set white women the importance of reason@@ ing of skin colour and gender equality . for some of them continue to do the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them by a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ se@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different income , and at the point of view from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to dis@@ solve myself full of femin@@ ism and to connect me to the movement of the w@@ om@@ an@@ ism that is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ se@@ dal phenomenon is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres , which are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves by asking ourselves on our own way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that the black woman can do . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ se@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately called separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can up@@ lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as part of my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this paradig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life neither sur@@ passed , nor ignored . &quot;

&quot; again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a in the last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow its relationship to the rivers , the region and the impact of pollution to its church . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear@@ ed that the decades of war , the construction of shr@@ ubs , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;

Paraguay . women and her difficult fight against violence
a group of women poses &quot; The cr@@ ying women &quot; to express their pain over the women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and to show their rejection .

the following article is the shortened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; this article belongs to the number # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ é ) who reported on women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed for the protection of the affected persons .
&quot; a polic@@ eman said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they have nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ ual partner who has become violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship was a bit of time passed and the police declared , their statement would be placed at the acts , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as a further Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to Mis@@ sions , it also showed the ak@@ ten@@ ant display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved their ad .
breaking the famine of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women gain once an ad , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases the women also depend on men dependent on men , which are mis@@ leading . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit , victims of violence should be reported at all at the prosec@@ ution authorities . &quot;
content 1 loop and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that is nothing more than imm@@ t@@ 3 Paraguay . laws : good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent implementation of b@@ lows and statistics
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mis@@ leading , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , resear@@ cher for pleas@@ ures on Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ economic research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports , which however do not even proc@@ ure the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , at the District Prosec@@ ution 9@@ 600 ads went on for domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it went for violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace of peace . also here 86 % of the ads have arrived .
&quot; in the ads said 40 % of women , that they were physically bre@@ ast@@ ed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological missions . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women of Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these off@@ ences are actually displayed in fact . &quot; &quot; on every woman who will be re@@ imb@@ ursed in Paraguay due to psychological missions , come 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman who will be re@@ imb@@ ursed to every woman , the two women who do not do this , &quot; stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s su@@ ic@@ ide in Paraguay is no own off@@ ence , the prosec@@ ution authorities cannot be adequ@@ ately documented as many women are ass@@ ass@@ inated by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists have at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ ic@@ ide in the country alone . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days dies a woman because of violence . &quot;

invisible missions and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z the firm friend of Carlos Vera was he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all their former friends .
&quot; in the beginning she did not really wanted it , but after . this should she always rep@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but two years , she carried out the psych@@ ic violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able : &quot;
I have never thought that I would have been victims of mis@@ ery .
&quot; if I read earlier about it , I always thought that only women have happened to sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they decei@@ ve themselves by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report on the Mis@@ sions by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which they describe his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had been isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic whether he ever asked the hand for her and conc@@ ede that his behaviour was also a form of mis@@ ery . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mary &apos;s why she had fallen for such a long time ago and not left him before .
&quot; it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of Mis@@ sions had at least a certain complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which origin@@ ates not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partners ref@@ used them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of Mis@@ sions .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : you take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psych@@ ic missions .
&quot; her prosper@@ ous partner finally managed to convince them , that they were worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as indicators in the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a process against its former partners who developed into an in@@ scr@@ utable legal struggle between Paraguay and her homeland , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paraguay law : good approach to def@@ ective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not being applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of failure is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN @-@ Organization for Women in Paraguay . also sees big problems in the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Parliament was a bill introduced in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Parliament , which became known among the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Für@@ th ) . &quot;
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Dis@@ pos@@ e@@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
&quot; the original design of the law looks before , Fem@@ ale has to explain to a peculi@@ ar off@@ ense and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia is the case . &quot;
&quot; thus , the legislative text in some points was changed to also gain the Members for the Law , who fear@@ ed that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of Ab@@ t@@ led@@ ges , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay , and will be pun@@ ished up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill introduced , the majority of the ( bureau@@ cratic and economic ) procedure , who need to wear the victims of violence at present , if they simply provide an indication and want to receive a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law does not effectively be , if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial resources for it : &quot;
in Paraguay is being seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking is to take place that violence is no longer considered as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who determines in the light of these facts , makes me guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
we have to refund as long as Mis@@ cell@@ aring no more than normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Sen@@ at was adopted . previously , parts of the law had been altered . in addition , part of the law had been altered among others , the partners in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
the opinions about the changes have to deal apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor its victims again .
&quot; the declar@@ ations of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law does not apply as a major attack . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continues to attack a newspaper ban to ban a newspaper
&quot; this website was blocked because of a resolution of the Minister of the Information Minister , &quot; on the homepage of the Forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspapers Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he was an old @-@ old sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed before trial , but later they came back . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 von Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid rules , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , abol@@ ished by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; since then , he dres@@ sed , beside his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Minister Minister , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , Minister of the Supreme Council of Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sult@@ an is characterized by the observ@@ able efforts by the security forces , particularly of domestic secrecy , including freedom of freedom , including freedom of freedom , to restrict and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activi@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hin@@ ders citizens , also activi@@ sts , remember , their views on the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closing and the det@@ ention three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation 2007 on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , firmly established after the paper on 26 July 2016 . in it it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report the government promised , judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man under pressure have set pressure , a judgment in a inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 , with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind the hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i was arrested , Member of the Board of Directors , from the ISS before the special department and upon arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS awarded the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had acts as a Editor @-@ in @-@ editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; the paper was closed on in@@ definite period , after the information was given the instruction that &quot; the publication and spread of the paper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to j@@ ail and board the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned for the disorder of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; submission of the pres@@ tige of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Al @-@ Ha@@ j has been inv@@ ented in violation of an audience &apos;s injury and cul@@ p@@ ulation for guilty .
Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and wall@@ et at the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
&quot; Al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a money in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after completing the use of a information network to spread the material that could be a threat to the public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a deposit was arrested in height of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) , and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment announced on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court spoke Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i to six months in prison . &quot;
Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after the imprisonment of his sixth sentence in Mas@@ kat . Al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison for his sentence .
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court also lifted up the decision of the Ministry of Information , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n re@@ mit , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the information was issued a statement , with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information was sub@@ contrac@@ ted to personally another statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the ministers introduced another time against the decision of the appeal , the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the permanent closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press has been viol@@ ated in O@@ man .
&quot; for further violations include the closing of the website of independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the organizers of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the comprehensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
&quot; 2 . create a secure environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can go down their work ; &quot;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the countryside and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in O@@ man can imp@@ ose its right@@ ful human rights work un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted and without fear of inheritance schemes , including the judicial process . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ under@@ standings
Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ ri@@ ans in 2016 in Zambia and occurs with his permission
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for local research , there are two reasons : to offer a lack of medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria in the poorest countries of Africa have much more serious consequences than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical firms are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , to build their own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ er is Director of the Centre for the research of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially as the AIDS epidem@@ ic first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania resear@@ ched itself on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Au@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ under@@ standings of the media about these research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. war@@ er speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ er R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the use of research results . I support the sam@@ pled national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I have just got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
Q : what are your opinion about the important current academic topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there is no basic research here . we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always be recip@@ ients instead of being creators . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get , are often in our surroundings not well used , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it adequate ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or do here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have in advance ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there are interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of the space , the health care ( not transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from them . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; r@@ w : often , there are the limited speed , things to do , and the basic access to scientific expertise , which represent here challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines make articles only available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of availability and speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; -@@ seed producers will change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been bre@@ d in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant that cultivated by NASA A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space @-@ space and consumed . &quot;
&quot; for nearly 20 years , Mor@@ tons of work was only given by its own un@@ preced@@ ence and the question of how many sal@@ ads can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use it further . &quot;
&quot; the patents g@@ athers not only for individual sorts , but also for certain properties as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the last few years more , more such patents have been registered on more plants such as cer@@ eals or cardboard boxes . due to this trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alist and expert for food security in the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition breed with Mor@@ ton and still salad , he now needs much longer because his work is getting more and more and more still further . &quot;
&quot; it is , as would lie in a river a rock bro@@ ck , in order to get the p@@ ump@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; so we must do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; says . &quot; I think that these patents go on sal@@ ads too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stick to the court , no one can get more a new sal@@ ads , because all the characteristics are patented . therefore , it makes as good as possible and tried to raise those features which he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .

&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather sounds , when the movement comes from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , the alternatives to copyrighted software available . &quot;
&quot; she was launched in life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not being protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant bree@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , in short Ossi , the US @-@ bree@@ ders can commit to that other of them bre@@ eds seed free of them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and they can only sell them . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder only allow others to breed for so own varieties , and it &apos;s not immediately out@@ sour@@ ced - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant pat@@ ente or prescribed by law . &quot;
do@@ z@@ ens of bre@@ eder bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ing prospects
&quot; Professor Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , Professor Klo@@ pp@@ enburg appointed member of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Ossi @-@ Chief Executive Officer Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would attempt to use the latter or only little by creating seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stressed that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ ds , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to our aim of organic farming , &quot; he says and takes care of the increasingly frequent f@@ usions of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , should also know that the way it is bre@@ d for instance , such as this vegetables is bre@@ d , is threatened . &quot;
&quot; nutri@@ ent without seed , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to providing others their seed to others , so that their approach is in contrast to the use of seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; Ossi supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies is endangered , because the available pool is always available due to the increasing intellectual property rights on the plant material , which thus always restricted to shr@@ inking . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of Ossi , has engaged in her PhD @-@ thesis with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all boxes are being protected as intellectual property , making it used for plant breeding either at all or only difficult . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are not such estimates yet not , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ aging cultivated plants such as wheat in a larger scale are patented as salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are so bre@@ d that they have targeted characteristics - from those who improved their taste or color up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in particular environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders are increasing through ever more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Interphone Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ res and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture set up the company for the conservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradi@@ c@@ tory , however , the view to promote intellectual property other bree@@ ders , since &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent exp@@ ires . &quot;
&quot; often , these instructions are helping others to get to the same result . &quot;
such protection inhi@@ bits innovation not but promotes them by providing the public more material and know @-@ how .
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees the other : 20 years to wait , until a patent strap , there is certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you are waiting for a long time to grow in plants that have been adapted to the modified environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is however , that genetic resources have always been a general public and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ eti@@ qu@@ incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want to make farmers their job easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be made impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton is bot@@ her@@ ed by the concept of itself , plant characteristics : &quot; we create the characteristics not really itself . &quot;
the plants make them themselves off and as bree@@ ders we finally have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant @-@ intim@@ i@@ dation in the US state Oregon and Ossi @-@ manager , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ d a sor@@ row , ch@@ ur@@ izes its own values in it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ al , for whose cultivation of mass@@ acres are bre@@ d in his varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly un@@ fold . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are on international markets , but smaller than such as mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed enterprises to survive , even without patents , or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant l@@ igh@@ ter Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his Zu@@ cht@@ garten Sal@@ ads .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bree@@ ders would benefit by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ ents : &quot; it looks like me with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies , the patent . &quot;
&quot; I need to constantly monitor new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will be selling my varieties in a couple of years ago , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; with a patent one is protected from competition for 20 years with my opinion . &quot;
&quot; although the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; breeding , but the concept was rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open source programme . &quot; to preserve the seed of traditional farm varieties , the Centre is working with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license which ultimately , an formal and legally binding form of the Ossi @-@ obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country where the Ossi obligation cannot simply become one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants are not pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , she speaks against the present practice of the European patent and allowed patents on conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is still not a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States , the Patent@@ Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; Programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems explains that the organisation is currently a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed systems built , for the planned next year of the official start @-@ down . &quot;
&quot; a merger from environmental protection and developing countries ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to Sa@@ at@@ well and Bi@@ odiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the future of Food - a Verb@@ und from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published . in it represents the view that farmers have to come to seed , to exchange and improve the seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphasises the importance of a mani@@ fold , local supply with seed good for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Lu@@ by of Ossi hopes that it will soon be recognized by more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly respected where and how is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role as Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make the human being clear that even more behind their food is . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest objectives of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
even more is the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
&quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian Government of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documented human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August published the network an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ise the Egyptian authorities for this step , and said to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information , despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , whom the law had never been easier to cover the expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so difficult to overcome the blo@@ cking and not to med@@ itate on it . we ins@@ ist to fulfill our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first c@@ ens@@ ed website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities det@@ ained more than two months of 21 websites , as e.g. the independent German @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar &apos;s bol@@ ting network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era because of the &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web@@ pages for victims fallen . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ D@@ S@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , there is also no access to the blog of the Colom@@ ni@@ sts and human rights , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles , which he is not available in Egypt @-@ based websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , the he entered , to handle the ens@@ ored appar@@ itions of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blog@@ gers , the provider of which also Zi@@ adas blog is native , on the other hand is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo of photo , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , having been arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he reported on the Student@@ en@@ prot@@ est and a video recorded , like the police physical violence against two students . &quot;
its articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada is expressed by the blo@@ cking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the , blogs to sper@@ ren is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blo@@ cking of blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a reward ; one ar@@ rest , a attempted ass@@ ment at the national Security Council , the blo@@ cking blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I am not in vain . in other words : my words have influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first I used it to the post of articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
&quot; however , after they have been locked and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the fold leads the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ in and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this takes technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the blo@@ cking of vend@@ ors , due to uph@@ e@@ av@@ ement of intern@@ et@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how to offer the blo@@ cking of websites to the V@@ PN@@ s . &quot;
&quot; such practice points to the intention of the government to block content and filtering , to which the Egyptian users could have access . &quot;
&quot; the situation will in addition be wast@@ ed that the ens@@ ored decisions are hit behind closed doors , which the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using the court proceedings against these actions . &quot;
now the question : how far is the Egyptian government to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are dispute .

day for day newspapers in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post @-@ card mot@@ ive . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old school in school , &quot; &quot; every second day is mur@@ dered a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe rau@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the Army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the int@@ eg@@ tw@@ elle 2017 reached the highest level in Rio since 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian government organization Global Justice has even called the United Nations to access .
&quot; however , reports like these are daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; you will find at least the managers of a local newspaper . &quot;
&quot; for detailed reporting about violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the editorial article &quot; This is not normal &quot; , &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; war in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world happen as murder , pre@@ y , sex , etc . all , what happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not ex@@ clude our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of the newspaper , that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war in a country which does not recognise the war on at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the paper explains that it is subject to details of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the editorial article the newspaper writes on :
&quot; deliber@@ ately is aware that a war is dis@@ course , if it is distor@@ ted , also to be used , atro@@ cities of the police , who just sho@@ ots and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than they used ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil arg@@ um@@ ented the journ@@ alistic Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , to call the violence as &quot; war &quot; . &quot; this is their opinion based on justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could help to account responsibilities with the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated by the evaluation of the military activities in Rio itself - in combination with un@@ insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleas@@ ing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
to memory : the State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro is a &quot; &quot; non@@ violent place in Brazil &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . this is the most recent data . &quot;
none of these cities is in the State of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the mor@@ nings per state , Rio to No. 16 , &quot; writes them . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the company Glo@@ bo , the largest media company of South America , which has been stressed the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also belon@@ ged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to con@@ quer a massive police offer a Fav@@ ela and to create a unity permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease in de@@ ed deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP was actually protected after several reports of Sch@@ ik@@ ans and repres@@ sions against poor congreg@@ ations that should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of its articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not correspond to the - through the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws massive consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this is demanding the state on the means and ways to use the typical of a war . this is the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; with which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and for the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; ver@@ ir@@ te spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
one week it is now that police with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ l@@ zin@@ ho er@@ kl@@ om@@ m to betra@@ yed the death of a polic@@ emen .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence also this incident made : an orch@@ ard died as a result of shots , which made the police out of a hel@@ icopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Sy@@ rer to learn mushrooms

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brut@@ al Bel@@ ag@@ ation and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loy@@ alist troops . &quot;
&quot; according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation pax and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and De@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of Bel@@ ag@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; particularly strongly affected is the region east of Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 2013 has called the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the mass@@ ac@@ re of Assad has been exercis@@ ed by Assad &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , those of reb@@ els controlled areas outside of Damascus have been st@@ aff@@ led by Damascus at Bel@@ ag@@ ation , which resulted in local people , or through tun@@ nels and control points of lubric@@ ated foods . &quot;
due to the years of block@@ ade traditional foods such as meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
&quot; as a return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ ten@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the conventional , in Syria planted foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Skip to the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate the cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for this project for three years , and impressive his relief that it is now gaining more and more &quot; to famili@@ arity . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , n@@ ut@@ ze in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge of the pl@@ anting of fung@@ us , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of its expected target by approximately 12.@@ 700 € , but will be able to collect donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which maintain the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of the fuel c@@ app@@ eness are used locally made fuel from plastic , to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of the &quot; &quot; Pil@@ z@@ est &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and if it is suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , they planted a small mushrooms in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; teacher @-@ harvest for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they are distributed mushrooms all over the east of Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach people the pilgrims from various reasons , &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ch of Bel@@ ag@@ ation &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Portuguese for justice for the victims of the Bre@@ asts of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district cities in Portugal and called for justice for victims of fires that appeared in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
&quot; two and forty people died , and approximately 70 were wo@@ unded as a result of forest fires from the 15th and 16th of October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of State . &quot;
fires were also registered in the G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it appreci@@ ates that there were more than 500 fire@@ qu@@ arri@@ es that spread themselves in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and around 250 million acres of woods and numerous villages reached .
&quot; in June , Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande had a similar tragedy where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European fores@@ try system that monitors the forest areas with satellite recordings , alone 2017 in Portugal about 500,000 acres of forest burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is only in 4 districts of no fire .

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the call for better pre@@ matur@@ ely and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to compens@@ ate the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al by the Bund der farmers declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after the Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were evac@@ u@@ ated for everything and nothing .
&quot; this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are du@@ tz@@ end@@ ers reports of open streets , which were enclosed by fire . &quot;
in the forest of Lei@@ ria would have been able to happen a similar tragedy as in June as the streets were locked very late .
&quot; furthermore , construction conc@@ eptions are ques@@ tioned in Ö@@ rt@@ vities with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a broad proposal for the whale @-@ form , which had brought the government to serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was agreed by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led an attrac@@ ting of the law which had the wick@@ edness of case to fall , if the applic@@ ant has had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open outlet , so João Sor@@ val is further built in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made aware that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of slightly fl@@ amm@@ able wood , like in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ im , according to fires of this species continues to spread . &quot;
&quot; these issues come to these issues , that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , as inhabitants studied or tried to contact persons , offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that includes the population with information : they used the own civil@@ isation data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt , and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched by the developer of João P@@ ina in 2015 to simplify the work of Fire bri@@ g@@ ade , and this fat@@ eful weekend in October was so decisive that the lo@@ dges used , did not stand the website more than half a million attacks . &quot;

the path from the refuge@@ e from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

in one night in the fall of 1994 the Con@@ quest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
&quot; two years ago , a terrible civil war had broken between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had defe@@ ated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a land of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; just at this time , A@@ shar@@ f Bar@@ ati , one 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , which belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central America for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say it at that time , she didn &apos;t know that she would no longer see her Son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
dawn should break the boy in the morning .
his un@@ cle would fetch it and bring him to the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari who domin@@ ates the leader of Haz@@ ara of He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat was just mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara had suddenly felt un@@ condi@@ tionally .
the Taliban for their hat@@ red on the Minn@@ ville @-@ known Taliban were getting closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape the A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years in a cohesion . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took that which was left by his little sal@@ ary , and went in Iran . again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and sl@@ ed sacks with mur@@ der@@ ers who were harder than he himself to make himself his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of the refugees in Iran was characterised by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , I remembered A@@ shar@@ f in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ ans refugees ) lived in a quiet building on the job@@ site , on which we worked too . &quot;
&quot; there was no services and no heating . we handed n@@ ylon sl@@ ing in front of the open windows , so that we were not rede@@ emed at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af made his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
&quot; during the dangerous crossing in the sea , he suffered the ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ and@@ ete on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ f 2002 came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was as@@ le@@ af homeless , went alone through the streets of Rome , slept in the parks and went to a church that shared twice a day food to need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is due to relatively high ir@@ ill@@ ing@@ quot@@ as it is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . it is also true that the conditions that will find asylum seek@@ ers in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the United Nations Human Rights Committee for Europe writes , the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommo@@ dated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be divided into an insurrection centre if they officially asked a request for asylum - which can still be drawn on the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , either reli@@ ant on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it is also A@@ shar@@ f .
&quot; however , his unbeliev@@ ably living @-@ life helped A@@ shar@@ f , coming soon from these conditions soon . &quot;
&quot; after spending several years of work in building materials , A@@ shar@@ f had put his whole savings into the creation of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while and opened a bl@@ iss .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ f Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentation &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min W@@ ah@@ id@@ i . &quot;
the film was awarded the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afghanistan in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of the Afgh@@ an companies , including sl@@ ams , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ ans restaurants have even pra@@ ised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iter and kitchen staff largely refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurants of the restaurant relates to the various Afgh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek courts , the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ an .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ p@@ s goals range however far beyond the Italian Gastronom@@ y , and the retail trade and aims to leave back to the country which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ f with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happ@@ ily when I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
&quot; they represent half of society , and have to get the same possibilities as anyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ f also for@@ ged plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ atives in which people sell their harvest and improve their financial situation . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end , stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ f has made this trip itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; tizen &apos;s report : legislative decre@@ es from Egypt allow shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , has been in cu@@ sto@@ dy for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the replacement of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s report is an international snapshot , the challenges , vic@@ tories and upcoming trends in global Internet right shows
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a draft law , which provides that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a governmental authority . &quot;
users have to use in order to use social networks within six months after the successful law report on the website of the authority under specification of its full name as well as its publication number .
whoever talks this step could be sentenced to six months in order to be sentenced to six months or the removal of a prosec@@ ution .
&quot; the law , which was accepted by six@@ ty parliament@@ arians , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; May , another member of the vote would be introduced , in which harder pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the president or of a high officials would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under the Egyptian right , the ins@@ ult@@ ation of the president and government institutions are already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the law , such an act would be pl@@ edged to pris@@ ons and money @-@ pen@@ alties , such as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean until three years of imprisonment for the distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated violence against prot@@ esters , fought against the military put@@ sch , which led to the elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited , as much more as 700 protest participants had been determined by the same incident , four years in cu@@ sto@@ dy on a court . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the pris@@ ons of human rights groups went on to bring the acc@@ used of prison to the Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so are many human rights groups united , head@@ load of among other tru@@ ths , illeg@@ ally assembly , murder and tried . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court spoke in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage on the per @-@ Mor@@ si session block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ st@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activi@@ sts to sear@@ ched documents
&quot; May , Tunis@@ ian authorities six hours with the trial of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of independent media platform N@@ awa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been derived mainly to a sear@@ ched action plan . occupied plan was explicitly supported by the President of the Republic , according to the plan , explicitly , the busin@@ ess@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator officials Am@@ nest@@ y , provided that these all un@@ law@@ ful funds will be returned . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of N@@ awa@@ at published document , thro@@ ws a light on how the pre@@ valent plans to support the law@@ suit was . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia squee@@ zed the incl@@ ination of its sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press ko@@ dex@@ es , which journalists have the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to present their credit card ?
&quot; according to new rules of information offices of the Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need to write or share social media in China before they write messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration will also indicate that the registration with the full re@@ bel name will be required . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st suppose that by the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks should be achieved . it is now un@@ clear , as the authorities apply these rules . &quot;
&quot; Chinese Network citizens have proposed the social media to achieve these provisions only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
then we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat . &quot; ?

&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or vers@@ y We@@ Chat , to register at the state government as &quot; organizer of information &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government takes a list of online services that allow the &quot; &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the law allows the government to assume responsibility for removing content and to force them on request for sending user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently owned websites like v@@ contacted and Od@@ no@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russian two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the E @-@ Mail @-@ service Mail@@ .ru and du@@ tz@@ el of other services . &quot;
