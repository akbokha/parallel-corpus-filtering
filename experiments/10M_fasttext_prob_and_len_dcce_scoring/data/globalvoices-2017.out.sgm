<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally large.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, played American music dancing, American authors and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly on account of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Studying, which was the top federal court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," me, "it was, as if that is the absolute truth, do everything else that is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you are always that you are, and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his Engdies.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never keeps his mind behind the mountain as you have so beautiful says.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of a former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latrous and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people have responded to his statements and voted in scars for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won at the republicans elections, was the highest number one likely to nominate one of the party nominate candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigest person, I asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters to get into harmony with people during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist program, which people from all over the world is taking a deep a deep man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also Trumps universe is not associated with the by Peter Bhatia, the current Editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix "" to watch the game. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I lived at Sandy Bahr, who fought for the environment and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she also fits her to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with a lot of patience and grace and helped me to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them embodied values of deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump extends its way to nominate republics of presidential, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly consecrate, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps straight on because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the examination of the idea that people voted for Trump, because they had either his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, burst almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair the Trump-voters as reassists to describe.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange the people, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in another way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their churches are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most of them are, for Trump tuned, because they want to regain control over a country which she disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, you can hardly forget the words of David Remcro, who commits the cruel decision to raise a man who looks different with contempt to those who look different from it."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(m.).: as much as" elongation of the whites against all other ethnies "; wordplay from white in touch on the whites and whiplash, which means as much does the great Van Jones Named, has just killed what America has done so great."</seg>

<seg id="43">"for this country is elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyianers, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but the choice of Donald Trumps, however, is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again on the ruin, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all that I have to think of Khizr Khan must, the father of a soldier who is fallen in Iraq, and what he said at the eve of the election."</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that specifically reported about international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release happens in the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already operated in liberal waters illegal fishing, before it was the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were thus far-brought and little gendered to welcome a legislative breaker of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique, and the Seychelles is mobilized rapidly against the ship. they denied him to share one of their ports and consecusted him to share a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "Ursuddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply reminded everything, Benedict Kiilu, a leitner of the Kenyan fishery Authority. he is part of a team who discovered the ship of the ship and followed it."</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminality practices, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing) was founded."</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which then had driven the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "" says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is imprisoned, it is hidden because it is extremely difficult to uplift it. this makes illegal fishing a main object of overfishing from regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the deliberate abuse of existing laws, through which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can cause a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, while actions against illegal fishing was formerly hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail, with the information between individual countries, so that the actions nowadays happen in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"the individual countries can exchange with each other, e.g. lists of existing licenses, to suspected news or details that you noticed during a port inspections."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when it move around the open sea, through satellite."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships which are fishing in verbotaned areas - about such that indicate that a ship invites its tiled fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the idealment such surveys can show such investigations whether the participating ships have a fish stocks, where they were travelling and possibly also whether they have a pening register."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries which are against illegal fishing, can be found on the basis of this information then refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports. and that they might not be forced to sell their charge of penalties, as in the case of the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that the illegal fishing is not worthwhile itself."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that's what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, leitner director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company which is involved in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported by FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed Front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the previously mentioned platform was created to recovered 20 million USD to lost sales, which lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen that penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing, present for commercial fishing from around the world. among these also those illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"to these practices include actions as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licensing, specification of fantasiename, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature conservation."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they are targeted the lack of international co-operation and make the weaknesses of a not completely organised control system, "" says Long. "" it was able to say a ship illegal and a country could then say "You daring my port."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Komm to me'. 'and precisely this legale Schlupfloch tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has uncovered criminal networks in Tanzania, the fake licenses used in Tanzania. it discovered ships that have several fraudulent identities and it has deplated ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with Interpol, the International Authority on the fight against crime, FISH-i information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us rather far into the networks of organised crime, "" says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that is to help the FISH-i to grasp digest ships precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's Satellite system, which is always developed further, also helps to hide illegal ships who like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position," "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships also switch off their automatic identification systems which can no longer be saved by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps therefore to build a system, which connects different information levels with each other. it shall help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently SkyTruth has recently opened its platform Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite channels and can be displayed with the position of every single verable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of who, where does - this results simply meaning, "" says he. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for research. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, in which a global system allows tracking ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but also crying."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that earlier without license confectionate and hardly to reckon with consequences we know that they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i has now participating a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats are more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had put Greko 1 ascending, found the inspections there on board towing, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"also other countries also notice this success." "the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries", "says Kiilu." "we are a course object." "in West Africa every year will disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, 2015 six countries have joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With safety is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest members of Somalia announce his first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the way under false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used towing, which now is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also taken in verbotene waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1 set the a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea. Emma Bryce is free professional journals and lives in London. there they writes about environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for passing, one needs two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the starting-text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in case of native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother tongue."</seg>
<seg id="379">Such a French mother language should translate into French for example from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese businesses do not employ workers with English as a native language, translation into English. this may be due to fault of understanding, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers, to learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies who do not have any foreign employees, cause translations of company internally. then the Japanese employee who made English knowledge as the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrally and mysterious propositions which arise by machine translation, reveal that this technique may not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to several languages especially."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious usselfish prints, which often uses T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood not at all."</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture of Miyagi was a fine prefecture in Japan, that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the Neighbours of Fukushima and Iwate have been implied because the tsunami had to disappear all the coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, the prefecture of Fukushima had a nuclear accident, even alone it had to leave 160 000 inhabitants left their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows that progress six years after that progress has been reached in order to rebuild the life of local resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese reforming authority and survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that until December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (for example, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures was able to record Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned spare parts have been completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima with 70 percent of the final light forms."</seg>
<seg id="554">"nevertheless, one still strives, even six years after the disaster, evacuated by Behavira juutaku) in final spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shelving accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, still 36 000 people from Miyagi still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such shortcomings."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 per cent of the year 2011 evacuated from Fukushima still live more than 75 per cent of the evacuated, which became more than 75 per cent of the evacuated accommodation, were converted into final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwata the number is at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"how the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung was able to establish 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by unhappiness until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of schools of three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"during almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi now back in operation, we have resumed their operations in Fukushima just 30 percent of the fishery."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the atomic accident, have moved to the three prefectures of agricultural land-scale cultivation in Mitpassion."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agre land in Fukushima again."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic incident, as only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed Ackermann of Fukushima, are located in the" nuclearing system zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima far downcast."</seg>

<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reported that since the disaster has almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it seems more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"to determine a general picture, the paper led numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacuated by. they asked them about the state of re-construction and also how their sensation has changed over the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper:</seg>

<seg id="575">As it comes to those who had to evacuate from the Prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In her edition to the anniversary of the strawberry the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the position of the evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima did not only have to experience the huge earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, catastrophic, atomic facts, the Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, there were more than 23 000 people, returned to Fukushima, in lasting spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home-prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuated regions are most of the evacuated presses, older than 50 years old. they need to compete in correct construction projects, because the efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games to take place in Tokyo."</seg>

<seg id="692">"youth of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with themes which are important for them. they do so by means of Hip Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N 'we Jinan-Tour, bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centers, to promote youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges who lives in Montreal and then worked in Nord-Quebec with ten Cree-Communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars together.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is increasing that the young participants in talks such as" cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-unacceptable "or what they can always come into mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. federal state Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia relates for example the history of highway 16, also" highway of tears, "at which almost two dozen of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unresolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motive of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people of the First Nations are not always broken."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagooi Cree First nation is recorded, the refrain on Cree is sung."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people took some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop group that gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the facebook page from N 'we Jinan is available the Strophe into inscription, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if no one would ever be interested in myself</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth for my days</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports in- and foreign media over the infamous" fight against drug trading "in Mexico, the missing and gearboxes regularly emerge only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy against this struggle with itself."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the reporting of drug bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the Chief of Sinaloa-Kartell, the stories of the victims of the conflict is totally in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, there is hardly anyone looking at the trauma or to the congregations that have learned to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every corpse, behind every bone marbles in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of loose parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds perhaps never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico holds the digital project" "Aprenda Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "with the drug dealers'), which aims to give such sacrifices and stories of people who spoke in the struggle between prosecution authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime makes us not just fear of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug retailers and all congregations are therefore many kilometers to buy something like milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "like fear life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>

<seg id="772">Where should we get the cause? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid of that. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the government."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in Hochrisiko areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a lesbian of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central mexiko."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>

<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel the feeling, as if I am the one that is contented or sad. it works, like a lack of respect towards the person who was once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be equal or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year old cousin thinks that he wants to be Narco (German: drug dealers) if it is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroism "of the penises when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me this is, as if they were those who have lost someone, and those who have fear that they have something happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to mere figures become in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the inaction of humans is unbelievably for me, if the death of six people and the couraging of 43 students are justified in a neighbour, that they were" cherished. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to talk that they remain unaffected by such tragedies if they are not stirred up and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico-town has written the post" Four months blackmailing in the main square: how a family moved with threats. in it, she describes how armed criminals month for the month money from their business, until they had not only destroyed the business but also their families apart.

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega released the post "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of violence initiated.</seg>

<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are unimportant in comparison to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">"but this was not the day, where his childhood ended."</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has been over two years ago when he was just a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father saw, who had been shot by armed men from a pre-driven car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born as bryan, the situation in JuÃ¡rez saw the situation in JuÃ¡rez:"</seg>

<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that can be deposited in Mexico in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>

<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" has launched the data journalism project Narco, whose aim is to put the complex information behind the failed fight against drug dealers, which has tortured the country in the last four decades, in an understandable way.

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to enter here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the creation of stories in their original language is a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported above briefly about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the imreplacable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written report, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite such small languages will not be passed on to the children."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we can create cities, the diversity - safe spaces, in which inhabitants do not have to mention who they are to be related."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"often listening to this is often associated to understand" "How these events instead" "listen to estimate, to feel,"</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format the story told their story in their own language before and translate them into English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not professional tastes, their devotion and their representation is that the audiences are on it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laugh and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the Gift of Rassidatou is also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narralled art."</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well known sociale network took their post from the net because it enthused the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although about the origin of the word still is discussed, it is usually used to refer to people's indiindian origin or generally used as additives."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook zensored the word" "Kalar" "or the other of the other (in burmesa font) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radial nationalist movements were given to the word an extremely valuable connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has a lot of sensual content on his platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism but the word itself is not automatically given by Hassan.</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that post, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in its use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several burmesic words with basic different meanings that have the same letter like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair at Burmese also called 'Kalar htaing' written, which contains the same letters, as well as other words as' Kalar PAE '(woody),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' calarctic '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookdiger Aung Kaat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">"a post of one of my friends has been deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on a spiritual way, whether they were awake, how he can leathers his back pain, by doing a word play."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" healing "(la) to Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hats is the opinion that they will reduce the Hassan radically nationalists, but also that Facebook analytic cists before it all the posts solder, which in the suspicion of racial, racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filter the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you are doing on facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do, is the post carefully analyze and control it by checking the side words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar PAE "(alternating)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-class nationalists spread, spread the Hassan, a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcised its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all, the Hassan address, may not stop the efficiency of this strategy for long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords are often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or alternative writing of the tender word to express their views."</seg>

<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new Directive of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and told me the Like, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post office has not been corresponded to the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">"Facebook has removed a variety of Posts of people who have no negative intentions, or simply try to show their opinions against the Hassan" nationalists "nationalists."</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with Hassan:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion about why extremimer nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention, racism in Burma by their platform, but so it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to zenseren will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>

<seg id="1326">"if they had only something more respect for the 15 million health benefits, that would describe them a great sales, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make use of Facebook funny and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hassan, to see if their Posts are taken from the net."</seg>

<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs which there is in 13 Indian States, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas worked for seven years with the help of their video camera in the discovery of practices, such as children's rat up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and guides these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports on how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they are at the same time taken them in the throes of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion, was written by women who did not name her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about Patriarchate with a problem where women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the name of her husband is not noisy, a breeze is also maintained and never put into question."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman wants her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not keep this, is regarded as being deposited as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted in that we have never thought of these discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who has never seen her husband before, at home, trying to try out how it works."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-mother and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"internash, my husband, turned to me and said, I solves him from now on at his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self confidence in the luggage launched Rohini started its first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the videoprojection women tried to bring discussion with a exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant in, the name of her husband with various feelings to say - happy, verannoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then they asked all," If we cannot tell the name of our husband, but they can call us how they want it, means that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husband about the lips," says Rohini Pahe, from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Brechen of a century-old tradition, in the married women the name of her husband. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise just before himself, a different decided to settle the whole anilted frustration against him and his family by passing it away."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenalin with an ancient braking, the women decided that they would actually try to name her husband at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband called a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head, and his wife could not stop his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another servant-member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"her mother-in-law she died, she got fear and said that there was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said, I solves it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband a husband in was less comprehension and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of galvanic red dot on the forehead, which indicates the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the galvanic red spot, if he also works."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to it to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not come complete with it, but my, they are now in a better position, even to choose him in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip with each discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I do not want to worry that the women could make sure that what could hear," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays into their own birthdays with cakes; they auditioned and spoke about things that they never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands, have never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they are at one."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been worn only Saris.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it is okay, but some wanted a salar-spa, a broad Shirt of a hose, carry; they have not dreamed."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of war and discussion about the advantages of your own closets, morals associated with the Saris and much more, tasted Rohini her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemder) into a discussion, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they decided now to plan a trip to Goa, where they can carry jeans and Rohini is certain that they will be able to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the question, whether in the five months has been changed since their first discussion, Rohini confirms that things slowly get into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times but then listened to the name of her husband's husband to say.</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, included me, make it still, but only when they are alone and no other family members are doing so."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of her husband; only one or two women now contribute at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the discussion, know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the cheering for more freedom of movement or its own closets - at the end of a hard to navigating river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"as they give each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"but this club, each of us gives us confidence that will change something."</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home and tell other people about what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">"the correspondents of the video Volunteers community come out of marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories, about which is not reported."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may be stupid, since Singapore is recognised on an international level as an independent state."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam should be seen in Singapore as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international subsidiary of the State Chamber of New York, the Minister, that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because Singapore is compared to other countries."</seg>

<seg id="1696">"it was like vulgar, it had the semblance of a escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory violation."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons of Shanmugam mentioned reasons were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of which he appeared to unditably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore was compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanent from a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old suffering from the authoritarian feeders who will be predictate Democrats, leaving the twisted logic because they adapt better to their power."</seg>

<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to make his opinion clear since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>

<seg id="1710">Read the wording.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"as he said that Singapore rather a" city "is as a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore was so unequal, even if we look forward to free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He went to Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party).</seg>

<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment on Shanmugam, who is as a leader of a growing generation, such a polemic statement."</seg>

<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts, and I am not even sure whether he really believes it correctly and aware what he defends."</seg>

<seg id="2070">"my cries fell by him not enough, which is why they reexed the pipe by a cable."</seg>

<seg id="2077">"my half-snack body, the outstretched on the ground was the perfect electric conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must probably be so at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to lay myself again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours left, which came to me as minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the light meets the room" .Raus with you, Arschficker. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I responded with the voice of a exhaustible youths:" my Lord, my father must be feared. "</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be silent and run away, you will unswept."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always been released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the jordanic Rapper Emsallam Hdaib spoke about the rights of LGBTQ + -community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken from Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the bulk of his time; sometimes it sleded to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, to his computer and also to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what can be left to discover is a cigarette between his fingers or with nicotine stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he has lived in the top floor of his family house, which had joined them since 1967; the year, in which Israel was forced to flee his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which she had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years Hdaib is a passionate activist that faces the conservative majority and asks their old proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapids."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, often faced with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation in Palestinian refugees, but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world. all of these issues are not only available in his hometown Amman Relevance, but also in cities that have wealthy Damascus in Syria until Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is restricted in his mind, and he can feel according to their own statement by people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he is not open to the American foreign policy, there is a special inclination against the U.S. American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art at his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib believes that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas, something that he was born with his identity as" Palestinian-flee of the second generation "," even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own living conditions so," stresses hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so, because I am a man, while he shook in water nests in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan. at that time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanic law also involves that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand a cup of coffee on a sentimingly hot junk has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the clamping warm coffee and the swelling of the cent cigette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you throw a view into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"of this reason, one simply avoids to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ramadan waters - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the interior of Jordaniens has cancelled an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action of the Muslim Brotherhood - arguing that sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts of Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional standards of the country resisted and the main reason for the concert. "</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the members and former press conference in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahbb said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was" straight "because of the sexual orientation of the Sanger."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many claim, the commitment of the band's involvement in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world was more dangerous activism that constitutes the former legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila das jordana people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continues to stand for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely to be simply sainted rhetoric, but in fact reflected in a clear clear reality in Jordan that occurs in Hdaibs's plant clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib traditional sex experience at Leibe, by drawing his vision of the fate of Arab women, who have sex oral sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a obviously suppresated unfamiliar woman, their arms and legs up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, in Jordan, the number of" Honorary "Honorary" has increased - the inofficial outside. "</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch was estimated that the number of Honorary murder in 2016 reached their peak; however, Jordan is still scared that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried sacrificing victims or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for breaking control from the year 1954 women, who are exposed to the danger of internal family, and for their release is often an years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee on the part of the family, that the woman has nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Musik enjoys great popularity and is also known for it, nor to be returned to topics in his country as a tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib holds that his work is politically, however, however, that he is his music which is full of explicit acceptance of sexuality, freedom and expression, not of politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was put into politics," "says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are in the core politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words," what you want, "is it faith or non-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that there is hardly any person in Jordan over the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still strongly influenced in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib brought an interview for the popular jordana OnlineProgram Roya, to record later that his comments made out of the context, revolt, and his opinion had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a working version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires Hdaib open to the Arab LGBTQ + -community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not uncover the Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth, who still remained in mind thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat was to work once on behalf of the potassiops, in the eighth-century openly about homosexuality could write, why can Jordan do not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite kingdom, there is nothing new more that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are to be silent."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Austrian Intelligence service took a number of former government officials and members of the teacher association, with the reason, they would have voiced based on comments in social media, which coincided with the deep in the country rooting corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"given the concert of Hdaibs, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a continuous type of giving and taking off Jordan, Mashrou'Leila has now opened a performance for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - thus sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and incomparable changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the civil society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs also, of an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreams not only dreams of his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it, to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is involved with music, art and literature of a genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs, Streumunitions and in artificial way. at least, he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is far, Hdaib will continue and therefore resist resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report has been replaced by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting where Aman heard as a student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these large, extravagant warps are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas so that the solids, the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years were built in the armies of the west of Japan to force the Indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knee."</seg>

<seg id="2157">I saw myself for a long time the Meguro Gajoen: two forts are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only True - and to spend a breathtaking way of this summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel stolen, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question went to the two young Colombian activists, Leonardo PÃ¡rraga of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation (Letas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (Letters to reconciliation), the young people write to write guerrilla letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only in short, her country had a position of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the GuerillaMovement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Latin America), forms the shortcut of the longest conflict in Latin America."</seg>

<seg id="2189">"Guerrilla warps, who have lived for many years in illegal warehouses, and around the clock to have their weapons in their truction, must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, which had used to life in constant fear and in some cases deepened hatred against guerrilla wares, these now needs to record them in their ranks and support them in setting up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian would have to close together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this they did so: until now I have written thousands of young people letters - love message to former guerrilla to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla warfs that should be passed personally.</seg>

<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but letters of teaching people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can run in just a few hours - from fear through to happiness and everything, which in between is, "" told the politicians, Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra is a employee of the Governors of the Province of Valle del Cauca - this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>

<seg id="2211">"I spoke to him anyway and asked:" "hello, what do they do?" he answering said, "I responded to a letter that someone has written me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>

<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - Related, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightsad.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the required to return me to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they made absurd demands: some told me, I kisses it that I wanted them in the official TV in Grosny, saying that I had not changed my sex in the official TV, that everything was only flechtreach, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have baskets C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this printing?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older men said once my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," You have brought a monster to the world that not only has your family, but the entire Republic was ashamed. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we can not stir you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother was too much, and she placed a strick around the neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to switch the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later the window stood by car with darkens windows and a numeric shield with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Once it happened for the third time it was clear that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends check the numeric signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flown out?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons I will not say her name, but I will say that I remember them all, they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then a little unbelief."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering, without any reference, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I stuck the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you do not think about, you are warmer in security, just because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you steckst. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you looking for in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the gender equality, but this is a tapping topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements still trage I still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very I wish to also wish this spiritual barrier I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me trouble as the person watch out of which she remembers themselves from her past - so to my masculine form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed dorsal?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have made a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I find current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has to eat one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he completed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives before, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so called" honor "through blood Genughness."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also now truncated in these mysteries now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it would not be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then especially such that have no rich relatives or were dropped from their relatives to stand Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there, so that they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be rebrought, you will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked either your village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but rather submerged to radicalize themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only one mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I have just got someone who was detained one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown the beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was since then nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so called Lord, this person was even taken as these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"but until now, they were not presented as bandits, so there were no reports yet. we suppose that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not be allowed to shave it?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"know if these persecutions and abductions of people who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already very big when I still lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">At the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia initially wanted to bring us to the" "civilisation", "but finally he has thrown back into the stopover."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were dotted; I had colored eyelashes, carried Tubejeans and short Tops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the sharia of the sharia has never hung me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; she knew why men, young people, there met."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been victorious.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a reuse: Kharda ma Kharda. that is: "spotte not about the unhappiness of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"one often says to children, if who make himself fun with sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me never chased and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace be kept?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"as he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister, he began to speak on TV on morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us by se, but primarily on the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had formerly lived and yellowed, viewed you at once with Argisn."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"every time I came back home, I was able to feel how the situation in the Republic has been steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earned a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I still am active as an active player."</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I come unionere with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacups, meetings, I support her to hospital and help them to get Essentides."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">"I have discovered these people themselves, when I swept away."</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: enter a Hiddf?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is nature that has nothing to do with religion</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as the pinch, who want to turn to you with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no gay with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which the Kabaker have which, the Russians also have, and on all the planet it is - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, therefore it is unpleasant to listen."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I tread here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who walk into the mosque and during Ramadan they live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"know many think about Transidentity on men who love men, and they believe that you are going to make their sex to make more intimate experiences."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be accurate, different living settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I am here so personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large majority of Iran live in the Arab Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to ride their livelihood."</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, responding to many women - especially white women, who call themselves as an intersesectional feministers - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even place well thought of scientific and social arguments against me, why I should be feminist, and why we generally hear all feminist * inside."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays are still less money despite the same education as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"that women still stand under strict observation, when it is about what they are allowed to do with their body."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women gain earlier or later in various areas of life to a glass blanket, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I come to speak to skin colour, racism, black women in the LGBT-community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I have been considering what kind of we are physically and verbal, both in and outside the feminist movement, a lot of white feminists have to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, they agree that women - all women - come together to raise their voices and sing 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk, that in addition to sexualised violence gives an institutionalized form racist motivating violence that we are exposed to black women."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or above that black women and women of other ethnies and origin, less deserve as white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls are referred to with a migration background of the school as a white girl because of the visible integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want to join all the women, all the men and all people with no skin colour; on the other hand, I cannot consider myself as a black woman in whose center the white woman, who refuse to consider injustice in their mind, both on the gender and on the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and I will not fight any more to fight my belonging in a white feminist oriented Sphere, which always rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner accused 1851 in their speech:" "I am not a woman?" and I also weigh me to maintain an ideology, in which the black woman is a human being a human and marginalized being. "</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I weigh me to join me groupings, which also absorb through cultural exposure to our customs and customs, to advance to their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to set white women the importance of reasoning of skin colour and gender equality. for some of them continue to do the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to honor them by a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersesectional feminism was founded to give women of different income, and at the point of view from the white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to dissolve myself full of feminism and to connect me to the movement of the womanism that is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so stubbornly that intersedal phenomenon is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres, which are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves by asking ourselves on our own way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered that the black woman can do."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersesectional feminists are immediately called separatism and exclusion after they read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement which the black woman is concerned."</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed for the protection of the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a policeman said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they have nothing against Luis Balbuena, their exual partner who has become violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship was a bit of time passed and the police declared, their statement would be placed at the acts, but more could not do."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as a further Mrs. Balbuena due to Missions, it also showed the aktenant display of Ada BÃ¡ez."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the famine of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women gain once an ad, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases the women also depend on men dependent on men, which are misleading. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit, victims of violence should be reported at all at the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 loop and Statistics 2 Invisible Missions and a legal system that is nothing more than immt3 Paraguay. laws: good approach, deficient implementation of blows and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really misleading, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for pleasures on Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a socio-economic research institution in Paraguay." there are various information and reports, which however do not even procure the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the District Prosecution 9600 ads went on for domestic violence. at 70% of it, it went for violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace of peace. also here 86% of the ads have arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads said 40% of women, that they were physically breasted, 55% of women spoke of psychological missions."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan Women of Ana Baiardi, only a few of these offences are actually displayed in fact." "on every woman who will be reimbursed in Paraguay due to psychological missions, come 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"every woman who will be reimbursed to every woman, the two women who do not do this," stated at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's suicide in Paraguay is no own offence, the prosecution authorities cannot be adequately documented as many women are assassinated by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"only until August 2016, journalists have at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country alone."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"for the need for local research, there are two reasons: to offer a lack of medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa have much more serious consequences than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical firms are a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, to build their own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2601">Q: what are your opinion about the important current academic topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">Rw: there is no basic research here. we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always be recipients instead of being creators."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" -seed producers will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as outredness, the first plant that cultivated by NASA Astronauts in space-space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for nearly 20 years, Mortons of work was only given by its own unprecedence and the question of how many salads can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it further."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents gathers not only for individual sorts, but also for certain properties as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the last few years more, more such patents have been registered on more plants such as cereals or cardboard boxes. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalist and expert for food security in the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as passionate representatives of a millennia tradition breed with Morton and still salad, he now needs much longer because his work is getting more and more and more still further."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would lie in a river a rock brock, in order to get the pumped."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we must do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "says." I think that these patents go on salads too far. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stick to the court, no one can get more a new salads, because all the characteristics are patented. therefore, it makes as good as possible and tried to raise those features which he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space station ISS ISS red RÃ¶mersalat of the Sorted Outredgeous in the "conservatory" of the station was bred and eaten. there is tested whether plants in space can be cultivated.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather sounds, when the movement comes from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed initiative (initiative for" Open-Source "" seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, the alternatives to copyrighted software available. "</seg>
<seg id="2645">"she was launched in life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not being protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, in short Ossi, the US-breeders can commit to that other of them breeds seed free of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and they can only sell them." open source "breeder only allow others to breed for so own varieties, and it's not immediately outsourced - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant patente or prescribed by law."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scaffoling prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"Professor Kloppenburg, Professor Kloppenburg appointed member of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Chief Executive Officer Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter or only little by creating seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stressed that the "Open-Source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, cords, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to our aim of organic farming, "he says and takes care of the increasingly frequent fusions of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, should also know that the way it is bred for instance, such as this vegetables is bred, is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"nutrient without seed, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative are committed to providing others their seed to others, so that their approach is in contrast to the use of seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supplies is endangered, because the available pool is always available due to the increasing intellectual property rights on the plant material, which thus always restricted to shrinking."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD-thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all boxes are being protected as intellectual property, making it used for plant breeding either at all or only difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are not such estimates yet not, but experts like Luby suspect that massaging cultivated plants such as wheat in a larger scale are patented as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from those who improved their taste or color up to such, due to which they thrive in particular environments and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders are increasing through ever more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Interphone Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for monsantos activities. with a total of four genres and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture set up the company for the conservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradictory, however, the view to promote intellectual property other breeders, since" patents and protection of plant varietties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expires. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often, these instructions are helping others to get to the same result."</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection inhibits innovation not but promotes them by providing the public more material and know-how.</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait, until a patent strap, there is certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you are waiting for a long time to grow in plants that have been adapted to the modified environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is however, that genetic resources have always been a general public and continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetiquincentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be made impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton is bothered by the concept of itself, plant characteristics:" we create the characteristics not really itself. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make them themselves off and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant-intimidation in the US state Oregon and Ossi-manager, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding:" who bred a sorrow, churizes its own values in it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monocultural, for whose cultivation of massacres are bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly unfold. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are on international markets, but smaller than such as monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed enterprises to survive, even without patents, or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant lighter Frank Morton is looking for in his Zuchtgarten Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders would benefit by the Avoid of plant patents:" it looks like me with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies, the patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need to constantly monitor new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will be selling my varieties in a couple of years ago," says it. "" with a patent one is protected from competition for 20 years with my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seem to be a leader in the" "Open Source" "breeding, but the concept was rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ") which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, a" open source programme. "to preserve the seed of traditional farm varieties, the Centre is working with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" -seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an" open source "license which ultimately, an formal and legally binding form of the Ossi-obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country where the Ossi obligation cannot simply become one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants are not patentable. thus, she speaks against the present practice of the European patent and allowed patents on conventional plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is still not a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States, the PatentOffice to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "-seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the" Open Source "" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seed. "</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Programme for" Open Source "-seed systems explains that the organisation is currently a worldwide alliance for" open source "" seed systems built, for the planned next year of the official start-down. "</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger from environmental protection and developing countries (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to Saatwell and Biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the future of Food - a Verbund from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report published. in it represents the view that farmers have to come to seed, to exchange and improve the seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a manifold, local supply with seed good for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Luby of Ossi hopes that it will soon be recognized by more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly respected where and how is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role as Luby." we are now trying to make the human being clear that even more behind their food is. "</seg>

ANHRI has never been so difficult to overcome the blocking and not to meditate on it. we insist to fulfill our task further."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censed website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities detained more than two months of 21 websites, as e.g. the independent German-language edition of the Huffington Post and that from Qatar's bolting network of Al Jazeera because of the" support of terrorism "."

<seg id="2733">Its articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada is expressed by the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>

<seg id="2739">First I used it to the post of articles to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have been locked and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
