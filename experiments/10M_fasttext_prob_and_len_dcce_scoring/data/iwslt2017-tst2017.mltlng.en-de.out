this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize in the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
&quot; long before anyone had heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen One book , in which he looks spectacular that the N@@ SA took illeg@@ ally of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret co @-@ operation , where the CIA &quot; CIA &quot; literally b@@ lows for a nuclear bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if the lo@@ opy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not feel the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government has been determined on the edges and called it to name its inn@@ ate sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the patterns of the government , wh@@ ist@@ le @-@ wh@@ ist@@ le to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitu@@ tional Supplement , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ d . &quot;
&quot; thus , when the government has anch@@ ored , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ por@@ ters have already done before him , he ref@@ used and said that he would prefer to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived in prison with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days prior to the process , a something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they had been given for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped off . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ter and sources can always hide less .
&quot; rather than to fail and bring rise to the statements , which could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators have worried , without his consent , his telephone @-@ wise geh@@ eim , &quot;
&quot; just as his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers and risk of risk . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is just one of many cases . &quot;
President Obama spoke to his grace to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers . but instead the judiciary has sentenced more than all US governments in front of him .
&quot; now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government can become much of her work as geh@@ eim . &quot;
&quot; since the 11th of September , almost every article on national security was the result of such a wh@@ ist@@ le @-@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we are setting the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional referendum , because the government has ever more possibilities to play all out . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can contact them from the moment in which they contact , rather than in advance , in the stuff . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that it has not yet been written as r@@ isen , and it is much safer than regular e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source over@@ head system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers which was originally developed by the presence of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server where the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot store more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request , would not be available from pre @-@ start . &quot;
&quot; however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments all over the world develop new Sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ et@@ technologies that meet us all at risk . &quot;
&quot; it is to make sure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to exchange mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers . &quot;
&quot; the over ab@@ norm@@ alities in the care of soldiers hum@@ ble knows and reported by crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm on the ver@@ sion@@ ing water of Fl@@ int suggests . or a pilgrimage @-@ street , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data che@@ que has been hidden in history . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &apos; revealed that Rei@@ che and powers &#93; &#91; mean that &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; this week we were posted by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ s@@ ack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ s@@ ack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , such as the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands prime minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; also , there are reports that a composite of the brut@@ al dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad brief@@ ing firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin introduces , through a tight friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others give the nervous to the next release , and the next revealed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the P@@ lot of an agency or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ RO@@ MAN@@ S .
&quot; it seems we@@ pt away from you , to me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we handle what ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens , and not all pay its taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians , how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens will be used by some few to hide and wear -- something that we have been discussing and mis@@ cellaneous for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people this whole world will be very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens function . &quot;
I always imagine like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ d@@ oom .
&quot; thus , one has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there is fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably , because there were so far no prominent Americans who arrived in these revelations , this scan@@ dal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ s@@ ack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data base from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples which have connections to the United States . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states need less information to specify less information to create a company than to get a library . &quot;
this type of transparency in the US has allowed the employees of school @-@ circul@@ ating school children .
&quot; it has been allowed , especially vulnerable investors . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
&quot; here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to figure out how all this in practice looks . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; so , we sent a covered revival in the offices of 13 An@@ wal@@ ts@@ companies in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investigation gave himself as African ministers , who wanted to bring money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; it really is sho@@ cked it really , that all up to an attorney made by our investig@@ ator suggestions , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ hen@@ sions . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course , nobody was passed to money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as a single use .
&quot; it is not about a single attorney , who has sub@@ merged proposals to our res@@ c@@ apped proposals . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single top pole , involved in a scan@@ dal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we have to change the rules to d@@ are this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound all very little thing as if we could do anything against it , as if nothing could ever change ; as if it will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as born @-@ born , I really see that a lot has begun to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen pres@@ ences towards greater transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU is recorded in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not do the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama &apos;s revelations , that huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , as a means is used to provide more transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people that are angry , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the head@@ lamps . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy that stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians to realise the problem and use it , by laws to end this kind of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can end the in@@ transparent which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; a day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ seat . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and look my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and made just a road@@ trip throughout the country . after that he would go to peac@@ scor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you kill them tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing even worse , &quot; I do not know it . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what can I do now ? &quot;
who knows the situation not ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him again ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I will not kid@@ n@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have a bub@@ ble . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; h@@ h , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was then in bed , I star@@ ched to the ceiling , and thought : &quot; Oh Mann ! what have I built in it ? &quot;
a Wild@@ life sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , on to@@ ck tips to the door , and my sle@@ e@@ pers . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he bought from me is now in his class@@ room . he is now teachers .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view .
&quot; maybe people who were sold in childhood as a stran@@ ger , actually friends who just waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to host people on my air mattress , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the bub@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a track , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am un@@ employed , almost pl@@ edge , my ro@@ omm@@ ates moves and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can do it , fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have over , how we could make something . our apartment will be able to stay at a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WIFI and a desk including , a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and set up so &quot; a@@ mat@@ tresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars at the bub@@ ble on wood flooring .
&quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I am sure to decor@@ ate our cheese ham mel@@ et , completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we are touring with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest , and the door to the castle fell , star@@ ched Brian and I went to . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
the things came into roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Brass arc@@ ades , closed to us as developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether one could make it a business concept .
&quot; so we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website , on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their bathrooms , their doors one closes , when visiting past . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite them outside people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the ro@@ cket would be .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still at comfort , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned as children all that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; when you have a problem , you are on the things that you can do well . we could des@@ perate . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design much more is than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who had never met . &quot;
can design make such a difference ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a tasting , which degree of trust we shall apply . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your correspon@@ ded mobile phone in your left seat .
&quot; this quietly @-@ flight of panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door to the door . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing , what is more personal than your mobile phone is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ ced mobile phone of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most guests feel the way they can stay in a different way .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; only times , who now has Al Gor@@ es mobile ? &quot;
could you tell us on Twitter that he det@@ ects the president of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
you now have experienced which kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you some discoveries .
what if we have changed a small detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neigh@@ bor would have presented only once with his name , if he would have told what his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 Be@@ ur@@ ations that all say : &quot; he can really very well correspon@@ ded mobile phones !
how would you feel when you need to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ conceived feedback system strengthens the trust is critical .
at the beginning we did wrong some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to prevent the neg@@ atives .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had released their opinions before we asked them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probably it is that people rely on each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprisingly we trust the people most , who are most similar . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social occurrence .
exciting is it if you add the call of a person -- in our case by Be@@ ur@@ departments .
if you have less than three divisions do not change anything .
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation in simil@@ arities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply ro@@ uted preferences .
&quot; moreover , we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you can get off . &quot;
here you can see the reaction to the first message of a host .
&quot; if you tell a little about how &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells you much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather un@@ accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; T@@ olle &quot; &quot; works in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can we create it with design to establish this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what topics you should write something .
&quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards foreigners . &quot;
&quot; we did not reck@@ on , was the great deal of people who were more than ready to submit these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you can see how many people are claim@@ ing our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , : incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the un@@ ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need that had not been covered previously . &quot;
for us the business is just very good .
&quot; of course there are times , if not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties or rented apartments .
hosts can have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the fore@@ front , when trust was broken . &quot;
there is nothing Sch@@ lim@@ mer@@ es than these calls . it does already hur@@ ts when I just think .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of inv@@ ok@@ ing was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further .
fortunately had only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays only a fraction ever .
for people trust each other to law .
if trust works can be solved in a miracle .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him into the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is his evaluation :
perfect house for travellers who tend to se@@ wn activities of heart disease .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Al@@ ej@@ andra are real protective engel , which can save a life even though they do not know them at all . &quot;
&quot; driving a car into the hospital if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want that one feels lonely , they bring books past . &quot;
you can even stay longer without comp@@ ute the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course it does not run every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled for the first time about this term , I asked me : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is here for an economical trade .
&quot; but it is now just called &quot; &quot; Rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not just . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships .
people put a part of itself open and that changes everything .
&quot; nowadays it is possible to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic . &quot;
what would be when travelling a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what would be , if at any place you visit , a group there would be a resident there , a thoroughly complete and one in a pub our neighborhood you have never heard ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; today , apartments according to the principle of privacy is designed . &quot;
what if we would like to do apartments from scratch ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would have the thoughts of the common part would have taken ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parks , which belong to the government , &quot;
&quot; were now offered to residents . students , who were looking for a bin , &quot;
were given to people whose children were moved out . there were inc@@ ub@@ ator@@ programs started .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . about our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreign or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not so crazy as it was brought to us .
we do not have the wheel inv@@ ented .
hospitality there was also before .
there were already similar sites in front of us .
so why has exactly our works ?
&quot; apart from luck and Tim@@ ing , we realize that you can find the right design with the components of confidence . &quot;
design can help us overcome profound prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find this amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think every time when a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we of course know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I ask myself , what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you see me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ res@@ sed , a brain under@@ ing , a terrorist attack ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the safety che@@ que at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media people represent that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
&quot; furniture @-@ gy@@ ms , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sing@@ t , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I have decided to do it .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ tw@@ ard myself .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to carry out the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were &quot; &quot; why are you oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ tige was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of Independence , and in opposite to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought according to , ques@@ tioned and believed ultimately . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow sacrifice which deep@@ ened with every reading of the basket .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k brings me sometimes to we@@ eping .
I call myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone you percei@@ ves , you completely understands , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in essence the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had at the end of breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , aircraft flo@@ ck in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ gen from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into emp@@ owerment .
why should one do something like this ?
&quot; I moved to the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam , &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u turned into the acts of others by a citizen . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start with the formation process . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I went -- as we die -- as deep it went in my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
we moved to our apartment into our apartment in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the war@@ nings of national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d cau@@ tious , &quot; &quot; B@@ ays in good illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; di@@ mm@@ ed you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day that Muslims gather for praying .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; does not go to this first Friday , the mosque might be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understan@@ da@@ bly and I heard of attacks on Muslims , or by people who kept for Muslims , and sm@@ ote them . &quot;
there was really br@@ ass@@ aul@@ ts on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
yet something was not felt right .
&quot; because people who attacked this country , our country have attacked . &quot;
I moved the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain himself alone .
I have nothing against questions I love questions .
&quot; these are the acc@@ us@@ ations , which are hard . &quot;
&quot; nowadays , we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church such as tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or falls as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ or only stops under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , not tum@@ or in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olymp@@ ics . &quot;
will the closing of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; there may be perhaps a few parking , but not the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to the people of other faith @-@ toler@@ ant , and to show greater citizens . &quot;
&quot; and like me a head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people will actually not be radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radi@@ al process one has noticed that he can start online . as a first , the person believes in their church , so that the extrem@@ ist group believes that the person believes that terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ stain from their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot;
&quot; if we want radic@@ alization , we must keep people going to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS has its brut@@ ality with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; as Muslims , as mother , as humans , I think we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves into their imagination , if one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1,@@ 6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at it , she does not cast them what they do in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that leaves them to read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me a astonishing story :
a girl came to him because she had gone to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in touch with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she had spoken , brought her to the silence , and told her that their wrath , their sense of inj@@ ustice in the world , they would only bring into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had been given to their own mind , she was a main goal for the instru@@ alisation by extrem@@ ists who gave her a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam created the connection to God and their church again .
&quot; instead of acc@@ ord it for their hum@@ ility , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mosque , keep it before , to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use be influenced by fear every day on our democracy ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear that at least three things happen .
&quot; we are accepting a author@@ it@@ ary government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; one study reveals : if one has reported testing messages , which is negative about Muslims , they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ cis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academ@@ ical problem .
&quot; when you look at when the mood against Muslims went on top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this three times came , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the mis@@ war and during two periods of periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of the public to enhance the foundation of a free society , the reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
the treatment of Muslims is a spring water@@ mark .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear tells us all . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of coll@@ ectiv@@ ist , it is not just about to explain yourself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was at the dental Faculty , talented , much promise ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the most southern , they knew she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; when is from my br@@ otherhood , such a sealed young man has become ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was mur@@ dered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who had visited the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after completing his statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he pointed eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be in@@ moral but also fat@@ al .
so back to the beginning .
what happened to the 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we bes@@ have it and for us it was not an easy decision , for it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we went back to the mosque , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , drew my shoes out , went into the prayer sh@@ alle , and what I saw I left me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement and called our guests were welcome , because half of the gathered together were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , credit@@ ors and non @-@ believers who have come to us , but to contribute towards us . &quot;
at that moment I have coll@@ ap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number safe ?
or you will join them that are my : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks nice !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have met a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what you say that perhaps claim that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a monument with draft @-@ dr@@ au@@ ght , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you are not . I am totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my history is not unusual .
I am so usually as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the greatest possible study of Muslims throughout the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so in no way I am an exception .
&quot; if people appear as an exception to the rule , then often the rule had been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for craf@@ ting , is just before , to become a milli@@ ar@@ den@@ ial shop . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . possible , this is done in research institutes worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air par@@ cel Delivery into our social consciousness , an autonom@@ ous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
by stit@@ ching spra@@ ying high speed and acceler@@ ation on narrow space .
they can also build self @-@ constantly infl@@ amm@@ able structures .
&quot; they have learned to wear loads , to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural legislation . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the borders of the potential in the autonom@@ ous flight .
&quot; in order to work a system autonom@@ ous , it must know coll@@ ectively , where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
&quot; for today &apos;s dem@@ os we use a new loc@@ alisation technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a off@@ springs of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , comp@@ ose calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands can be started at the highest E@@ ben@@ e. e.g. &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so called &quot; &quot; h@@ eck@@ starter &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a flight device , which tries to hit two fingers with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is in the for@@ wards excursion efficient , much more efficient as a hel@@ icopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can fluctu@@ ate , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a boat @-@ side . &quot;
a limitation of h@@ eck@@ star@@ ters is that they are responding to tur@@ mo@@ il such as wind be@@ ats .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air @-@ device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be reg@@ ained and the performance through practic@@ ing can be improved .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions that penet@@ rate to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
hel@@ icopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that will join forces to hurt you .
decades ago we could fly remote @-@ controlled air equipment which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a h@@ eck@@ ru@@ der .
&quot; long , we discovered that flying with just one works . &quot;
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner that mechan@@ ically ultra @-@ simple remote @-@ device . it was inv@@ ented recently .
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hinges and trans@@ verse , no further actu@@ ator or check@@ ers , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the interior life very much , so that it can be stable and can move around in space . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear suspension . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it right when all watch , is low , therefore I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in gen@@ lon@@ eliness , this machine is here , the om@@ bs with its eight prop@@ eller , a exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is not yet symmet@@ ri@@ cally .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thus , he receives the extraordinary capability , &quot;
move in space in all directions no matter what direction it is fil@@ med or even how it is rotating .
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of inter @-@ active rivers of the eight prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; some can be imag@@ ined in models , the rest is learned right at the feet . &quot;
let &apos;s look at that .
&quot; if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
this moves in c@@ lock@@ wise
and the other against the c@@ lock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build it , they act like a high @-@ performance @-@ Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue the machine even if limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by taking a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ warming .
the large number of autonom@@ ous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took negoti@@ able micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a disc bread -- and do it with local technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think into new revolutionary ideas .
the especially secure machine since it wants to be on Broadway a flying lamp@@ shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the reward in the development and the creation act .
&quot; it serves as memory , as wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it is creative , clever creatures , they are in so exciting way to form . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the icing on the cake . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; about 1,@@ 3 billion years ago , in a very distant gal@@ ax@@ ies two black holes each other always faster , you turned so the mass of thre@@ e@@ pers in a ti@@ ti@@ ti@@ dings in pure energy . &quot;
this short moment they shining bright as all the stars together in all the gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but we put your energy in the form of light free --
&quot; finally , we are speaking of black holes . &quot;
the entire energy was shot into the space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ de in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
arrange the events initially at first time .
about 1.3 billion years ago has been living on Earth just over a thousand billion years ago .
&quot; since then the earth has seen a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , SA@@ U@@ RI@@ ER , people and -- God stand with us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group especially cour@@ ageous -- RA@@ I Weiss of MIT , K@@ IP thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- to look for a huge laser det@@ ector , which arise approximately by colon@@ ized black holes . &quot;
most they kept them crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , design and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ time , the precision of LI@@ GO could greatly increase in what the detection capacity could greatly improved . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we therefore call him Advanced LI@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; in early September 2015 , LI@@ GO has started for a final test to clarify some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ zed black holes through the earth through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott H@@ ugh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the part@@ ing from my to@@ d@@ cran@@ ken father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all that , what I had worked , is no longer science @-@ fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott H@@ ugh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigated for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their through observ@@ at@@ ories like LI@@ GO measurable signals . but what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a cro@@ wing in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; in temporary , the room and its entire content in one direction is stretched and into the other tu@@ bing . &quot;
to illustr@@ ate lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often have a really al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each one of us was stretched and pun@@ ched . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is , 20 n@@ len after comm@@ a , followed by a 1st of Dar@@ um , one explained the LI@@ GO employee for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and that &apos;s been absurd , these length would have to be measured on less than a thousand &apos;s radius of a nuclear kernel . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classical text on gravity
&quot; with K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are violent . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cist are fin@@ alists , and with the support of the public we will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LI@@ GO . Scott looks like , LI@@ GO is more a ear than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial lifts , the size of your hand . &quot;
that &apos;s quite handy . for so you can produce a picture or a map of things by seeing it from several points of coming light around you .
with tones is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that give you especially much : &quot;
the face of your child about .
&quot; instead we lau@@ gh on certain properties like sound and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , speaks just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks them . &quot;
&quot; g@@ rief Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce any simple pictures of objects in the space .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we convert wave @-@ patterns into shaft , we can hear the All literally . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ v@@ itation to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision two black holes , so my colleague Scott has been very long busy . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , p@@ ater@@ pillars simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two body very fast , you hear the same p@@ pen with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u ! &quot;
it is a kind of movement wor@@ neg@@ ate which sh@@ iel@@ ded into the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LI@@ GO Fol@@ der : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ the sound &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows how to listen to it as sound of -- two black holes with 30 @-@ fat sun mass , which is about as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : think we think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the thick@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 sun@@ shades , the other with a mass of 36 probe , revol@@ ve a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
Set up these forces .
fantastic .
and we know that we heard it .
in this there is the permanent importance of LI@@ GO .
&quot; LI@@ GO eb@@ net was a completely new way to explore the universe , as it was never before possible . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the universe and the invisible .
much in the space we can see -- practically or basically -- not see .
&quot; a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes can be done in the core , the behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ licon . &quot;
we will never go through since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the urine is covered by its own en@@ ligh@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen that we have never seen before , and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by having to listen . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO took the same in the first sight of things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that produces black holes , such as LI@@ GO she ob@@ serves , are the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient body of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to the suction no@@ zzles for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO enables us to give us a completely different point of view of the events in the All , to the origin of the stars and ultimately on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now consists of it to be as bra@@ ve as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ c@@ ater@@ pillars of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ ator@@ ies -- a brand new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in all .
for what could be more ni@@ cer than the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
before some time I tasted an experiment .
&quot; one year long I would say to all &quot; yes , &quot; before which I fear@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; no matter whether it made me nervous , me in unpleasant situations , I wish to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
I wanted to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to start with the sh@@ akes ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I fear@@ ed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches hold , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain Yes that my life changed , to an un@@ expected art . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls from un@@ declared reasons all &quot; &quot; k@@ ittens , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ ittens , I need milk for my beak @-@ free . &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes .
this yes the beginning
&quot; a new life attitude in my family . from there I got to play , always with them , as soon as you go to it . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say yes Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; fast . I am not perfect , but I paint me very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a striking side @-@ effect : only in short , I actually completely mis@@ understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ ages to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things that awak@@ ens you to life .
Trau@@ m@@ job .
no .
I am an Titan .
Trau@@ m@@ job .
I create television . I produce television .
I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours program to the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that not exist before .
the budget for a episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , three hours TV , three episodes simultaneously : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows are running on Thursday night .
around the world my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are ship@@ ments that I have created themselves , and not only produced , so still ob@@ sc@@ ure . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans for camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television stores , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , stock which will burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who that still makes ?
&quot; nobody , therefore I am an titanium . &quot;
Trau@@ m@@ job .
I would like to impress you with this .
&quot; I say it because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say to you so all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re talking to a company , a country or a class@@ room , take my business or a household , me seriously if I say that I say not only on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it is right when I say , I don &apos;t understand that there is not at a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no t@@ ears . &quot;
&quot; I work hard , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land of nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set troops on , when I was on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; thus , one portr@@ ays a high tone , lie@@ u a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and ro@@ ast@@ o@@ ily , funny and mist@@ ak@@ eable , cru@@ el and rational , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me if the work is well done .
&quot; a sw@@ amp starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sums sounds like an animated street , I could always go for you . &quot;
&quot; many people are taking them when I tell them the sums , that I will talk to me that writing my joy . &quot;
do not understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but the Sum@@ mary -- when I began working with the television production when I began to work and work to build and working together , I discovered this thing , this sw@@ amp , this energy . the sums ! &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
the sums is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the sums is music . the sums is light and air .
the sw@@ amp is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sums , then you can not strive differently than the size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling that cannot be different , than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or maybe it means a work@@ ah@@ olic too .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is called E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I know only that I &apos;m not going for failure , and I just know that I love the sw@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am an Titan , and I know that I will not ask it into question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more lab@@ s , the more lab@@ s , the more work there are the more things simultaneously , the more do I read history , the more expectations there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more need to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land that I create , the marathon , the army , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sw@@ amp . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sums .
am I only this sw@@ amp ?
and then p@@ aired the sums .
&quot; revised , sur@@ vey@@ ing , ex@@ agger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the sums stops .
&quot; now , my three daughters to the truth are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ om is a single working titles . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; My Mama will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; fo@@ b , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
there are the children of a title .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums have heard . &quot;
the sums of the engine hidden .
I don &apos;t loved my job anymore . the engine was out .
the sw@@ amp came not back .
my sp@@ y was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , pro@@ gres@@ sing weekends , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , not deleg@@ ating , a titanium sleeps not , does not give up with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sw@@ amp .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a preview of Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sums and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; ha@@ y yourself from , sil@@ ly author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you do it , you are working to be a ban@@ ker who knows a mother , one painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and that gives you like the sums you knew if the sw@@ amp stops , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart sounds , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; a question .
&quot; I am on the way out there , late dr@@ an and she says , &quot; Mama , mag@@ do you play ? &quot;
and I already don &apos;t want to say to me than two things are aware of :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , they don &apos;t let me not . &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; k@@ ittens . &quot;
when is it happened ?
&quot; I pack it if I am Titan bin and my sp@@ ans , and this is all changing in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
&quot; we play and their sisters encounter , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and in the absence of the tot@@ als , I can do nothing but to fit . &quot;
I am foc@@ uss@@ ed .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are glu@@ ed fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , w@@ sm@@ pen@@ cils and the song , in which it goes out , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and a energy difference comes in .
&quot; and that does not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sw@@ amps will slowly come back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sw@@ amp . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums of the working environment , the Titan@@ en@@ sum@@ men , which is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you , who I am , if I am treating myself using broad@@ casts and television hours , and how functional my brain is , then I for@@ got what the real sums is . &quot;
the sums is not force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sums depend on love .
the sums is the current one comes from life @-@ ust .
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums are ignored the pressure of history , which lead to erle@@ di@@ ating tasks , the expect@@ ation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God told me the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am an Titan I ? &quot;
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
I am doing this for a fixed rule so I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any blame .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice when I want to hear the sums . &quot;
I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; playing me is not set up , just as work . &quot;
the truth does hurt
but I do not like it to play .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at the workplace as a home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person is working rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , I . &quot;
&quot; time honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , is none of them . &quot;
&quot; we r@@ asen in the garden around , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance , &quot;
we sing and play Ball .
we cr@@ ushing so@@ ap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I feel overwhel@@ m@@ apped , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I g@@ rei@@ ving always on my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ als of the universe met me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever heard with the games ? &quot;
you can also tell it ! let them always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve for a servant .
&quot; you have probably right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show .
your child can be found less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me , until they s@@ laugh@@ ed that they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Marien@@ bad or K@@ eks .
&quot; and if my Teen@@ ie @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more do not need it . &quot;
everyone can take 15 minutes at a piece even at a bat d@@ une day !
15 minutes by the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to do . &quot;
but 15 minutes are penet@@ rated !
&quot; my children are my wellbeing , my world . there must not be the children . it is true to feel the tot@@ als to have a place for his sou@@ l@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; it is not about playing with their own children . it is about joy , &quot;
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I sh@@ eit@@ ere and I si@@ ege . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got up , when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to make myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes in the piece of why not take full 15 minutes to Gre@@ enland ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seems to return if I am not working .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door open up the energy flows and I find myself in my office again . I hear a well @-@ known mel@@ ody , she fills me and my soul . she lost me to new ideas . I n@@ ut@@ ze it in full and I love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the sums of the sums ... not anymore .
so@@ ap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my sums .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and for this I am so grateful . &quot;
it is me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan I saw the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country , which I aw@@ aken the marathon , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the sums , the sums of the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel the more this unusual , the more makes this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new life @-@ esteem in me wide . fewer Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly the sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think things that I awake to life .
this belongs to the job that means to live his dream .
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &apos; yes &apos; to less work and to more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trag@@ e@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geon is it very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disabilities . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I have worked functional Neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; deep underground stimulation &quot; . it impl@@ anted an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that neuro@@ logical function has improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease which sl@@ ed under fier@@ ce lem@@ on and heavy pain .
but Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading Ober@@ physician and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I experienced patients with sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that at Skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a increases the brain and the sk@@ ull pressure .
&quot; to save life , one has to dimin@@ ish the sk@@ ull pressure . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one has to sometimes remove a part of s@@ wollen brain . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen deer , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain @-@ mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to be able to grow cells from one ant@@ eb@@ est@@ ess , is comparable with very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many trials I managed Jean @-@ François .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you are still aware of the bid@@ der teaching that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface texture of the brain mass in the OP .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are im@@ mor@@ tal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split up slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell population , which looked like stem cells , but differently pronounced . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ children &apos;s cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they provide the stri@@ pping of the brain .
but why do they remain to us ?
we do not know .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentr@@ ations near brain violations . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , which enables brain @-@ healing . &quot;
this we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ speaking field , and then the cells exactly as cultiv@@ ate , as it did Jean @-@ François &quot;
and they then select colored to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we participated in the un@@ folding of the same individual . &quot;
we call the self @-@ transpl@@ ant -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we impl@@ ant these cells in normal brain tissues ? and what will happen if we reproduce the same cells in trou@@ bled brain cells ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we re@@ impl@@ anted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken over again after a few weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury to and re@@ impl@@ anted exactly the same cells and now the cells receive -- they washed away to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ impl@@ anted .
&quot; evidence that they demonstrate , these small points are . these are the cells that we are in vit@@ ro , in the culture f@@ är@@ ted . &quot;
here we could not stop .
help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a deer ?
&quot; so , we trains ape with a manual sphere . &quot;
they had to take the pellets of a tray .
they made them very well .
&quot; when they had reached a stable business level , in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex , we have the motor @-@ motor field . &quot;
&quot; then , the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they recovered spont@@ aneously to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural brain mechanisms . you can relax to a certain degree as well as in the monkey .
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkeys that recovered spont@@ aneously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original capacity before injury .
it is not as precise and not as fast .
&quot; now see when we re@@ impl@@ anted the cells in impl@@ anted : the same monkey , two months after gradu@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can free@@ ze it and later use .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models such as Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
&quot; but our dream is still , to impl@@ ant it in humans . &quot;
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : take a look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to look ahead to the future , how many years takes it , until someone can get into hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose the patient , to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it &apos;s useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi@@ centralized study . &quot;
you must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every one .
&quot; BG : and that it is certain , of course . J@@ B : natural . &quot;
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant which it is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as un@@ changing reality .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its big neigh@@ bor in Beijing have no doubt proved that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impres@@ sing growth , while politics is completely und@@ em@@ ocratic . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government - became clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not likely to influence the austerity programs that have been realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my in@@ humane friends who would repeat me , if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies will be ma@@ iled to our future , and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently threat@@ ening our economy . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; tw@@ ins &quot; &quot; parad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the deb@@ den@@ berg , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize Schul@@ den@@ berg , &quot;
but only a few recognize his tw@@ illing .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the ver@@ aging austerity and concert which might be too sc@@ ared to invest there , where it could be productive and income , with whom you need to contribute to Schul@@ den@@ berg , and also all the things might need to be urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months were invested in the US , in England and the Eurozone , 3.4 total American dollars , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , roads , roads , tracks , and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars sounds a lot of money until one compar@@ es with the 5,@@ 1 tr@@ illion dollars , which at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchange and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and Un@@ productive capital make the tw@@ ins , which is not equal through the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which could not invest in which they do not invest . just like oil , the proph@@ es@@ y of the organ could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
un@@ knew the circumstances that lead it that Ö@@ di@@ pus kill him .
this is my ha@@ v@@ eins with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely wen@@ der@@ ian Art All the Un@@ productive capital should be used to further develop our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially of the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I think . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form where the open and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ic Democracy is naturally too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , there would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these outputs . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the ath@@ e@@ uri@@ al democracy was and is that they were the working @-@ related poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and crucial that they have the right to political co @-@ determination in questions of citizenship . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ic Democracy has not kept for a long time --
&quot; as a candle , which is very bright , it is also quickly expanded . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the gl@@ or@@ rich Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy focused on free citizens and the working poor strengthened , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for ruling class . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy came only upon , as a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process took place in politics , while economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies in today &apos;s democr@@ acies is held since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an irre@@ conc@@ e@@ aled struggle between the two and the economy slowly immig@@ rant and ex@@ ert them . &quot;
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians are no longer so than before ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it is possible to be in the government nowadays , and still not in power because the power of politics is weigh@@ ed into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ ired with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about as a flo@@ ck of pre@@ dat@@ ors , which is so sustainable the animals , of which it is nour@@ ished , dec@@ aying them at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that politics has become so far ou@@ ni@@ b@@ alized by the self @-@ made economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods is increasing , economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too late to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy s@@ ells , the higher the co@@ ill@@ ary summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; when this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring about politics and the economy and it would be better if the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; control reserves , apart from the exclusion of slaves , the women and the foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t walk well .
the doctrine of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working @-@ working poor will only reg@@ ain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to create the working @-@ working arms !
capitalism does it by being replaced by limit@@ ing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ ve by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , such as long economy and politics are separate areas , the autom@@ ate the tw@@ ins apples are higher , the waste , and social conflicts are deeper , as it is very soon as I think -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and that we consider the re@@ unified field , otherwise we will appear in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that appear to the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not , whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth , survive -- &quot;
&quot; the interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines will serve man , and people put their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
&quot; I believe , we must be optim@@ istic . &quot;
&quot; so what does it look like could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ ar@@ ily Utop@@ ia &quot; instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples soon . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please see a capital market , where you have money earned while you work and in which your capital works you from a working place to the next , and the company -- no matter which one currently works -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and income , and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies but do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no di@@ vers more between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and spheres , and ultimately does not present ob@@ serving tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest variations &#93; , in the interests of the whole of humanity . &quot;
&quot; continue to show that the whole world trading in this currency is tr@@ aded -- we call it &quot; the cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the trade of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment resources are r@@ ar . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today we have it , especially against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world , which I describe to you , is at the same time liberal people prefer , and Marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the lam@@ ination of history , and ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ o , globally ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ o . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; or are we sent to a &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
the answer depends on how to decide on together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you descrip@@ tive you in your biography yourself as a liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if some of what I have said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... doing that , technological development will generate such a massive decrease in the economic demand which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only be our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , Marx is definitely relevant , &quot;
&quot; just as Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liberal Marxist and like Ke@@ yn@@ es , and that is why I am also completely wir@@ l . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are probably too . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r , you do not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you did very clearly what you think of the view of the West in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the sight of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy on politics during the area , where most of the economy - the area of economy -- is a totally more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in certain ways , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , just resem@@ bles China today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- we remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly sc@@ ep@@ tical that affects the democratic development .
&quot; what you can watch now in China , resem@@ bles a lot of development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now it &apos;s prefer@@ able to do what the West has done in the 19th century , they sm@@ elling after hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I pl@@ ains that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , of the compl@@ ac@@ ency of the self @-@ esteem , and the continuous den@@ ial den@@ ial is that a massive utilisation of the Eurozone passed through the eurozone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was , who den@@ oun@@ ce this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately it &apos;s right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the Europe group , continues to den@@ ial the den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; but you know , what is coming . &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you are trying to get a business system that is not being viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ism in life you might be able to delay a while , but when the change occurs , he happens ab@@ rupt and destru@@ ctive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change their structure .
BG : did you have any mistakes made in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any Minister who claims for 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims , he did not make any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I have made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to sign the motion for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to fall , just because they did not want to deal with transi@@ tions caused by the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to conc@@ ede that they have passed a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece since 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika &apos;s Troika &apos;s Troika has imposed this policy , and a : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all the one , and despite the aggressive tro@@ ons of the talks , you seem to be quite a @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the redund@@ ant fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be dis@@ astro@@ us alone for Europe , but for the whole world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we conc@@ ede to ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , it appears to me , it will also be able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are in this point wrong .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for providing you with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price most never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is leit@@ ner Employ@@ ee at Amazon Studios .
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a long @-@ term and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it , shows the shows and the content to ex@@ clude the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fighting industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can not choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are very right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the review distribution of more than 2500 TV series based on IM@@ DB . the assessment is showing from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows can get this review .
&quot; your show will be valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the addi@@ ctive , where when you ask a season , your brain asks , &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what goes on at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it does more thoughts about the average balance , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor poor@@ ly , they are simply not delight . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon as something makes , therefore Roy Price wants nothing to risk . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he has guaranteed success , so he is holding a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for television shows , then it produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online where they can look at any cost . &quot;
&quot; and when Amazon surrounds things , you have to go right ? &quot;
millions of viewers will look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when they look at these shows . &quot;
you will be observed by Roy and his team who receive everything .
&quot; you capture , when you start the show , when the p@@ auses , which parts you pass over , or again . &quot;
&quot; you will collect millions of data to decide with this data , which show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four rep@@ ublic@@ s American sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show can remember because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only a average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 amounts and Alpha house lan@@ det at 7,5 -- therefore something about the average , but not exactly what is happening in Roy and his team . &quot;
&quot; at the same time at another company another manager has entered a top @-@ show through data analysis . its name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for to find this a Super show and he also uses data for it , but it does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a contest , he and his team w@@ af@@ ted the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ators , so the reviews they give the shows , their shows , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use this data to find these small details about the audience , which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had together all the parts together , they entered a wagon and decided to do not make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; house of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has therefore hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted . &quot;
&quot; of course , is the question : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they combine this many data with each other , and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic somehow reflects that that should work in everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as a Back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computer .
&quot; Mind@@ este , what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis works so not working , then this is something terri@@ fying because we in a time live in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
knows someone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no . OK , this is even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope none in this room comes ever in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if any one is here in the US in prison , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is likely to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x , but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , will be decided whether a person becomes good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always generated the best results . it is not aware that a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot;
even the data of sealed companies are sometimes incorrect .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; 2009 , Google announced that it is known by Daten@@ Analysis out@@ breaks of flu , who can tell us -- by data analysis of Google Search . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news @-@ sensation . the success can be in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked properly , year round by year , until it suddenly did not work more , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it just did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of bi@@ ased companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these mistakes , data streams in decisions of life a -- at the workplace , in case of law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should prefer to ensure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have noted some samples over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be common .
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , do mostly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , you will find this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second set you put the components again in order to summar@@ ise a conclusion . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and again put together . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to merge the parts again and then come to a conclusion .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces come together again , even if the information is incomplete to summar@@ ise a good conclusion -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think I was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful , because they used data and mind , where they also go in the process . &quot;
&quot; you use the data to better understand their audience , where they would not have been able to put all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; this was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; however , Amazon did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they have used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV @-@ ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe choice because they were always saying , &quot; &quot; that we tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better choices , but I believe that things go wrong when data does begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool and to do not forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before it was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using an Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to get the ball sh@@ ake to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- just here at this moment . &quot;
I will come later with a techni@@ cian .
&quot; I have made some decisions made in my life , whereby I would have to hear in the ball to the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through a little bit of excer@@ pts , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; perhaps the ball cl@@ ever@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I find this as very encouraging message , that despite the large amount of data still pays off , decisions to make an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; for in the end it is not the data , but the risks which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks nice .
