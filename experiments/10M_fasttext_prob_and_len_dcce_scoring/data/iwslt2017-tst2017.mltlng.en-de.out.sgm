<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize in the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone had heard by Edward Snowden, Risen One book, in which he looks spectacular that the NSA took illegally of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US secret co-operation, where the CIA" CIA "literally blows for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the loopy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not feel the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government has been determined on the edges and called it to name its innate sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol of the patterns of the government, whistle-whistle to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Supplement, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mud."</seg>
<seg id="14">"thus, when the government has anchored, he did something that many courageous reporters have already done before him, he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived in prison with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days prior to the process, a something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they had been given for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped off."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than to fail and bring rise to the statements, which could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators have worried, without his consent, his telephone-wise geheim,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just as his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even travel-wise with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblowers and risk of risk."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is just one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke to his grace to protect whistleblowers. but instead the judiciary has sentenced more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government can become much of her work as geheim."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since the 11th of September, almost every article on national security was the result of such a whistle-lower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we are setting the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional referendum, because the government has ever more possibilities to play all out."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can contact them from the moment in which they contact, rather than in advance, in the stuff."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that it has not yet been written as risen, and it is much safer than regular e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an open-source overhead system for whistleblowers which was originally developed by the presence of Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot store more information secretly, and many of the information they would request, would not be available from pre-start."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments all over the world develop new Spionagettechnologies that meet us all at risk."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to make sure that not only technology denominator such as Edward Snowden have a way to exchange misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the over abnormalities in the care of soldiers humble knows and reported by crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm on the versioning water of Flint suggests. or a pilgrimage-street, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data cheque has been hidden in history.] [the "Panama Papers' revealed that Reiche and powers] [mean that] [we baten Robert Palmer by Global Witness to have an explanation.] this week we were posted by news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, such as the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that a composite of the brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad briefing firms in tax havens has."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin introduces, through a tight friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others give the nervous to the next release, and the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the Plot of an agency or a John-Grisham-ROMANS.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems wept away from you, to me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we handle what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens, and not all pay its taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians, how secret tax havens will be used by some few to hide and wear -- something that we have been discussing and miscellaneous for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people this whole world will be very confusing, and it's hard to understand how this tax havens function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a matrjodoom.</seg>
<seg id="60">"thus, one has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there is fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were so far no prominent Americans who arrived in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which this tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data base from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples which have connections to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states need less information to specify less information to create a company than to get a library."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed the employees of school-circulating school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">"it has been allowed, especially vulnerable investors."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">"here at Global Witness, we wanted to figure out how all this in practice looks."</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a covered revival in the offices of 13 Anwaltscompanies in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigation gave himself as African ministers, who wanted to bring money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"it really is shocked it really, that all up to an attorney made by our investigator suggestions, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all prehensions. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course, nobody was passed to money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single use.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single attorney, who has submerged proposals to our rescapped proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top pole, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to dare this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound all very little thing as if we could do anything against it, as if nothing could ever change; as if it will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as born-born, I really see that a lot has begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen presences towards greater transparency, which concerns the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is recorded in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not do the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama's revelations, that huge insight into the world of tax havens, as a means is used to provide more transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people that are angry, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the headlamps."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy that stand up and say," Intransparent is not good for the business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians to realise the problem and use it, by laws to end this kind of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can end the intransparent which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backseat."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and look my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made just a roadtrip throughout the country. after that he would go to peacscorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you kill them tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing even worse," I do not know it. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What can I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation not?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him again! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he is really planning. I will not kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have a bubble. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "hh, as please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was then in bed, I starched to the ceiling, and thought:" Oh Mann! what have I built in it? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A Wildlife sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, on tock tips to the door, and my sleepers."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he bought from me is now in his classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe people who were sold in childhood as a stranger, actually friends who just waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to host people on my air mattress, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the bubble."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a track, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pledge, my roommates moves and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can do it, fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have over, how we could make something. our apartment will be able to stay at a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WIFI and a desk including, a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and set up so "amattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast "[AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars at the bubble on wood flooring.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it great, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure to decorate our cheese ham melet, completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we are touring with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest, and the door to the castle fell, starched Brian and I went to."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Brass arcades, closed to us as developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented ourselves to the investors:" "we want to create a website, on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their bathrooms, their doors one closes, when visiting past."</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite them outside people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would be.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still at comfort, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"when you have a problem, you are on the things that you can do well. we could desperate."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design much more is than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who had never met."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a difference?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a tasting, which degree of trust we shall apply."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your corresponded mobile phone in your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietly-flight of panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door to the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing, what is more personal than your mobile phone is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unced mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel the way they can stay in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only times, who now has Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he detects the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced which kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have presented only once with his name, if he would have told what his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 Beurations that all say: "he can really very well corresponded mobile phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you need to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system strengthens the trust is critical.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did wrong some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to prevent the negatives.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had released their opinions before we asked them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probably it is that people rely on each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprisingly we trust the people most, who are most similar."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting is it if you add the call of a person -- in our case by Beurdepartments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three divisions do not change anything.</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation in similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply routed preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you can get off."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reaction to the first message of a host.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell a little about how" "Hi!", "you do not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells you much, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is also rather unaccepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "Tolle" "works in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to establish this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on what topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices towards foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="194">"we did not reckon, was the great deal of people who were more than ready to submit these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people are claiming our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first,: incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need that had not been covered previously."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course there are times, if not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts can have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the forefront, when trust was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing Schlimmeres than these calls. it does already hurts when I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of invoking was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately had only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays only a fraction ever.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other to law.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works can be solved in a miracle.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his evaluation:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travellers who tend to sewn activities of heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protective engel, which can save a life even though they do not know them at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"driving a car into the hospital if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want that one feels lonely, they bring books past."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without compute the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course it does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled for the first time about this term, I asked me:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here for an economical trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just called" "Rental industry", "the thing is not just."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of itself open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"nowadays it is possible to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be when travelling a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be, if at any place you visit, a group there would be a resident there, a thoroughly complete and one in a pub our neighborhood you have never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"today, apartments according to the principle of privacy is designed."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to do apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the thoughts of the common part would have taken?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships, instead of solitude and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parks, which belong to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"were now offered to residents. students, who were looking for a bin,"</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were moved out. there were incubatorprograms started.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. about our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreign or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not so crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We do not have the wheel invented.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has exactly our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and Timing, we realize that you can find the right design with the components of confidence."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time when a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I ask myself, what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain undering, a terrorist attack?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety cheque at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media people represent that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">"furniture-gyms,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga singt, because, baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do it.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met the decision to outward myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to carry out the hijab, my head."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist girlfriends were" "why are you oppressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, and in opposite to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unreachable beauty."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought according to, questioned and believed ultimately."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow sacrifice which deepened with every reading of the basket.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik brings me sometimes to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I call myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone you perceives, you completely understands, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in essence the" Egyptian-American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had at the end of breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" breaking News. "</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, aircraft flock in buildings, people sprangen from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into empowerment.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I moved to the television channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists"... "..." in the name of Islam, "..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu turned into the acts of others by a citizen."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start with the formation process."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I went -- as we die -- as deep it went in my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment into our apartment in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, saw and read the warnings of national Islamic organizations that said:" be vigilant, "" Seid cautious, "" Bays in good illuminated areas, "" dimmed you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day that Muslims gather for praying.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" does not go to this first Friday, the mosque might be a destination. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably and I heard of attacks on Muslims, or by people who kept for Muslims, and smote them."</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really brassaults on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">Yet something was not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who attacked this country, our country have attacked."</seg>
<seg id="315">I moved the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">"these are the accusations, which are hard."</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually say people say:" there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church such as tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor falls as a whole and a benign tumor only stops under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, not tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympics. "</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be perhaps a few parking, but not the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to the people of other faith-tolerant, and to show greater citizens."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and like me a head of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people will actually not be radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radial process one has noticed that he can start online. as a first, the person believes in their church, so that the extremist group believes that the person believes that terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abstain from their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or belief."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want radicalization, we must keep people going to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS has its brutality with the Quran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslims, as mother, as humans, I think we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves into their imagination, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if one throws a look at it, she does not cast them what they do in their" Holy Scriptures. "</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that leaves them to read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me a astonishing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had gone to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in touch with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she had spoken, brought her to the silence, and told her that their wrath, their sense of injustice in the world, they would only bring into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had been given to their own mind, she was a main goal for the instrualisation by extremists who gave her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam created the connection to God and their church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accord it for their humility, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, keep it before, to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use be influenced by fear every day on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are accepting a authoritary government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"one study reveals: if one has reported testing messages, which is negative about Muslims, they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academical problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look at when the mood against Muslims went on top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this three times came, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the miswar and during two periods of periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to enhance the foundation of a free society, the reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The treatment of Muslims is a spring watermark.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear tells us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collectivist, it is not just about to explain yourself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental Faculty, talented, much promise..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the most southern, they knew she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is from my brotherhood, such a sealed young man has become?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who had visited the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution, after completing his statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He pointed eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be inmoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened to the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we beshave it and for us it was not an easy decision, for it was about what America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we went back to the mosque, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, drew my shoes out, went into the prayer shalle, and what I saw I left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement and called our guests were welcome, because half of the gathered together were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, creditors and non-believers who have come to us, but to contribute towards us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and compassion and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will join them that are my: we are better than that.</seg>

<seg id="407">"what began as a platform for crafting, is just before, to become a milliardenial shop."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. possible, this is done in research institutes worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air parcel Delivery into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">By stitching spraying high speed and acceleration on narrow space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-constantly inflammable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to wear loads, to deal with turmoil and generally react to natural legislation."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the borders of the potential in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order to work a system autonomous, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localisation technology of Verity Studios, a offsprings of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, compose calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands can be started at the highest Ebene. e.g." "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so called" "heckstarter" ""</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight device, which tries to hit two fingers with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is in the forwards excursion efficient, much more efficient as a helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can fluctuate, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a boat-side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of heckstarters is that they are responding to turmoil such as wind beats.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air-device doesn't matter in which position the optimum position can be regained and the performance through practicing can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often provide basic abstract questions that penetrate to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that will join forces to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago we could fly remote-controlled air equipment which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a heckruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">"long, we discovered that flying with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner that mechanically ultra-simple remote-device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and transverse, no further actuator or checkers, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, happens in the interior life very much, so that it can be stable and can move around in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear suspension. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it right when all watch, is low, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is a exercise in genloneliness, this machine is here, the ombs with its eight propeller, a exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not yet symmetrically.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he receives the extraordinary capability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions no matter what direction it is filmed or even how it is rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of inter-active rivers of the eight propeller."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some can be imagined in models, the rest is learned right at the feet."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This moves in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build it, they act like a high-performance-Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue the machine even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by taking a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression. "</seg>
<seg id="460">We took negotiable micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a disc bread -- and do it with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think into new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially secure machine since it wants to be on Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the reward in the development and the creation act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as memory, as wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it is creative, clever creatures, they are in so exciting way to form."</seg>
<seg id="467">"the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the icing on the cake."</seg>

<seg id="477">"since then the earth has seen a lot: corals, fish, plants, SAURIER, people and -- God stand with us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group especially courageous -- RAI Weiss of MIT, KIP thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- to look for a huge laser detector, which arise approximately by colonized black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people realized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, design and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser-Interferometer- Gravitational-observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-time, the precision of LIGO could greatly increase in what the detection capacity could greatly improved."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, we therefore call him Advanced LIGO."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in early September 2015, LIGO has started for a final test to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collized black holes through the earth through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting from my todcranken father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that, what I had worked, is no longer science-fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigated for 23 years of gravitational waves from black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals. but what are Gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a crowing in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"in temporary, the room and its entire content in one direction is stretched and into the other tubing."</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate lecturers in courses for relativity theory often have a really albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that Gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each one of us was stretched and punched. the elongation of an average human being was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is, 20 nlen after comma, followed by a 1st of Darum, one explained the LIGO employee for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and that's been absurd, these length would have to be measured on less than a thousand's radius of a nuclear kernel. that's grotesk."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text on gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"with KIP Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are violent. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicist are finalists, and with the support of the public we will certainly overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott looks like, LIGO is more a ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial lifts, the size of your hand."</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite handy. for so you can produce a picture or a map of things by seeing it from several points of coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that give you especially much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we laugh on certain properties like sound and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, speaks just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob breaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"grief Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce any simple pictures of objects in the space.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave-patterns into shaft, we can hear the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision two black holes, so my colleague Scott has been very long busy."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, paterpillars simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two body very fast, you hear the same ppen with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement wornegate which shielded into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LIGO Folder: [surrenthe sound] Jemand, who knows how to listen to it as sound of -- two black holes with 30-fat sun mass, which is about as fast as the sticks of your mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think we think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the thickest body in space, one with a mass of 29 sunshades, the other with a mass of 36 probe, revolve a hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Set up these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the permanent importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"LIGO ebnet was a completely new way to explore the universe, as it was never before possible."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in the space we can see -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes can be done in the core, the behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the urine is covered by its own enlighten."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we have never seen before, and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by having to listen."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO took the same in the first sight of things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that produces black holes, such as LIGO she observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient body of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to the suction nozzles for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO enables us to give us a completely different point of view of the events in the All, to the origin of the stars and ultimately on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists of it to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circaterpillars of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on Earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more nicer than the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Before some time I tasted an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"one year long I would say to all" yes, "before which I feared."</seg>

<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches hold, my social fear -- Puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes that my life changed, to an unexpected art. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls from undeclared reasons all" "kittens,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-free."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said: "yes.</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new life attitude in my family. from there I got to play, always with them, as soon as you go to it. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I say yes Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"fast. I am not perfect, but I paint me very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a striking side-effect: only in short, I actually completely misunderstood that the" Yes "-Sages to play with my children my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things that awakens you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Traumjob.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am an Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Traumjob.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style. "</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for bringing 70 hours program to the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days of four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, three hours TV, three episodes simultaneously: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV shows are running on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shipments that I have created themselves, and not only produced, so still obscure. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans for campfire and to tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television stores, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, stock which will burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that still makes?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, therefore I am an titanium."</seg>
<seg id="599">Traumjob.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would like to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it because I know what you think, if the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say to you so all of you who work so hard if you're talking to a company, a country or a classroom, take my business or a household, me seriously if I say that I say not only on the computer and imaginative, and it is right when I say, I don't understand that there is not at a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work hard, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set troops on, when I was on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"thus, one portrays a high tone, lieu a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, tiring and roastoily, funny and mistakeable, cruel and rational, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work is well done.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a swamp starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like an animated street, I could always go for you."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people are taking them when I tell them the sums, that I will talk to me that writing my joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the Summary -- when I began working with the television production when I began to work and work to build and working together, I discovered this thing, this swamp, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The swamp is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, then you can not strive differently than the size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling that cannot be different, than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means a workaholic too.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I'm not going for failure, and I just know that I love the swamp."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am an Titan, and I know that I will not ask it into question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more labs, the more labs, the more work there are the more things simultaneously, the more do I read history, the more expectations there."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to succeed, the more need to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land that I create, the marathon, the army, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this swamp. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this swamp?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then paired the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, surveying, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters to the truth are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single working titles."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people," My Mama will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "fob, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a title.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums have heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine hidden.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't loved my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The swamp came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My spy was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, progressing weekends, no repentance, not delegating, a titanium sleeps not, does not give up with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no swamp.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a preview of Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work that you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "hay yourself from, silly author-titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you do it, you are working to be a banker who knows a mother, one painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another and that gives you like the sums you knew if the swamp stops, who is one then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart sounds, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out there, late dran and she says," Mama, magdo you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already don't want to say to me than two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, they don't let me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is it happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I pack it if I am Titan bin and my spans, and this is all changing in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. "</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters encounter, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatic from the book" Everybody poops "." "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the totals, I can do nothing but to fit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are glued fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wsmpencils and the song, in which it goes out, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. "</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and a energy difference comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that does not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The swamps will slowly come back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a swamp."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums of the working environment, the Titanensummen, which is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you, who I am, if I am treating myself using broadcasts and television hours, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the current one comes from life-ust.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums are ignored the pressure of history, which lead to erlediating tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God told me the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am an Titan I?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love. "</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this for a fixed rule so I can free myself as a workaholic of any blame.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice when I want to hear the sums."</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it. "</seg>
<seg id="721">"playing me is not set up, just as work."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt</seg>
<seg id="723">But I do not like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a person is working rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"time honest, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>

<seg id="740">You can also tell it! let them always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon is it very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I have worked functional Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most prominent, the" deep underground stimulation ". it implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that neurological function has improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which sled under fierce lemon and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">But Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading Oberphysician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I experienced patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that at Skull-brain traumata increases the brain and the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one has to diminish the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"therefore, one has to sometimes remove a part of swollen brain."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen deer, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain-mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to be able to grow cells from one antebestess, is comparable with very small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trials I managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the bidder teaching that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface texture of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split up slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, weird cell population, which looked like stem cells, but differently pronounced."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandchildren's cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they provide the stripping of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain violations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"" "we stand in front of a potential cell source, which enables brain-healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-speaking field, and then the cells exactly as cultivate, as it did Jean-François"</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then select colored to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we participated in the unfolding of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the self-transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissues? and what will happen if we reproduce the same cells in troubled brain cells?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken over again after a few weeks, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells receive -- they washed away to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence that they demonstrate, these small points are. these are the cells that we are in vitro, in the culture färted."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a deer?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we trains ape with a manual sphere."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take the pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable business level, in the motoric cortex, we have the motor-motor field."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of sculptural brain mechanisms. you can relax to a certain degree as well as in the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkeys that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original capacity before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we reimplanted the cells in implanted: the same monkey, two months after graduation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models such as Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">"but our dream is still, to implant it in humans."</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: take a look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to look ahead to the future, how many years takes it, until someone can get into hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to choose the patient, to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it's useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multicentralized study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every one.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is certain, of course. JB: natural."</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant which it is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchanging reality.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its big neighbor in Beijing have no doubt proved that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressing growth, while politics is completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"indeed, the democracy comes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government - became clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not likely to influence the austerity programs that have been realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my inhumane friends who would repeat me, if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies will be mailed to our future, and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"for the issue of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently threatening our economy."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twins" "paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debdenberg, which throws its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize Schuldenberg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twilling.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the veraging austerity and concert which might be too scared to invest there, where it could be productive and income, with whom you need to contribute to Schuldenberg, and also all the things might need to be urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months were invested in the US, in England and the Eurozone, 3.4 total American dollars, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, roads, roads, tracks, and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billions US dollars sounds a lot of money until one compares with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchange and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debt and Unproductive capital make the twins, which is not equal through the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which could not invest in which they do not invest. just like oil, the prophesy of the organ could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unknew the circumstances that lead it that Ödipus kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haveins with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely wenderian Art All the Unproductive capital should be used to further develop our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially of the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form where the open and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenic Democracy is naturally too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, there would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Athenian democracy due to these outputs."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the atheurial democracy was and is that they were the working-related poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and crucial that they have the right to political co-determination in questions of citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenic Democracy has not kept for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"as a candle, which is very bright, it is also quickly expanded."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorrich Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenic democracy focused on free citizens and the working poor strengthened, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy came only upon, as a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process took place in politics, while economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies in today's democracies is held since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an irreconcealed struggle between the two and the economy slowly immigrant and exert them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer so than before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it is possible to be in the government nowadays, and still not in power because the power of politics is weighed into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haired with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about as a flock of predators, which is so sustainable the animals, of which it is nourished, decaying them at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that politics has become so far ounibalized by the self-made economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods is increasing, economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too late to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" demos "[the people] from democracy sells, the higher the coillary summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"when this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring about politics and the economy and it would be better if the" demos "control reserves, apart from the exclusion of slaves, the women and the foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn't walk well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working-working poor will only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the working-working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by being replaced by limiting Niedriglove by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, such as long economy and politics are separate areas, the automate the twins apples are higher, the waste, and social conflicts are deeper, as it is very soon as I think -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and that we consider the reunified field, otherwise we will appear in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that appear to the film" matrix "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not, whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth, survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "in which machines will serve man, and people put their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">"I believe, we must be optimistic."</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what does it look like could it look like this" star Trek "-arily Utopia" instead of the "matrix" -similar dystopia? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples soon."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please see a capital market, where you have money earned while you work and in which your capital works you from a working place to the next, and the company -- no matter which one currently works -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and income, and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies but do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no divers more between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and spheres, and ultimately does not present observing twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest variations], in the interests of the whole of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"continue to show that the whole world trading in this currency is traded -- we call it" the cosmos "," in units of "Cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade of the respective country into a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment resources are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have it, especially against the background of a reunified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world, which I describe to you, is at the same time liberal people prefer, and Marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the lamination of history, and keynesio, globally keynesio."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"or are we sent to a" "matrix" "- similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how to decide on together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You descriptive you in your biography yourself as a liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if some of what I have said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... doing that, technological development will generate such a massive decrease in the economic demand which Larry Summers is called" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only be our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, Marx is definitely relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just as Hayek, this is why I am a liberal Marxist and like Keynes, and that is why I am also completely wirl."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are probably too."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not wirr, you do not think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you did very clearly what you think of the view of the West in China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the sight of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy on politics during the area, where most of the economy - the area of economy -- is a totally more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in certain ways, if I can say this provocative, just resembles China today to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"because -- we remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical that affects the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what you can watch now in China, resembles a lot of development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now it's preferable to do what the West has done in the 19th century, they smelling after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I plains that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, of the complacency of the self-esteem, and the continuous denial denial is that a massive utilisation of the Eurozone passed through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was, who denounce this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately it's right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Europe group, continues to denial the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but you know, what is coming."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you are trying to get a business system that is not being viable, through political will and authoritism in life you might be able to delay a while, but when the change occurs, he happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes made in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any Minister who claims for 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he claims, he did not make any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I have made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the motion for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government to fall, just because they did not want to deal with transitions caused by the Eurozone."</seg>

<seg id="1026">"none of the Troika's Troika's Troika has imposed this policy, and a:" that was a colossal mistake. "</seg>

<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the redundant fliers will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price most never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leitner Employee at Amazon Studios.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a long-term and describes on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it, shows the shows and the content to exclude the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fighting industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are very right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the review distribution of more than 2500 TV series based on IMDB. the assessment is showing from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows can get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"your show will be valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows, the addictive, where when you ask a season, your brain asks," where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you enough what goes on at that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer" Toddlers and Tiaras "." "</seg>
<seg id="1056">"it does more thoughts about the average balance, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor poorly, they are simply not delight."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon as something makes, therefore Roy Price wants nothing to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he has guaranteed success, so he is holding a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for television shows, then it produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online where they can look at any cost."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and when Amazon surrounds things, you have to go right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers will look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when they look at these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be observed by Roy and his team who receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture, when you start the show, when the pauses, which parts you pass over, or again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"you will collect millions of data to decide with this data, which show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and this results the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republics American senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many of these show can remember because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only a average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,4 amounts and Alpha house landet at 7,5 -- therefore something about the average, but not exactly what is happening in Roy and his team."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time at another company another manager has entered a top-show through data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for to find this a Super show and he also uses data for it, but it does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a contest, he and his team wafted the existing data about the Netflix spectators, so the reviews they give the shows, their shows, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use this data to find these small details about the audience, which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had together all the parts together, they entered a wagon and decided to do not make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," house of Cards ". Netflix has therefore hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, is the question: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine this many data with each other, and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow reflects that that should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a Back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"Mindeste, what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis works so not working, then this is something terrifying because we in a time live in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Knows someone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope none in this room comes ever in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if any one is here in the US in prison, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is likely to determine whether a dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix, but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, will be decided whether a person becomes good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always generated the best results. it is not aware that a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of sealed companies are sometimes incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009, Google announced that it is known by DatenAnalysis outbreaks of flu, who can tell us -- by data analysis of Google Search."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news-sensation. the success can be in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked properly, year round by year, until it suddenly did not work more,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it just did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of biased companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these mistakes, data streams in decisions of life a -- at the workplace, in case of law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should prefer to ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have noted some samples over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be common.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, do mostly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, you will find this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second set you put the components again in order to summarise a conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and again put together."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to merge the parts again and then come to a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces come together again, even if the information is incomplete to summarise a good conclusion -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think I was Netflix so successful, because they used data and mind, where they also go in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"you use the data to better understand their audience, where they would not have been able to put all these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards "," this was not in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"however, Amazon did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they have used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV-ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe choice because they were always saying," "that we tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better choices, but I believe that things go wrong when data does begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool and to do not forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before it was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it's amazing. for decisions using an Ja- or no-question you just need to get the ball shake to get an answer." most likely "-- just here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will come later with a technician.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have made some decisions made in my life, whereby I would have to hear in the ball to the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through a little bit of excerpts, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball cleverer and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I find this as very encouraging message, that despite the large amount of data still pays off, decisions to make an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for in the end it is not the data, but the risks which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
