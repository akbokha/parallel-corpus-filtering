Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where youth is going to meet young people today .
a tomb which is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
petty @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers manage the one @-@ borne reason for farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s nerv@@ ousness if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had already begun to rain , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green meadow instead of a revers@@ ing road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the government government , is anything but up @-@ to @-@ date . &quot;
especially if you compar@@ es them with current online cards .
&quot; then , the cities and municipalities are transformed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ ent@@ epp@@ i that one sees as such is not the same .
&quot; in the great picture postcard were made for towns and municipalities in more detailed cards , so @-@ called urine leaves . &quot;
these emerged according to the information of the Bav@@ arian Ver@@ im@@ meas@@ urer between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and jump to first Ver@@ messung of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition @-@ war with Austria .
Napoleon wants an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if French troops were moved with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : there were the present neighbors , who created the idea of an extensive Bavaria card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; and thus the Bav@@ arian Ver@@ im@@ meas@@ urer . &quot;
the copyright holder for Munich dates back to 1856 from the year 1856 and is like to find all the other on the website of the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ library .
the comparison of Fru@@ its / Today is the example of the state capital of the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was signed 21 years after the card , thus 1877 as a Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses under@@ springs in 1856 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was only named in 1878 by Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of the Bav@@ arian farmer against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when Zoom out appears a small @-@ piece card with do@@ z@@ ens lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; from which the property tax was de@@ duced . &quot;
&quot; small pitches today , there are no need for farmers today - but the gar@@ den@@ er of the &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of October , was in the 19th century a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychi@@ atric medicine .
&quot; in the event of the present district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of today &apos;s district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only reads the street names &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or of the &quot; &quot; ight &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße , one once found people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; had emerged . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard ruled by Gu@@ dden the establishment of the psychi@@ at@@ rist , which is brought in connection with the death of King Lud@@ wi@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time , and ended for example the sale of the so called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; moreover , he is forbidden to use the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients was first place , later it was expanded to 500 places . &quot;
sometime this capacity is no longer considered - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
&quot; there since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest psychi@@ atri@@ cs Germany . &quot;
on the field of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt meet young people in Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Or@@ den war@@ b the buildings in 1920 and walked him in a youth @-@ home with training .
&quot; west is the football field of the T@@ SV Munich east , east residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children @-@ house &quot; &quot; Casa don Bosco &quot; &quot; was set to be destroyed in ar@@ rest of the country of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ unci@@ ation during World War II in the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was in 1856 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the purchase route was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a great stayed until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the German Institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once on the Marien@@ hof , where these days were the pre@@ working and on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ aten@@ sti@@ ch for the second S @-@ Bahn station . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the air @-@ picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marien@@ hof . &quot;
Citiz@@ ens of Citiz@@ ens publ@@ ishes Reis@@ ew@@ ar@@ ming for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ above has issued a warning for colored people who are on account of discri@@ min@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the State to Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , who , until 28 August 2017 , calls for A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , when travelling through the state have special attention and notice , since a number of frag@@ ile , r@@ ally @-@ based fores@@ ees in recent times occur and here , it is stated in the position of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to gain discrimination authorities , as well as the prosec@@ ution authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportion@@ ate to minorities , illustr@@ ates the group that dism@@ iss@@ al , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are raised because of their skin colour , they are be@@ aten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Ro@@ d Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard .
it is the first such a warning issued by the organisation for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group bin@@ ed inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist betra@@ yed against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under ques@@ tion@@ worthy circumstances in the beginning of the year after having been taken no gas@@ oline during the journey through the state , and taken by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in prison , without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the office of the General State Department of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which it is shown that black drivers will be more common in the state 75 percent more common than past@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff inform about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people need to be ready whether it may bring deposits , or know relatives that they travel through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i moved into the year 2015 100 Hass@@ an &apos;s break according to the latest numbers from the Hass@@ le @-@ reporting programme of the F@@ BI , which achiev@@ es the state with regard to the number of such injuries at the 16th position of the country . &quot;
&quot; the be@@ eke@@ eping is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union had published the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) Reis@@ ew@@ ar@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , the local prosec@@ ut@@ ational Auth@@ orities had to commit people because of immigration . &quot;
&quot; buses are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders has used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
past@@ ure project is el@@ ement@@ ar
the fisher@@ man past@@ ure project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac have provided a picture on the spot .
at the leg@@ grab@@ ance of the family Schwen@@ dem@@ ann met representatives of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U @-@ local association with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann offers an insights into his company , in which he was surrounded by 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , surrounded by 40 cows and as many young animals , and in five apartments tourist guests . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ mil@@ ch &quot; is for him the altern@@ ating mark@@ eter away for the milk of its cows , so swi@@ vel . &quot;
on the table of the resort only Regi@@ on@@ ales comes exclusively .
&quot; since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fisher@@ bach , he describes the past@@ ure project as &quot; el@@ ement@@ ar . &quot; &quot;
I can not manage to such a steep incl@@ ination .
&quot; the green area , for a lot of work , much m@@ nuts with the motor sense are processed . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the Top@@ o@@ graphics , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the el@@ ectoral operation and managed this without chemical pesti@@ cides and fertilizers , even if he does not lead to a bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the significance of the past@@ ure project and is happy about the leader of the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers need to be supported . &quot;
we hope that the for@@ estation of the surfaces could still be moved quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure that we have , are people who work in agriculture and make their thoughts on how they continued their operation , &quot; stressed the may@@ or . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of funding often
the past@@ ure promotion were fenced in 2013 in a total of 25 plots from eleven participants .
&quot; the disclosure area is about 40 hectares , which can not be re@@ for@@ ated until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total of 71 500 Euro , half of the Leader has been funded , a quarter carried away by the municipality of Fisher@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the farmers have had 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac stressed : &quot; &quot; you makes a really good job , without farmers and land@@ fill it is not . &quot;
also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot;
the Land@@ sc@@ apes ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of past@@ ors .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black @-@ purpose .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ signed sponsors .
&quot; moreover , the fence area must not be sm@@ ir@@ able ( h@@ ang@@ ing gradient over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man past@@ ure project , in 2018 , the request for eight participants already runs with 24 plots , which we want to build a total of 16 kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the cal@@ ulated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
&quot; now , the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
the safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore car@@ ved fall of Saddam H@@ uss@@ one on the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Mill@@ er , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did , as he did a symbolic Ax@@ t in a h@@ it@@ ous dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dr@@ astic restrictions on the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Mill@@ er did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
there would have been a hor@@ de of jet@@ ties and Liberty @-@ Im@@ medi@@ ators if he had done it .
&quot; but he laid hold of their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Mill@@ er A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I will not go here to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom , which is illuminated the world . &quot;
the poem in which you refer to that later was added and not part of the original freedom of Liberty .
&quot; Mill@@ er is proper , but as he formed it himself , it is not really about story . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the emerging words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state will not only invites any old immigrants , but the trou@@ bles of the poor : &quot; thy poor , / thy afflic@@ ted masses , who like to breathe free , / the el@@ ending waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; drop waste &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot;
Mill@@ er committed himself into liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict in the significance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after their death on the base - knew very good that they made a high @-@ political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ an@@ ism by presenting them in an ab@@ used classical image presentation of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem is the feminine figure out more abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , the people wanted to change from the right wing this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry @-@ when Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , arg@@ um@@ ented in 2010 , that the free statue of Liberty nobody un@@ la@@ de but rather an early Ne@@ ok@@ on@@ serv@@ ative be that the American flame goes into the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it is intended to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ches should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way into the United States .
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something st@@ olen .
the meaning of the statue is entirely and a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted in them to see them as they were by the exhaus@@ tive , el@@ end , but hop@@ eless people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships were seen . &quot;
it is in the tru@@ est sense about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome to hear them .
and of course this is not the perspective that Mill@@ er and Tru@@ mp ever wanted to recognise .
&quot; their tor@@ ches should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the path , but the hate that is their only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
world championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ om Scottish members of the Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two vill@@ i were to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the power director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ headed cont@@ ingent cont@@ ests in the World Championship Series &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ete was chosen for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland &apos;s something special &quot; , &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue to continue until we find it &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ete think that it has something to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ete are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which can compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah during E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle from the team to the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was amazing , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were dirty or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the E@@ ili@@ ie quite naturally entered , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth of Silver medal , which is in its fifth world championship with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; is that 16 br@@ aces are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland has hi@@ therto been the best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven , the 1983 and 2015 were achieved . &quot;
the road @-@ run@@ ners Mu@@ ir is leading on this road and has set up five British records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5.000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another sh@@ ear@@ ed that one should consider after a great season which should win the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary games . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ yle was re@@ minded of her first World Championships , when the only other car@@ rot was in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; the Mann@@ en@@ ts captain in says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their land@@ lords are not only part of the team , but in some cases also in the medals and with the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the particular note to his team captain , lies in it that it was elected by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor to me , but to know that my team @-@ mate have voted for me and chose me to something very special for me , &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i , which belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to rise on po@@ ds . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain concerned ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
&quot; I have only noted that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home World Championship . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from it , that we are back at the Olympiastadion . &quot;
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be just as a great atmosphere out there .
blo@@ cking of critics via Facebook : transfer you not to a public office when you cannot wear the he@@ aters of voters .
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers sm@@ ote him because of all the internal policy up to its political principles . &quot;
he sh@@ opp@@ ed in criticism to be sure .
but he has not brought his critics to the silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 said Washington : &quot; &quot; the freedom of expression can be taken away - and , du@@ mm and mu@@ te , we are led as the sheep for battles . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland , Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to work more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endants him therefore at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the st@@ ab of the govern@@ or left the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a rep@@ ublic@@ ans Gover@@ nor in a overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the two th@@ est consent of the 50 Govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary Hit@@ z@@ ead .
he demonstrated a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to combine with its voters and play@@ able his ha@@ ired head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ ages of persons who come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - the public forum is known as officially , and by employees who will pay with public tax rewards - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post defended Ho@@ gans Am@@ elia Spe@@ ak Am@@ elia the acts of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ing that the block@@ age of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tropical or sp@@ as@@ ps , or h@@ asser@@ t people who vibr@@ ate online the P@@ eit@@ sche . &quot;
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a past@@ or , no trojan . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments resp@@ ectable , thought@@ ful , and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the parish priests passed the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans ca@@ tho@@ lic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked to hate them . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other latest news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the delivery &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic , then it is rather than a so @-@ so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the employees of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably call themselves &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blo@@ cking a message by simply blocked a cri@@ tic or a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much clean@@ ers than in earlier times , if you have done the same that staff have been sent to collect newspapers with critical guidelines and to burn prot@@ esters or demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but that is exactly what is happening at digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official which he cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed to it that he implic@@ ates Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is charged by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County Ver@@ last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she named a voters from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Mos@@ in ( R ) was also a visit of the AC@@ PI because of its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be as heavy .
at the time Wash@@ ing@@ tons had a similar effect like the Internet at affordable por@@ tos .
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied , between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brief@@ ing according to his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
&quot; people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers , the Wash@@ ing@@ tons decisions . &quot;
&quot; Peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with Great Britain , overcome his office , according to the historical documents , which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought them to the silence .
&quot; freedom of expression , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ course belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans Nr. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days on home comfort , because the Renaissance Club will be held in East Lot@@ hi@@ an the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led next door next door to the end of Arch@@ er@@ field , before he moved to Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new trade show , and acts as a tournament mess@@ enger on behalf of the association and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his glory , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best site , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry has made a great job when he set this place .
he is an un@@ free@@ zing of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; he is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as the European Challenge tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly about , &quot; said the in South@@ port heated players . &quot;
&quot; I have won &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it was in the year , after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year .
this event will be its first appearance since the Aber@@ deen asset management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can feel this additional pressure . &quot;
&quot; I really enjoyed it again , and I have played a solid Gulf . &quot;
I am happy about how it has gone .
&quot; with the trio at the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six fo@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
the entrance is free ; the car park costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ying and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants .
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ ary per@@ pen@@ ing through passive @-@ smoke
in the past two decades there are ever fewer people died because of passi@@ v@@ aged lung cancer .
this result showed researchers at the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates are per year 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cases on passi@@ vity , &quot; said Study Hei@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved one &apos;s own study on this topic from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there are still 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary cases of lung accidents per year in Germany . &quot;
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house@@ wife prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &apos; lying under the time &apos; , so the lad@@ der of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house@@ keeping is the situation more complicated than susp@@ ected , as the underground is much out@@ dated , which may not be noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which can always be hin@@ dered the construction works , represents a big problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the drivers in front of red lights and shut @-@ lock , is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are entitled to the passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy for weeks with working on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already quite nicely exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but luck@@ ily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold land
when Bar@@ dina is bo@@ asting the dinner cook@@ s when they do not use a stove .
it even uses rarely a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai govern@@ ement in the un@@ quiet ind@@ on@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually presents a conf@@ ection@@ ist - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
after half an hour the short@@ cut tu@@ bers will be extrac@@ ted with ei@@ gh@@ ten hands and distor@@ ted hands .
Deg@@ ei sits on the ground floor - it has no furniture - where they also perform their daily work , e.g. dres@@ ses with tr@@ ap water from the nearby sum@@ p to wash . &quot;
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ ch .
as the youngest of the four wives of their man they were not assigned any fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ ie is present here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are un@@ employed , and many drink heavy , and there are here the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; no one finds it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was founded in 1969 after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum in Indonesia as only 1,0@@ 26 el@@ dest by a public H@@ ander@@ ing before the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stands for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control over the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal observations of it . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 the province was officially divided in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with an independent part of Pap@@ ua @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning five @-@ hour drive with car rental .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the city with approximately 19.@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo and cor@@ rug@@ ated boxes , which were converted by r@@ ust in various yellow @-@ brown t@@ ints . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indonesian have made their trip here , wel@@ ded as journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
before Christian mission@@ aries betra@@ yed Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God named U@@ GA Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says de@@ ei and points to its bust@@ ling , hand @-@ beloved tur@@ ban , its dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves at our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is one of the poorest Province where 28 % of the people live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mortality rate in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian Gold land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ old in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has worth $ 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars and copper in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth a valued 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these rich@@ es are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua who ensure that Indonesian military is preserved an em@@ bro@@ ider@@ y presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local dairy farmers and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands for greater autonomy threat@@ ening this golden g@@ ans and are treated gr@@ ading .
&quot; according to activi@@ sts , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 from the Indonesian military . &quot;
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as Chief es@@ hoch@@ land in the 1970 @-@ 99 years have been issued under the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for gen@@ ocide .
&quot; in the region alone , Indonesian police last year more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we value the &quot; &quot; Every@@ one &quot; &quot; is stated in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Br@@ isb@@ ane from the year 2016 , in the reports of atro@@ cities in the previous year , such as un@@ law@@ ns and torture - r@@ ape and electro@@ des are particularly popular for a different report - and the brut@@ al precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since each week occurs , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ resear@@ cher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have intensified because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of settl@@ ers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the dem@@ ographic development changes , there is Muslim economies from the pop@@ ulated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ning @-@ cant@@ on sell chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ anu@@ t sauce . &quot;
local people fight for staying here .
&quot; the migrants began , ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua to sell , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , which moved to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua , costs their market . &quot;
&quot; Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the folk , and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and the legal violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total 29 areas of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential pal@@ ast in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; actually , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initiation in October a deep @-@ point . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the gri@@ pping children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took part in her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had dr@@ unk , hun@@ ted , and sm@@ ote the group with their conscience , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then fi@@ red one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so heavy be@@ aten that he fell into a comm@@ a . &quot;
a few hours later the building was set to the nearby government commission set in fire and the things escal@@ ate on the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football field before the local police station and the military com@@ mander centre to demand justice . &quot;
they tru@@ ff@@ em@@ oni@@ elle Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle ongoing and a bir@@ d@@ ang im@@ iti@@ sing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was infl@@ ated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are more than three times resist@@ or they shoot it dead , &quot; means it is not released in an official document of T@@ IME , which was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ p@@ ent danger , and called for rest and called the crowd going back home . &quot;
no one was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned me , I suddenly was shot into my left wr@@ ist wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the porch of his bun@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not , who broke out , but says that the ball came out of the rows of the band gathered together soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were folded , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was made three times , so his c@@ ous@@ in , the witness of the shooting was . &quot;
&quot; I burned to him and examined his body to go certain that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indonesian only one name , the T@@ IME in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the che@@ at@@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ por@@ ters that his officers &quot; wanted to secure their station &quot; , &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; the spok@@ es@@ man of the Pap@@ ua @-@ police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others have been in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks held Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for families of victims and sw@@ elled to address the historic ab@@ norm@@ alities of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case will immediately be resolved , so that it will no longer happen in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security Research Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he has a extr@@ ater@@ nal mechanism to assess historical violations of human rights violations .
but the pron@@ unci@@ ation began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injury are in a long time ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ ern and early the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that have to be passed through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then he made a retreat than he said on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME and said , he did not have plans in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , indic@@ ted the UN because of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ eke@@ eper blo@@ ody crimes in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua was already attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ t un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; I have fear , arrested by the military , have fear , shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was be@@ aten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ se , the army was looking for me , &quot; says he . &quot;
the shooting are not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma that ref@@ used to bring a unconscious man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were wo@@ unded , including children . &quot;
&quot; the husband , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , which was dr@@ unk , when he was in a nearby river fis@@ her , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
lifts of vill@@ agers in front of the site office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers were on the officers , which were re@@ acted upon it by warning . &quot;
but local people say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ il@@ it@@ ary police ) began to shoot the crowd and put a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will be reven@@ ge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who was close to the hospital house and witness to how the last here were delivered quickly , so the T@@ IME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to call the official officer to account and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been a glorious government for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bes@@ men Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , which live in the green highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel@@ lion , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by moving spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and de@@ duction of ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ em@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to that in recent years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and arbitr@@ ary in awareness , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safeguarding of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the bit rice , who is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ ation and fruits and leaf@@ y no@@ zzle .
agriculture is the task of women to edit the four or five fields of conf@@ ection@@ ery .
&quot; they retain the bulk of harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
ten pieces Not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities grew between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flu@@ ids .
&quot; the few jobs , which are in the region , are usually going to the better trained and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own business competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were portr@@ ayed because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is El@@ ections , the restrictions of reporting to raise transparency in order to promote transparency and development , not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesian un@@ quiet , eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ Ver@@ den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six pairs of Pacific - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ti@@ a , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ seln as well as the Sal@@ om@@ ones islands - the UN @-@ Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widely used injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the speaker of the Indonesian State Department Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dism@@ is@@ sed the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to shift the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people on site want foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human right mess@@ enger K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4th of May , H@@ ap@@ ura asked him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that would also participate in the session but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has 2019 to say another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that she probably will not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is involved by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that , is living under the constant threat of a peasant army , is located in arm@@ or educ@@ ators and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; consider that he has to rep@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intim@@ i@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai offering a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite , was buried in a terrain with the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never give justice to justice , but at least let them do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with soci@@ alizing head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ ers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai its passage and has hundreds of inhabitants , dating from 337 metres high , 79 @-@ stor@@ ey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that existed in just two years by the sky@@ scr@@ aper , that one is calling the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept on the cre@@ ws and the scre@@ ams of the people .
&quot; we burned the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to come down , told a habit@@ ant who has his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said , that the units of fire @-@ fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 am GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building was cool . &quot;
&quot; the government said , it work on the provision of accommodation for those concerned . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be used questions about security of materials , which are used in external areas of sky@@ scrap@@ ers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages from the fair@@ ing , the external cl@@ adding to the decoration , or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and fair@@ ing at the London Gren@@ il tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of an Bran@@ des , in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis court ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the general meeting .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h city , the reason for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was only supported on two pay@@ outs , Hau@@ ch@@ thin@@ im not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; that often very long , but even so much appreciated Five @-@ set @-@ classics remain the tray . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only barely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our member@@ ships will not have accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on to improve the application .
not only for the vote was by many in@@ spec@@ tions already before the proposal came to carry the finale at a neutral place .
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will continue in the first round the host law in the first round . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the costs of the organis@@ er , the requirements will be made available in training sessions etc and players will have to complete the Davis Cup less official media events before the Davis Cup Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US @-@ trav@@ eller , sp@@ ends objects into the plane , finds a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey under flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent are fully aware or un@@ aware of the US Transportation Security Administration pass , including at least 6 per cent , who betra@@ y the plane while they acci@@ dentally de@@ ed knife or other objects with blade . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent h@@ ew@@ ed , they had discovered that they have travelled ir@@ ons with sp@@ uss@@ ons , amm@@ unition or explosive . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the STR@@ ATOS Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , it was also fixed that younger travellers rather abuse the rules . &quot;
&quot; by the respon@@ dents , the en@@ cor@@ es that they are know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19,@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
the most common objects that have become apparent to T@@ SA agents were di@@ visible in foods and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 per cent don@@ ated to do , know@@ ingly items with blade by security control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents , and 3,@@ 7 percent of the male in@@ quired also confirmed that they would have de@@ duced drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , there are travelers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally were brought by the airport security , and how many could have done it . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that people who are at the most visited sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware - wis@@ ely or ignor@@ ant - by security carry those ones , those most often fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a little complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often un@@ certain that flu@@ ids they are allowed to take them or how much of it .
so there is no surprise that the largest quantity of the objects covered by the T@@ SA dr@@ au@@ ted objects .
&quot; for a time , the people , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware . &quot;
liquids are allowed on domestic flights however not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands Tes@@ la @-@ customers / Order
&quot; elec@@ tr@@ end@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k gives you the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far sub@@ ordin@@ ated that part of the customer has moved their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always tri@@ ump@@ hal@@ ic figures for sales growth and still gigantic sales aims Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k showed for the first time a different , less striking number : the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k had often ordered with the more than 500,000 orders for the new car , whose delivery is straight . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k is one : from the total of 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre @-@ orders have been returned 6@@ 3,000 already . &quot;
critics were always noted that there is only a non @-@ binding booking .
&quot; in a cancellation the Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pound ) &quot; booking confirmation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are before , spatial Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts . &quot;
&quot; that the cancellation of now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la leader does not believe . &quot;
its argument : the challenge to ambitious growth objectives lies not on demand but on the production site .
last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 cars delivered .
&quot; in 2018 , all models are taken together - 500@@ .000 to be one million . &quot;
the demand for this is evident .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations . &quot;
&quot; who today released a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; we must reck@@ on in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la it creates , his brand @-@ new , never even in practice tested production streets without greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum relief . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it is too big delays , then the in@@ viol@@ ability of reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then the company can not go un@@ satisfied customers in sc@@ ars , in sc@@ ars . &quot;
EP@@ A @-@ Chef Pru@@ itt will withdraw himself for the reduction of the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after spending was indic@@ ted by 15 states , Scott did , the boss of the environmental protection authority , his former decision returns to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g air@@ waste . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt presented the change , as his agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities towards re@@ activity faster than previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mentioned the law@@ suit against his previous place in the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to keep the standards of 2015 for down @-@ to @-@ floor zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , in June that he will delay the compliance with a year to study more time to study the plan and avoid the economic growth in local decisions . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ d@@ ged , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s prosec@@ ut@@ or of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , a long time was a reliable opponent on environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , Pru@@ d@@ ough has to be repeated , blo@@ cking or delay to block the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the Pru@@ ence Reg@@ ul@@ atory Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month a federal course in Washington decided that the EP@@ A car@@ et@@ aker has exc@@ eeded his authority as he tried to implement the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company for the surveillance and reduction of meth@@ an@@ lec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in one of the paper published paper , Pru@@ d@@ ged proposed that his turn@@ out at Oz@@ on@@ standards is simply the willingness of the EP@@ A to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely performance of the new standards strengthened . &quot;
&quot; under previous administration , the EP@@ A often did not viol@@ ate the deadlines for carrying out and then wa@@ ited from activi@@ sts groups and others , and agreed to an agreement reached the appointment for the execution , &quot; said Pru@@ d@@ der the EP@@ A more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take time seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless the opinion of the EP@@ A , that Pru@@ denti@@ tion will eventually take advantage of its &quot; powers to delay and all other legal measures made available , to ensure that the rules &quot; should be based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the Congress are pushing for a broader setting of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; a last month &apos;s bill , it is intended to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet made in the Senate .
&quot; the New York State Director Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who ruled the coalition of the States that had indic@@ ted the EP@@ A in this week , said the group intend to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EP@@ A - after our pl@@ agues - is an important prize for the health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans , which are directly affected by smo@@ g who are flowing in their municipalities . &quot;
&quot; new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; ground @-@ Oz@@ on arises , if poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil finishes , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere are responding to sunlight . &quot;
the standing tu@@ g can cause sensitive groups of people serious breath@@ s and contribute every year to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of the public health system and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered via Pru@@ ence surprisingly change of course .
&quot; it is wor@@ rying about how much pressure it takes to get this rational step by the person responsible for the protection of air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological Crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to stimulate environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celeb@@ rates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : at the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 . July , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. to a seren@@ ade . &quot;

Walter Mart@@ ini stres@@ ses : &quot; It is a unique villages . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ de@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in the Wür@@ t@@ tem@@ berger Ur@@ g@@ book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the re@@ membran@@ ce of tum@@ lingen , and the Vog@@ t Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the word of judgment , according to the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the church parish was also a magnificent farm , to which the church or the patron saint belon@@ ged to the church , and not vice versa . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as seen from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the village of tum@@ ours , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , of the glorious settl@@ ers of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around 1600 under@@ lined this historical situation .
the pat@@ ron@@ al Law came from the early medieval peculi@@ arity .
&quot; a Lord , which built a church built and worked with a past@@ or , remain owner of this church and could also destroy this peculi@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to use a past@@ or or to propose a new priest to the bishop . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two zer@@ bar@@ st on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created glo@@ ck sail@@ ed then for the first time 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows are pushed and the bells were st@@ olen .
the roof was im@@ tight .

they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
remains of the Church threatened by 18@@ 09 .
until the 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as last retirement for the dead from hearing .
18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ de@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the church tower allowed to be .
in the New Year &apos;s eight 18@@ 34 sp@@ elled a storm the church tower and half thre@@ w .
to prevent a hurt of the tower became the tower broken .
only today still available tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained intact as a witness of the 750 years old church .

society wants to check availability of bicycles
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim watches himself &quot; does not see any legal pre@@ condition for the construction and therefore has turned to the land of land .
&quot; the Association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; has been instruc@@ ted &quot; Land@@ mark Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) encouraged to increase its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association was argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , at all , no wind turbines would have been approved as at the time in Vier@@ sen only on the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind power concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the concentr@@ ating zone does not include an exclusion of wind @-@ use for the remaining city area . &quot;
&quot; these zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; reduction &quot; &quot; landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but had not approved the District government in Düsseldorf , because of a string . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning and legal requirement , the appro@@ vals hum@@ id is still un@@ law@@ ful and therefore also with@@ drawn , &quot; said Christopher Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot;
&quot; current status of the things : the town stood before the summer break again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ets decided ; a permit of the District government is still standing . &quot;
Er@@ kens : &quot; this is the basis that the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded .
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; the corresponding writing are made for last week at the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; stated a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes them on the occasion to consider the matter once again .
&quot; however , they do not expect that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to deal with regard to the arg@@ um@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
&quot; NEW Re , an affiliate of NEW , plans to build a surface at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette construction of four each 200 meters high wind bikes . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company had involved in which the city quarters is involved , p@@ aired contracts with the owner of approximately 65 acres of great nest . &quot;
with the establishment of four wind turbines the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered - this is equivalent to some of one fifth of the power demand of all four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the last summer of summer there was green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a stake in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .

Tru@@ mp set after sear@@ ched tran@@ scription by telephone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription by phone call between U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp and Le@@ aders from Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January Tru@@ mp requested Tru@@ mp in a telephone call with the Mexican presidency En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , publicly to say that he would not pay for an planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. president cri@@ ed him , because he had denied the Wall publicly . say , he said to him , &quot; &quot; this cannot say the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern edge of the USA , and schw@@ or , Mexico for the project will be charged . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first inv@@ itations with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees who went to Australia to assume , &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; , &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; du@@ mm &quot; , &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; , &quot; after being proposed by the Government Obama , after he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp be@@ ended the call , after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ mass@@ ac@@ re : activi@@ sts lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercur@@ y was driving through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and ru@@ mp@@ ed to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider had to reach the bridge , a group of wh@@ er men came out with thread to block its path . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man middle age in a needle @-@ strip - took a long train at its c@@ ig@@ ar and looked after veri@@ fi@@ red by the wind@@ shield .
inside the we@@ eds the in@@ m@@ ates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; br@@ aces of the man . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; cry cr@@ acks the silence , as a young black man from the passenger seat was destroyed . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , just a reference . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck by &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all in the audience are very real sig@@ h . &quot;
since 2005 civil rights to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge went back to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever indic@@ ted because of the murder .
&quot; it really is in@@ concei@@ vable that in all these years was not a single person arrested - although we know them in our congreg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ r@@ one Brook@@ s , which helps in the organization of retro@@ fit . &quot;
&quot; it is a strainer on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . &quot;
Brook@@ s is a 71 @-@ year @-@ year former congresses of the state of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
&quot; for him , the delivery as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community , that an Un@@ right has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosec@@ ution , we want the ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a Angel Medicine presents a bed @-@ ro@@ ud on the corp@@ ses of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding county will susp@@ ected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades , citizenship rights that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions around the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision to the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , at the anticip@@ ation in summer their voice . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the election of the F@@ BI of the Black Far@@ mp@@ ans Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owners , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - suppos@@ edly due to a woman . &quot;
&quot; Brook@@ s said , the righteous in the city have been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy , and that the baby , which she carried , not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owners , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her C@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when they removed from the prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge lights , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b took the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turned out , it was Har@@ rison that the Mor@@ de has been prepared and arranged , includes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was an agreement between state and local criminal proceedings , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot;
Brook@@ s it form@@ ulates it as well .
&quot; it was an el@@ ectoral mass@@ ac@@ re , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community , &quot; &quot; if you register yourself and when you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade of long Cass@@ andra has led Gre@@ ene the annual descendants of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is vivi@@ dly , and is founded in a kind of deep racism , from which many believe he has no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to ga@@ ze , and yet more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ ne because we then are confronted with its h@@ ug@@ hness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I did . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen wheat and the rest Black - in a space and lou@@ der , as Gre@@ ene launched a well @-@ split overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ase Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ s for years , but he said , the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to preserve this story in life , because we would not return to those times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona to play the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester qu@@ ake and it sho@@ cked , angry that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , s@@ win@@ ed of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ ects the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh at loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ h . &quot;
I don &apos;t think white people then &apos; n &apos; n &apos; n &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ zel@@ te , one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos;@@ R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and it is precisely because the energy in the room , a sense of compan@@ ionship re@@ places the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this correctly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four @-@ killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with post @-@ pressure . &quot;
absolutely no man laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is dre@@ y , kis@@ ses and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , with a dream @-@ dress dres@@ sed , stands above the corp@@ ses of the actor and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays trau@@ ern@@ de Lob@@ ster &quot; Str@@ ange Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks each second word .
about hundred metres behind it there is a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators and t@@ ears from the eyes .
the audience is almost simultaneous between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many are just down the road . &quot;
&quot; they have seen all nearly eight hours of Georgi@@ ou@@ dy Hum@@ idity , if Brook@@ s carries them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point the Mor@@ de have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de , the air feels fed . &quot;
&quot; if the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites you to come closer and to insp@@ ecting the corp@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken with their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and bre@@ ast@@ feeding bodies and wh@@ is@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ dering a small boy , when it wants to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes thanks Gre@@ ene the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l weg and w@@ ish their t@@ ears .
&quot; Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the move , who has played the cursor . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks down in their arms together with the emotional load of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; wh@@ is@@ sing one of women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience will get together with the actors for dinner together . &quot;
at a table pl@@ unge a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulated over the after@@ adjustment with a black pair that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought therefore to find words which leave the feeling of performance .
&quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who like yourself and those who do , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what that really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ n still falls , &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; today , it is called the only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ r@@ one Brook@@ s Hof at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds us of the citizens &apos; rights . &quot;
&quot; he said , he already started to plan the performance in the next year . &quot;
&quot; the rep@@ ay@@ ment is inspiring in a certain way , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; who does not study his own story , who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &apos; , the wag@@ ons in Bay@@ re@@ uth &quot;
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental works puts the director Frank Cast@@ orf on a color@@ fully @-@ free@@ zing against gigantic , six @-@ stor@@ ey scenery . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ ming ( shaped by Alek@@ san@@ dar Den@@ ic ) shows either a ash@@ amed road with a wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; &quot; logo of the GDR or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before it par@@ ked an open Mercedes @-@ vintage car , in which the Rhine is pos@@ ing than Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stu@@ ff@@ ed oil @-@ drums remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that draws himself through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ k@@ chter - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they run Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , t@@ ren in Hollywood Man@@ or a corp@@ se into the trunk @-@ room and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious fi@@ bers who surrounds the au@@ ra of a sword box@@ er .
brut@@ al the scene as he defe@@ ats Sieg@@ fried .
later one has to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus Ei@@ che ) dr@@ an .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; turbul@@ ent are celebrated F@@ ost@@ er , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Di@@ rig@@ ent Jan@@ owski , which is modest , and the hands to the Merkel @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; big appl@@ ause is available for the play@@ site , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the big heat again into leg@@ is@@ cop@@ ing clothes . &quot;
with tension was anticipated the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ ent arrow concert on himself , there were five years later great che@@ ers in which the &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; went . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; one noted that the audience grew by the &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its perspective . &quot;
I draw a positive res@@ ili@@ ation .

&quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum which I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; now you are 26 years , therefore a late volunteer volunteer . &quot;
how does that come ?
quantity : I did Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a construction studies , we say once again successfully . &quot;
&quot; I have known for me , that it is for me the wrong and I want to do something else , with people working . &quot;
and then I ask myself what you do .
&quot; a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the burning point also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will continue to study , I probably do at the Ju@@ gen@@ da@@ mt Her@@ ne a social worker training and study at Ham@@ m at Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer services ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it probably comes along where you can be F@@ SJ .
it is possible to do it from Al@@ ter@@ sheim to the youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social labour .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was in part in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ care service . &quot;
for me this was exactly the right thing as it ass@@ ed me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really dis@@ solved .
unlike in engineering studies ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
one has over and over again other people in front of the heads which each have a different story behind him .
&quot; whether a refuge@@ e , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been r@@ alled from the family - one always has to take into account . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have touched ?
amount : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a much .
&quot; great love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so is life . &quot;
Pear@@ son abbrevi@@ ated further 3,000 jobs and cut divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their mid@@ divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be started to overcome pressure with which the company is confronted . &quot;
&quot; the job @-@ making , the General Director of John Fall@@ on is mainly announced by the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019 , in addition to his previous restructuring , in which already 4,000 places were lost . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program for more than 300 million pounds ( 394 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business , which was hit by a fast step to digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which expressed its participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged after it achiev@@ es an increase of 1 per cent to 2.@@ 05 billion pound in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier at sel@@ f@@ ord@@ an@@ schlag
&quot; a self @-@ board ship has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldier of N@@ ato killed and several others in@@ ju@@ red , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and a interpre@@ ter may have been viol@@ ated an explanation of N@@ ato .
confirmed local reports according to the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district also three civilians .
the bom@@ bing mission is the last one @-@ force that Afghanistan met this month - on Tuesday they were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday t@@ uns a self @-@ extrac@@ tor two people near the Ira@@ qi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of the N@@ ato it is called , the blast on Thursday night will happen , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; shared Impro@@ vised Spr@@ inkl@@ es &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement said that all of these last in a stable state are in a stable state and in the U.S. military service on the field of Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called &quot; Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a big concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civil deaths , of which about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
at the end of July a su@@ ic@@ ide @-@ Autob@@ om@@ be at least 30 people in a former Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a tremendous bom@@ bing in the centre of the city has more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ guided troops in 2001 the Taliban of power has been betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US @-@ president Donald Tru@@ mp ab@@ ects , the number of US troops , who support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ ic@@ ide attacks in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EP@@ A returns a decision for del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule after Kl@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. american environmental protection has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , which are oblig@@ ated , which are committed to smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states used the agency because of a ped@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ A announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ation &quot; &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency , co @-@ operate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EP@@ A @-@ Chef Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , the intention of the EP@@ A announced the intention of the EP@@ A to be measured in which in a part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions to determine where in@@ cuts must be taken to delay in ti@@ ghter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the District of Colombia , filed on Tuesday and said that the endeav@@ ors is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to pass a wide range of environmental issues that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a wider agenda , which should boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp &apos;s economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the back of Democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ A website implies that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and can reinforce the breath@@ able symp@@ tom symptoms , as for example as@@ thma . &quot;
municipalities wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clearly : with two oppos@@ ites the coun@@ cill@@ or of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln up the establishment of a common meeting in the future wall residence . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land@@ piece was signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it will still take place until now the Church has been settled in the community &apos;s community , but there is now no planning for the project by a private investor to st@@ em@@ ating project . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is a discussion concerning a common area . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , who still are in the boat , has offered to meet the municipality . &quot;
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council p@@ ending , such a common room is not as a meeting place only for the residents of the sen@@ tim@@ ed residence , but open to the congregation . &quot;
&quot; an example made the word from &quot; &quot; kn@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; the round . &quot;
&quot; reconc@@ iling the decision , which has been decided by providing means for the current household already in the last autumn , through funding options . &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , so reported T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent reduction by 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision considers the investor to signal to the investor that one wants to throw him in this respect no knot@@ ting between the legs - as well as P@@ ult@@ da@@ ch - which makes it possible , and the construction of economic power - as well as possible . &quot;
&quot; unnecessary , so does not only mean Wil@@ fried So@@ h@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive . &quot;
if it helps : un@@ anim@@ ous happens to the body .
not so easy it goes to the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which you are not so quite pro@@ gres@@ sing at the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I do so hard with it . &quot;
Yv@@ onne Sta@@ iger is definitely talking about the common room - but absolutely against a municipal .
it is behind it an im@@ min@@ ent in@@ vention in any case @-@ like or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you give no grant , but get a real , in the branch of doubt , is the counter @-@ title . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , the decision applied accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains in two oppos@@ ing the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ izing : &quot; when we summar@@ ise the decision , we make a giant step to close a giant step in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : Rad@@ ler is pushed onto street
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath is recorded by a car and badly in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;

FC Bayern München must ref@@ rain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without it instead : David Al@@ aba must be the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with recruitment , the FC Bayern become the first mandatory game of the new season to Dortmund . &quot;

Trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ref@@ rain from the du@@ el with the BV@@ B also to David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; moreover , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six trials , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; this was not least good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believe in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intensified match &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of both German football @-@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
the game is sold with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spect@@ ators distributed the German football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday with .
hiking in the resin from Stern to Stern
in the resin the nationwide first &quot; star@@ ch path &quot; is meant to be developed .
this is planning the association observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a Plan@@ eten@@ weg trail in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; star &quot; star@@ ch &quot; &quot; of the information needs of many har@@ p @-@ visits , was called it . &quot;
&quot; he Conn@@ ecting nature , science , exercise and sporting performance . &quot;
members want to place tables along the planned route and inform on stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ reaching facilities at five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
information on the boards are to be suppl@@ emented by internet .
this is why a good mobile net @-@ reception plays a role in the sit@@ ing election .
also accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star trail is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the constell@@ ation ad experience the viewer &apos;s much information about , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they met why stars would have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ aire than another , although he essentially further away . &quot;
&quot; it will also be taught in which constell@@ ation is a selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has already been running in the mountain city of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the most located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 . &quot;
the location in the middle of the national park resin counts according to the details of the Federal Minister for Nature Conservation to the six Dark Regions in Germany .
frequently are from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with mere eye to see .
since 2003 the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen has something similar to the planned Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g - Plan@@ eten@@ weg .
&quot; starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee , which represents the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ eten@@ weg path leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Municip@@ al equ@@ als ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the st@@ ables with the individual planet - including the d@@ ded degra@@ dation Pl@@ uto on the end@@ point - are exactly positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ unk so on a sphere of 6.5 millimeters diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away the sun is at least 70 cen@@ timeters . &quot;
the whole distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers .
&quot; during the light of the sun until the Pl@@ uto takes about eight hours , ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ems with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed @-@ star but would still last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision in the near future among 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ ted World Box@@ ing Council , lightweight champion , the cor@@ ridor , to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through an un@@ anim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions @-@ world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at show@@ time are both fighters members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stre@@ amed the right hand and said , &quot; How is it to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko defended his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Satur@@ days evening at 19 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple for photos posi@@ erte , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ m , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have asc@@ ended for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run on light weight .
and he must move on Light@@ weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
we demand the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ ma asked if it should fight to pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ enko to arrange a date in order to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after the lightweight championship in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him , said Gar@@ cia and drag@@ ged down later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names may generate this type of attention .
when always they are prepared ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he cher@@ ish Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous figh@@ ter , &quot; and he will possibly take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko stopped at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the tri@@ ck@@ ery champion from River@@ side see &quot; very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you really want the co @-@ end . &quot;
&quot; cia said , the focus is to show stroke thickness , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; they said , they could feel the Mom@@ entum , which was up for the own battle . &quot;
&quot; this is the fight that has to be carried out . &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I wa@@ ited to the top fighters and that is Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four last after tire @-@ space
during an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon four people were in@@ ju@@ red to part .
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.30 clock shortly before the connecting market , probably after a tire @-@ place control over his vehicle . &quot;
the passenger moved to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he suggested and then remained on the roof of the sh@@ ro@@ am .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were in@@ ju@@ red during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the last through the lif@@ ebo@@ at service , the A7 was locked in the north for about one hour , then the traffic could be initiated on the left @-@ stri@@ pe at the p@@ outs . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; dirt chain work better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann , after the 2 : 2 to the season pr@@ el@@ ude against Braunschweig , that brings the optimization of def@@ enses in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season was Andre Hoffmann , with the result , would not be the two oppos@@ ore at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ore too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Ore Mountains the dirt chain is also to be optimized further .
and a gate after an exemp@@ le of the For@@ tun@@ es want to be the For@@ tun@@ es also no more .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no more in addition to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is even better after the experiences in preparing with the dirt chain , than with the quad@@ rup@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; nor do I know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helmet Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is its cause sure , &quot; &quot; because we just got to build a half way to the half @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gi@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can do well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the requirement is , however , that we do even better harmon@@ ize with us and we do not afford to make a lot of de@@ clin@@ ing errors . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; whether one can speak according to a decre@@ asing of a mis@@ sive start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the Pok@@ al , we will surely speak of a decent season . &quot;
of which his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season I have only after six to eight players , &quot; said Fried@@ helmet Funk@@ el , which did not speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abandoned due to an un@@ weather . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season practically start with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e might be even something fresh , as they could not have he@@ avier and complete play as Fortuna against a climb in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 @-@ process , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the def@@ enders of the Fortuna . &quot;
&quot; while the guests get off the Rhin@@ eland as easier favorite on Sunday , at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is b@@ ati@@ ling , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games very positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga that you have to hit by pre@@ matur@@ ely , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Ch@@ ef@@ coach . &quot;
such a statement to meet would be arro@@ gan@@ t and adul@@ tery .
and so he wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results published by the Swedish asylum seek@@ ers tests
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden has under@@ gone a new method for the medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of those tested people were older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ical medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ medi@@ cin@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the execution of tests last year .
&quot; they shall make the assessment of the age of more accurately during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration flows ( migration ) because of errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; until today , it has been ma@@ iled 6.@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eight@@ y percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency told that the person has been 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the person is posed to question .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are resistant in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we see no major difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person has been assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has weigh@@ ed over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to propose , the &quot; propose person 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det had been resear@@ ched the 5@@ 81 results , she presented that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that they become old in this year 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical evaluation assessment , made in the x @-@ rays of wisdom , and MR@@ T @-@ shots of Kni@@ ves , which then be analyzed from dental clinics and radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed in some fields . &quot;
&quot; a sc@@ ep@@ tic is the end of the endo@@ cr@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose job includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
the biological age of this way to judge is very ins@@ ec@@ ure .
&quot; if we cannot say it is not sure , we should not do as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ c@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult un@@ correct . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is in it if the person is barely under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well ahead .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of emphasis was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it is great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ eicht , construction leader in the Department of Applied Sciences and Transport in the Res@@ um@@ dium Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work started at the same time on all three sandy beach bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is planned for October and E@@ asi@@ ly is sure that the timing is respected .
&quot; the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge of concrete , which is dres@@ sed with red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein , and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
built in the year 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , she has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thorough . &quot;
the two other bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were er@@ ected in 1939 and are twelve , and respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow on the north side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so called bread@@ cap .
this is a side attachment that is also used as a run@@ way .
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge is to be used on Friday a bub@@ ble width .
it should then run the pedestrian path .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented brack@@ ets .
special finger@@ tips has to set the wir@@ es by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; for there is also a glass fiber , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed in advance of works by hand@@ some about the project .
&quot; in addition , first fish and cr@@ abs had to be deduc@@ ted at first . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building of the building and the collection in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work at the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher Local entrance , the road is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three rolls are around 700 000 Euro .
financed the whole through the land .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Prot@@ est at German pot@@ ato salad
&quot; it does not come so frequently that parties go to a Str@@ ang , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes along , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows on this day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell &quot; invites to the poster of the great el@@ ectoral process . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which is together with Alexander Gau@@ land the leading duo for the German Bundestag on 24 September , and the vice @-@ Chairman of the Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ for@@ kli@@ fts , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally planned the town of picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the fountain place , but now on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the sight of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that has to offer .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum One World and one of the leading organizers , really happy : &quot; great how many people came here together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German pot@@ ato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ es without problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who has brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police has be@@ amed many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in front of all the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D had actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ p Vul@@ can@@ ei@@ fel reported that he stri@@ ves for such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked him in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes no enough parking is available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ del , Hom@@ pes is pleased that we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; looking at the event on the Ron@@ da square , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : against 8 pm on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ Chair Uwe boy . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners that await the Spit@@ s@@ andi@@ da@@ tin for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ Chairman of the Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presented , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can be back - no special occurr@@ ences .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re @-@ hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ tor@@ te tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the Kloster@@ kirche . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian Tromp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; Black Sea , &quot; &quot; or even &quot; &quot; Balk@@ an@@ fol@@ klore &quot; &quot; or even &quot; &quot; Balk@@ an@@ fol@@ klore &quot; &quot; for a classical German training with roots in b@@ low@@ music . &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have n@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European clim@@ atic priests .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire to cross , not only the borders on their instruments , but also merge the limits of the different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines himself with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece of &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ ri@@ pper N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram , mix classic , jazz and the free games to an intrigu@@ ing total figure . &quot;
this core piece of the program was performed only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram has written it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with her special acou@@ sti@@ cs will deliber@@ ately be involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art speaks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people gr@@ illed cheese and will eat him to the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything out , so Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art very openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I joined cheese once in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next to next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of the Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ stars was the &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which eventually arose bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all this ass@@ ures the br@@ ün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ er opposite the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was seriously temp@@ ted that I have liked . &quot;
&quot; or believe you about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; according to their separation , Kri@@ sten was saying that they were bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them took her loud &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; but in the school time , when they prefer to be like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; when I was eleven told me the kids , I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
I really felt attacked and damaged .
&quot; now I show back and think of me , &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to live their love @-@ life : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and that anno@@ yed me .
&quot; and perhaps some call me to be und@@ ill@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the general public . &quot;
govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thurs@@ days with a manifestation with President Tru@@ mp , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and much thinking ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I cannot help you if I am a democratic govern@@ or . &quot;
the r@@ ally broke out in che@@ ers .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a coach I would say that it is at the time to play a different game .
Mr. Tru@@ mp spoke before a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice endor@@ sed not the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , the loud For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was selected 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes firmly believes that he possesses Koh@@ l@@ ems in five states , and from his father a carbon business . &quot;
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday stagn@@ ation a statement in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party who would rather s@@ ed@@ ed us as to work in order to make our country again great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice , the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership is and not able to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , said the R@@ NC @-@ chair of R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the CB@@ S News . &quot;
&quot; coaching &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for doping @-@ scan@@ dal &quot;
&quot; the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ised on Thursday , which he described as an open dis@@ ap@@ ologies from Russia to a mental scan@@ dal , but he re@@ peti@@ tive , it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport . &quot;
Russia Ath@@ le@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the I@@ A@@ AF congress at the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he decided to fight the mental doping .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , those in cont@@ ests of gold and silver medals were cut . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments voted the I@@ A@@ AF congress for the maintenance of the Forbidden , which was published in November 2015 , after a report of the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency ( W@@ ada ) evidence of state @-@ being sponsored by Russia in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was today a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said I@@ A@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the Repor@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced himself at itself , that she has experienced some pretty hot times and everything can do to make sure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said , he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to commit Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean Ath@@ l@@ ete from the wast@@ ed system , &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes on the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships which begin on Friday in London according to the strict I@@ A@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors .
&quot; the head of the I@@ A@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still fulfill some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate , and betra@@ yed trainers are still free , he said re@@ por@@ ters in London after a presentation at the I@@ A@@ AF Council . &quot;

at noon first only the members of the church were far@@ ewell .
&quot; after that , the trau@@ mas party began in the circle of the family , eng@@ ster friends , by representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;

prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be best@@ owed by his wife in addition to his wife . &quot;
this distributed the Royal House on Thursday with .

but he did not have the intention to teach in his French homeland .
prince Hen@@ rik had never made a fl@@ our that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have been king .
in 2016 he went to retirement and also places the title &quot; prin@@ cess . &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted to see himself from his wife , not as equal to the death , explained L@@ ene Ball@@ eby , the Ch@@ ef@@ speaking of the Danish royal house . &quot;

&quot; in an auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I was doing , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk @-@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and those who had the reputation to be the brand of Social intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ash@@ amed me .
these were the same two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; defe@@ ated Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green regul@@ arity for a swift re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to return . &quot;
&quot; because of the resolution of the Parliament , it spoke on Friday for the resolution of the parliament . &quot;
previously the surprising Austr@@ o @-@ Gre@@ etings from her land@@ fall in Lower Saxony the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) had stopped in a difficult crisis .
&quot; five months before the official appointment of the country @-@ day elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover thus lost its scar@@ ce a @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green @-@ MP El@@ ke Tw@@ ist justified its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future at the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ action sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to absor@@ b them .
&quot; thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had found 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on land , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was vice versa .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green provincial government now decide whether they can go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l keeps it essential for un@@ essential that the land@@ day decides as rapidly as its self @-@ redemption . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday through its course of action .
&quot; the state of the provincial , also provides the possibility that the govern@@ ors to the prime minister has reli@@ ed the trust and choose a successor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be checked legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; it will be discussed in peace all questions , if they are legally binding . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler n@@ ursed T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something cur@@ i@@ os .
the politicians even stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
they are referred to as a tr@@ ailers of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the de@@ ath@@ l@@ ete member for the return of their country house .
&quot; we of course go out that she has received her country @-@ day , which has preserved over the green country , with immediate effect , shared by the provincial Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the Group Leader of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; we de@@ pl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke Tw@@ ist .
they have deliber@@ ately decided to address any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; in front of the background , there was no content differences , we cannot process this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ Regist@@ ering Martin Schulz strongly condem@@ ns the passage of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ Members El@@ ke Tw@@ ests to the CD@@ U as betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behavior of the former Gre@@ ens MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al at the voters and voters , but also wrote on Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly select the land@@ day . &quot;
the leaving T@@ West costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politicians imagine &quot; &quot; in its ver@@ final van@@ ity and in her fru@@ stration their personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; he critic@@ ised the Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus . &quot;
&quot; it is a scan@@ dal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this narrow indu@@ ce game and try to hit the political capital . &quot;
&quot; defe@@ ats CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ action sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members , El@@ ke Tw@@ ests to the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; the SPD of the SPD by the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , appointed Tw@@ ist , with personalised care@@ ers the result of the country @-@ election in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time before the SPD &apos;s strongest force , SPD and Green had an ins@@ ult majority of one voice in the country . &quot;
&quot; land ins in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gi@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany are discussing about si@@ gh@@ ed eggs .
how could the scan@@ dal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Land@@ scape S@@ ister Christian Schmidt ( C@@ SU ) stands in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt - How can the consumer protect themselves from det@@ oxi@@ fication ?
I can only encourage all consumer consumers and consumers to watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
the Bundes@@ wehr portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ .com represent the most recent information about the affected Eg@@ gs .
affected Eg@@ gs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now , Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis of crisis - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clear@@ er of the federal government is not really noticed ? &quot;
food monitoring is the task of the Bundesländer .
&quot; despite this , my house was immediately out@@ dated and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries for announ@@ cements . &quot;
all information and the risk assessment are available to the consumer .
&quot; the trade has just as much as the manufacturer to worry about that the sold products are capable and health@@ ful , harmless . &quot;
if in case of withdrawal of low @-@ resistance from 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg exc@@ eeded those are not allowed .
however eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the companies to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the head@@ lines , the production of companies has no immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must be due to mut@@ ally illegal practices of service companies with economic damage . &quot;
as always there is too little check@@ ers .
does it only be missing on the personal or in the en@@ code jurisdiction ?
there were precisely the am@@ mat@@ ory controls that revealed the process .
&quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be removed from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent clarification of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ or in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made multiple times that I expect from the responsible authorities to ensure seamless education .
is the regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and traffic @-@ efficient food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved ins@@ ecti@@ cide in the food sector is used , consumer consumers and consumers are too sc@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; by the pan@@ ed means , manufacturer , traders and consumers in a situation is not necessary , which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the ins@@ ecti@@ cide fi@@ bl@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ driven animals is not acceptable and must be immediately termin@@ ated . &quot;
it must be consistently used on all levels and work with high pressure .
&quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the atomic fact is rapidly approaching and complete . &quot;
how to impact the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent unauthorized issues of European football , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A still , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has control power , cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which have been launched by the UEF@@ A to life , mean that PS@@ G will eventually prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar without major losses has been financed . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million US $ ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar is received a sal@@ ary that will be several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make sure to make money loose with it N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him into an gal@@ axy of other stars ; given the financing of the team through the power of the rich mist@@ scher@@ family of Qatar .
&quot; we may use a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be controlled with legitimate income sources , which allow them to satisfy the Bre@@ ak @-@ E@@ ven point in terms of football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini according to his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French players believed that compar@@ isons had taken enormous debt to their pursuit of success , effectively decei@@ ve and ris@@ ky to ruin themselves when banks or owners have their support back . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shif@@ ted from concentration on the debt of clubs to supervision of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the amend@@ ment meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used 2003 in Chelsea , - a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested to build the crew and establish a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P pre@@ payment period , which will run until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million Euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini had fallen from the presidency in Un@@ mer@@ ade , his UEF@@ A @-@ successor Alek@@ s@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to cry out of excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a p@@ auses , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed up a five @-@ year contract for the next five years in the amount of 44,@@ 4 million euros during the yearly @-@ leaving certificate .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 held the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
the PS@@ G received a value of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the Mann@@ en@@ ts members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players will remain limited to normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs which could attempt to over@@ list their financial benefits by connecting their income by companies who are connected to the owners of a club .
&quot; during a cat@@ ar@@ ish company the PS@@ G spon@@ ges , if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market sets , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; precisely this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsorship of the P@@ SA was se@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar about payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 could occur in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have been disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar WM @-@ amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be easy to find and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G will mean that the UEF@@ A will not be attentive to note the rules .
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ made talks with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , f@@ ted on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they said under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press since they were not fu@@ ged to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 .
the accounts for the last fiscal year will have to be released .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and trig@@ gers . &quot;
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent increase .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly ir@@ ri@@ ted to see one of the best so@@ ccer players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s path to hurt them that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial doping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily newspaper AS relating to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , the reservations are financed by La Liga against a state , which financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner , and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because you have different ways or have different interests , if a country has a great player to represent a country . &quot;

&quot; Swiss @-@ speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the News Agency SD@@ A , a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ thr@@ h@@ z &quot; from Friday . &quot;
according to current planning the Air@@ line will join a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked for every two to three years and under@@ gone a quality control .
&quot; with the current suppliers Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very happy , &quot; said the spok@@ es@@ person . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small rot@@ ates packed ch@@ og@@ ram to 14 grams per year , the flight companion from the landing to the passengers . &quot;
over the costs Swiss does not want to make statements .
&quot; industry sectors appreciate the volume according to &quot; Nor@@ thr@@ ong &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; however , more important is all@@ em@@ al of the advertising effects : for a ch@@ og@@ gi@@ producer , it is a prestigious order . &quot;
&quot; how many applicants are in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y Swiss . &quot;
but in question only Swiss manufacturers .
&quot; according to the review , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the contract in the spring 2018 . &quot;
for the SD@@ A the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer has not been accessible for an opinion .
chocolate boards distri@@ butes Swiss since 2006 on board its flights .
&quot; before Swiss Life concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Call@@ eb@@ aut had delivered in collaboration with H@@ ug the chocolate tablets . &quot;
the possibility to place the logo that resulted in Swiss and a half years with the start of cooperation with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss Chocol@@ ats together .
&quot; the customers of First Class with treats will be spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ her Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class Na@@ og@@ gi from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; also on the short circuit , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi from Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , both in the business and economy class . &quot;
Ath@@ le@@ tics - Dis@@ cus @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Robert Hart@@ ing reaches WM @-@ Fin@@ als
the dre@@ ary World Champion is fighting on Saturday in the final for a medal .
&quot; his brother Christoph , Olympi@@ asi@@ eger from 2016 , was failed in the National World Cup race and could only look at the disc@@ us competition , only from the ble@@ achers . &quot;

no@@ stal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is simultaneously no@@ stal@@ gic because of the glorious days of characters of the 80 @-@ er @-@ era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ ers the Sk@@ etch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV sets ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be short . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; worked surprising good , not just because of his absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a speaking D@@ ose vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by playing on the core of the grid - actor middle ages play parts of children , which are grown up - they still managed to win the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the whale . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , with his adults , which is now playing adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more after the robot &apos;s principle , including a reef on the stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks &quot; ( &quot; The hand that illustr@@ ates the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; on a point a character obtained by an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gr@@ acious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not yet forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is still another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious P@@ lot to be included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ old ) which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the ex@@ classes of the best part of the fran@@ chise .
&quot; it is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ avi@@ lions of &quot; sing@@ les &quot; shows , the former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy himself feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of accidental mad@@ ness that could get this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieved what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; whose last scene will show the gang &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; now reminds us of a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; at the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ against @-@ West Ring O@@ GRA@@ PH@@ IE . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ewood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka @-@ created com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , an discovered TV series with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , which fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marxism . &quot;
the main bre@@ ast@@ feeding - a hard gr@@ ot@@ rop@@ y and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ si@@ c J@@ R. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon sein level in English .
it is a genius idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look ( the police move the time to watch chess on television as Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ ersh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ n &apos; voice out &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ thful propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer that carries a Re@@ agan mask , it is often included - that it is often like a single one . &quot;
&quot; in six long episodes , it draws up , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who has been re@@ arranged to a lower length could provide his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ s@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two di@@ spar@@ ing men which became a bunch of Hamburg . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that the Western culture can make everything for a v@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creator are not false : we even make it even with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; at the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ mor@@ nings , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar @-@ district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Esslingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were sear@@ ched , such as the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday afternoon . &quot;
15 Agre@@ ements were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and already ar@@ rest the ar@@ rest warran@@ t against them .
&quot; in addition , the officials created greater amounts of mari@@ juana and Kok@@ ain , s@@ uss@@ ons , and several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same Raz@@ or in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two other Italian Itali@@ ans there were German ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
the two are therefore pres@@ um@@ ably delivered to Germany .
at the action were the Italian and Bay@@ erische Er@@ mitt@@ ler .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia will be organised drug crime , heavy violence , tried , tried , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mailing . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ ut@@ or @-@ relationship with the organised drug dealers in the south @-@ German space . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ ut@@ ations in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a recur@@ ger exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Grand@@ use of the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
at the visor of the investigations there were mainly Italian nation@@ als with respect to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
&quot; also a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fin@@ gen , where early in the morning several shots were left into a guest house , is likely to go to the account of the gang . &quot;
mode for large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data of citizens who do not arise out there , &quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner @-@ register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
the lead to partly engra@@ ved mis@@ choices in asylum procedure .
&quot; the applic@@ ant for the refuge@@ e management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Way , has gained attention to large gaps in the out@@ cent@@ ric register . &quot;
&quot; defic@@ ien@@ cies in the recorded data could lead to asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; to partly engra@@ ved mis@@ choices , &quot; war@@ ned in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the register there are ten million people with foreign citizenship , including about 5.5 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is managed by approximately 600 foreigners authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data had not been adequ@@ ately maintained , the data quality in parts have not been good . &quot;
&quot; in some cases the data of 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long since become more of life , or of citizens who have become German citizens , and in the register no longer should arise . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data inputs can slow@@ down considerably , it is called the report to further . &quot;
&quot; in statistics of wellness @-@ free people , the EU citizens must not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; such false assign@@ ments led , but &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate about dealing with reis@@ ep@@ f@@ ty , &quot; it is called dem@@ ise in analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the German government has obviously begun to return to Italy , to return to Italy under 16 @-@ year children , when they travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this goes out of an internal paper of the Federal Minister for Migration and refugees ( BAM@@ F ) , reported the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ber@@ er Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; in the paper there is therefore , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; for families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since June 1st 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible so the paper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; following the Dublin @-@ treaty , for refugees the EU state is responsible for refugees who arrive at first . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant to a different EU country , this state can withdraw him back to the entry country . &quot;
&quot; for reason writing the post now : &quot; &quot; meanwhile the entrance fee for families with reduced children in Italy significantly increases . &quot;
Italy have taken over for the recording and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
&quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) , I consider these commitments for sufficient . &quot;
other EU states would return to refugees within the framework of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the inter@@ political spok@@ es@@ person of the Bundestag in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system un@@ law@@ ful conditions and a haz@@ ard to the child . &quot;
Ex@@ tended result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 lit@@ res blood of in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people presented the blood disp@@ enser , already for other people . &quot;
&quot; at least by the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; thanks to all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now shared 100 lit@@ res blood with his meanwhile 100 don@@ ated blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally honored the church in the session of the council , the multi @-@ fold willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome , how our body is laid for it and we z@@ ollen respect the sp@@ ect respect , which make their blood for stran@@ gers , nor is yet un@@ sel@@ fish , under@@ lined may@@ or Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood @-@ one helps several people , &quot; explain the circular feed of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ C ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preser@@ ves are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; thus , three people could benefit from a blo@@ cking @-@ profit . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported by the actions included in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 don@@ ors the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ C circular base . &quot;

Bank of England will keep interest rates of 0.25 %
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England is expected later to be known that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the atten@@ uation of inflation is shr@@ unk over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; orders &quot; will remain , when they entered the interest rates upon family , in the midst of a rein@@ vigor@@ ated pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for which interest rates on 0.25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has increased the support for an increase in this month . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly report reduced the bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 on 1.3 % and for 2018 on 1,@@ 6 % and war@@ ned that the pressure on the household income would continue , whereby inflation in autumn is expected to increase even at almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , it would be necessary to grow by the Bre@@ x@@ it inflation and she said that the credit costs may rise more than expected to the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw into a part of the Mam@@ mut package , which was published a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the Finance plan to provide from the coming February endor@@ se funds for banks , although said that it is expected to make 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pound ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC remains weak , since the pressure on the Real@@ ms of households will continue to charge the consumption . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates , they re@@ peti@@ tive that &quot; a certain roadmap of monetary policy would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets predic@@ ate the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank empha@@ sized that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts made by the Bank for this and next year are expected to be projected in May between 9 % and 1.9 % .
it has retained its growth forecasts up to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell upon these news compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell around 0.@@ 4 % on 1.11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes , after the recent dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth have risen up the rising expectations of an emergency relief and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.3 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter , the growth is expected to recover from 0.7 % , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent in@@ for@@ ation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by a rising inflation and low @-@ level sal@@ ary , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing first becomes even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; it added that the monetary policy in the coming years cannot prevent the income tax at the next few years , but they added that wages will be forecast for the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound rather , which will compens@@ ate a part of the lower consumption . &quot;
&quot; the decision is a year after lowering interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which brought the sin@@ ks of the pit . &quot;
&quot; the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years , until this will be able to achieve the prices and the economy . &quot;
&quot; prior to the final verdi@@ ct of the Bank to the interest rates , the call was increased after a dis@@ solution , since inflation was raised the pressure on hard bled households , with three political decision makers in July a rise to 0.5 % demanded . &quot;
inflation is fallen down last month of 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.@@ 6 % although the Bank said that this was expected and they will come back in the coming months .
&quot; the Bank said , the passage in relation to its objective of 2 % may be &quot; quite &quot; the weak pounds . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent return of S@@ wap bodies , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the credit@@ ors would like to seek shopping and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those who run the existing De@@ als and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) shall bru@@ ising HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10.000 people
patients will be received from September after the high court fight against funding of the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV @-@ Pre@@ ventive treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one before the intercourse bi@@ ased predic@@ ted proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the Inf@@ ection risk of approximately 86 percent , now from health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after having confirmed the Court of Justice in the last year a verdi@@ ct of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year , that the N@@ HS had to pay the authority for which pre@@ p should finance him despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the published paper was announced by N@@ HS England , Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) published this as the &quot; decisive moment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bright@@ on , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be one of the first ones who will allow the registration of people and further clinics will follow in October 2018 in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ valence proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations to be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p is significantly reduced the HIV transmission in Inf@@ ection endangered types .
pre@@ p to take before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as early as two hours prior to intercourse .
&quot; those who come for the treatment in question are pregnant or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners that have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics the appropriate participants are identified to match the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered with a household doctor , can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic . &quot;
the program will be awarded to £ 10 million and N@@ HS England a contract for delivery of drugs during this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p , which are collected and implemented in large scale , as it is implemented in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts towards the prevention of HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted to needs and end@@ anger people , the opportunity to change the English HIV epidem@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS financing in England in order to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority now must lie that the study is done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now as the pre@@ p @-@ test@@ es was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome after month of delays and hes@@ it@@ ated implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence show how transform@@ ative these drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is done as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people , the HIV infected are , and that they contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living on living : mezzanine and cl@@ ever@@ e designer @-@ tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a spacious home .
&quot; Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , tr@@ aded 2014 from a big house in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not packed their pockets and sold .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I sear@@ ched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
I was in love in her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square @-@ foot of the apartment was completely rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; originally a one @-@ room @-@ property with a wast@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine floor to optimize the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose they commissioned the Architecture and Design@@ studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
fan had to be creative to solve the award .
&quot; the steel mill is quite complicated , &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the spaces so that they were over@@ thrown with each other , without having had to leave us . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about to build a simple platform , but the steel so that it did for the function above or down the correct height . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement makes it possible to place a fan , two spaces in full height and with a lot of extra drama . &quot;
for the mezzanine a classic tabby spot@@ light from retro @-@ window by Retro@@ u@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
&quot; sc@@ ored gold furniture , sil@@ ken acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ se@@ ers put the style for the program . &quot;
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theat@@ res , space and light . &quot;
at both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to let him work longer .
the kitchen feels the mir@@ r@@ oring like a window into another room .
at the entrance mir@@ r@@ ored units place for all the seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can conclude the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a gar@@ ment door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; it is object @-@ important , so that when you push the door high , very easy gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cl@@ ever@@ ly use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win over 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and a improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the plot - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate can enter and perform a calculation based on soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the ground floor and use the same high quality materials which give the room to its luxury advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and that can help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical so@@ ckets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be turned out by a good design and increased square met@@ amorph@@ osis of slightly by default into something totally amazing .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them not . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar real estate
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ asty , in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as , worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &quot; &quot; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business is to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp struggle about the separation finds in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna possess the brothers 38 real estate valued at more than half a billion dollars , since the family 1973 a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the family of West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis is now looking at offices in the city centre , the development of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with its dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operators &quot; and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis described - about two thirds of the enterprise , and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court rule that it means that col@@ in property has been owned by 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be direct for Paul than issues .
&quot; those proposed by Col@@ in proposed resolutions have left him with what I held for the best objects , he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ it . &quot;
on the last Friday the first hearing took place at the Supreme Court of Justice .
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - Of which Col@@ in , such as Paul asser@@ ted him . &quot;
&quot; argu@@ ed , this is not true , but casts Paul before , some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent to manage . &quot;
&quot; in an early affair it was filed by Col@@ in , says he , he hope to settle the argument . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage is writing that the family is the most important priority , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter che@@ que , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides hosted by the law firm . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her husband husband Luigi were Italian immigrants to buy milk bars and dol@@ ph@@ at@@ edi@@ en@@ cia from the late 1950 @-@ s and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in the Col@@ in the first je@@ ans of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was in the High School , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said many times to me that he never wanted to land the brethren , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark when leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke as well as Mark , so Paul &quot; says of the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very with@@ held although he was a former AF@@ L executive committee and after a biography of the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyer .
&quot; just col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; &quot; because the case before the courts be . &quot;
&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to complain , and to pull our family names through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our Father had not been meant that Paul and I would like to end in our current contest , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Stab@@ ili@@ ef is planning to restrict the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the president .
others have tried it and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Pol@@ tico reports that the new Stab@@ ur@@ ef of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tru@@ mp - including reports of news media - in the hope of holding the boss on a lower course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ por@@ ter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ ur@@ ef of the White House , met his first working day with leading employees , he presented a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he would fix : poor information , who fall into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the employees , that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better choices when he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to um@@ er@@ ate Tru@@ mp by monitor his media . &quot;
President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television reaches decades of decades - and now where he is in the White House is his TV value still strong .
&quot; when nomin@@ ate Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of an in@@ fair coverage was it productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; &quot; said the former election of Sam Nun@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; the key to hold Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter &apos;s habit in control , according to six former election officials to ensure that his personal media sum includes a steady lob@@ ster . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter @-@ habit ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps this campaign could not know something that we do not know other - that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twe@@ ets have not included even more pointer without their interventions .
we will probably never hear something about the twe@@ et that will not send the Tru@@ mp .
&quot; when his staff began to hold it a few times , anger from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has to prevent it consistently , that Tru@@ mp Res@@ ver@@ sen calls . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a white house that sets forth out of competing parties , always trying to present their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultants , the president for immediate reasons . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ officials say that Tru@@ mp like a volcano can react on negative press cuts , especially such with sh@@ ov@@ ating Lec@@ ks , and that he can figure out to find out what they origin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; this happened in late February , when someone called the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ new@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who acc@@ used the Deputy Head of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a p@@ ile of le@@ aks to be in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson had banned from thy@@ ans from the Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he has vo@@ iced incorrect precau@@ tions and res@@ c@@ ant it in the past . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and began to ask people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; he added that the dam@@ ar Stab@@ ur@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tries to implement a system to manage the pap@@ er@@ m and to document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did this work out ?
Kelly try three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ si@@ ves self , and his consultants still strive for influence . &quot;
this un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
master@@ ing crimin@@ als get Post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the assistance of the population is praying and hopes . &quot;
the police in all Europe are ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to the dangerous crimin@@ als at the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the sear@@ ched heavy @-@ bre@@ aker are not known , evidence of the population will be lifted and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; Christmas calendar from the winter . &quot;
the experience had shown that many wings are hi@@ ding in holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
one has collected 21 post@@ cards for sear@@ ched crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , there is the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ less , more than 2.5 million times this was viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online can@@ y@@ ons could not be arrested so far , at least eleven of them according to the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s &apos; series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands meet again with some resol@@ ute travelers on the war , which have negotiated one by the municipality of zo@@ omed gr@@ aben to re@@ claim@@ ing a field before their houses . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s &quot; series . &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of Transpor@@ ter , after they have been rejected in May without hes@@ it@@ ated by one from the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tac@@ kl@@ ess group found a gap in the defence of defense and oppressed their cars through a section that un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have ash@@ amed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &apos; us@@ eless be to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous residents said , &quot; You are pulled out on the evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they took stones on the pas@@ sers . &quot;
the Council must be forced into action by putting them into action since he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were moved there in May and went back again .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by offering long under@@ instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy , continue to pay my parish , if the Council cannot stop this once again . &quot;
&quot; a residents who did not want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of these travelers to be lo@@ oted only by another round . &quot;
the numbers have raised this time and you even saw a horse in the park area .
&quot; a spok@@ es@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a pricel@@ ess camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence @-@ collection , it is very important that as many inhabitants report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court must prove , when we submit our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened again on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the dam@@ al@@ ous ambience operating company , to the 13th of April 2014 , which began approximately 30 000 nights per year and also revenue from the city tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatically ending numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building is offered as a collective accommodation , which is used for contro@@ vers@@ y discussions . &quot;
the city prevented accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the preparation of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was at that time in the council of not un@@ contro@@ versi@@ al .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ kan@@ ger Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location , and spoke at the time of serious prosp@@ ective buyers on the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with chair@@ men Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with a voluntary au@@ ction in Berlin and will make it a home of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städter House 4 homes .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have been around the entrance for a longer time period in front of the entrance , and when one enters the house , becomes clear , what extensive renovation works will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were found out , blankets to the part is built , old bath@@ tubs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , there are new window built . &quot;
&quot; everything seemed to be &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer express . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a conference room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sized Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms set up broad and explains Sch@@ erer .
&quot; both individual holiday makers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel at home in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourist Office Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led to so .
the performances of the city will be equal to those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments in demand , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; just below a million euros , it counts . &quot;
&quot; the outdoor facilities are also brought on the front , which is already visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard a large terrace comes from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special Jury sets the Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russian affair at the U.S. , President Donald Tru@@ mp is said to have a special Grand Jury as a report called Grand Jury as a report called Grand Jury as a report . &quot;
&quot; the panel has recorded the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; taking appointment on with the cause trusted persons . &quot;
the paper valuable the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investig@@ ators and intensified .
&quot; the station CN@@ N reported , there is already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s cool@@ ant son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; U.S. intelligence services acc@@ used the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time , targeted to the presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller studied whether there was abor@@ tions between Tru@@ mp@@ s el@@ ectoral team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigation , several men are supposed to stand in the election as a consultant of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; say , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s priv@@ ates and business environment under the magni@@ fying lens . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special sail@@ or Tru@@ mp wrote to the Centre for a few weeks and I seek the pres@@ tige , whether the President has hin@@ dered the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide to determine whether the indic@@ t@@ ment should be raised .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called charges .
mostly they are switched on when it is bigger and contro@@ vers@@ y cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched from the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s office to load persons under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N stations , the inv@@ itations were already shown to turn the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ R. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting may be asked to make a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ R. were also Tru@@ mp@@ s consultants and Chief @-@ law J@@ ared Kus@@ hn@@ er as well as his dam@@ iger el@@ ectoral director Paul Man@@ illas in conversation .
&quot; legal experts said on Thurs@@ days in the U.S. television , that the in@@ spec@@ tions show that Mu@@ eller cannot be intim@@ i@@ pped in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it was not necessarily hot that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the re@@ composition of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums of the beginning of a new phase in the studies and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; among the new revelations of the President on Thursday night , a speech in West Virginia to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total in@@ vention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the subject give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they don &apos;t have anything else about whom they can talk . &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion he wis@@ se nothing of the replacement of a Grand Jury .
&quot; but this also usually in secret , he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House fears all measures , which acceler@@ ated the work of a special agent in a fair &quot; fair &quot; way . &quot;
the former F@@ BI boss James Com@@ ey have told three times that not against the president will be determined .
&quot; one has no reason to accept that something changed , the name of it was in the Declaration on . &quot;
&quot; but Mu@@ eller was only used , after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fil@@ med . &quot;
&quot; because of this r@@ aus@@ ages were alleg@@ ations of Tru@@ mp according to , he has disabled the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp made him requested by an attitude of investig@@ ators against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; according to the representation of US media , the White House is gathered against the special and its employees . &quot;
the proceeds spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release .
&quot; unlike an independent special mention of Congress , such as in the Water@@ gate affair at the later back President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , has Mu@@ eller a position in which he theoretically could be fil@@ med by the president of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several transm@@ itters of both parties want to bend such a step but prev@@ entative .
&quot; two groups of rep@@ ublic@@ ans and democratic sen@@ ators created on Thursday &apos;s law@@ ns before , after which the special mention could no longer be released . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tic : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tica has solved a gigantic Eis@@ berg from the barely si@@ eben@@ dable size of Berlin from Schel@@ del@@ s .
&quot; this distributed the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar@@ stern , and marine research on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the about a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers big pist@@ on t@@ aps now moved to north and will probably be two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it has been registered with 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers , one of the biggest Eis@@ ances that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people is not coming from him .
&quot; to what extent , climate change has played a role in the quar@@ ry of the ic@@ eberg , is un@@ clear after research . &quot;
&quot; overall , however , there have been a series of unusual cl@@ av@@ als in the region for some 30 years in the region , the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) is located in a fac@@ ul@@ atory background for some 30 years . &quot;
&quot; according to the opinion of many researchers , it could be combined with the warming up @-@ up . &quot;
the col@@ on pist@@ on was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s .
Schel@@ del@@ s swimming on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it thus grows further into the sea and runs regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this Schel@@ m@@ ises was the balance of w@@ ax@@ ing and ab@@ rup@@ ting hundreds of years ago .
&quot; a complete demonstration was there , writes AW@@ I resear@@ cher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about it that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s are in danger , because the front can@@ te has never moved as far as at present . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the ice @-@ plate will stand at voltage and can drop , if at a key point a piece ab@@ bre@@ d . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Shel@@ f and ic@@ eberg increases the level as they go on the water and ur@@ ges ice so much water , as it comes after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the Shel@@ ters leads to the glacier right into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the lower size , the British research project writes about the observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ m@@ s is after AW@@ I @-@ information with nearly 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth largest Schel@@ s of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; at the passage from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and is aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice tag is now in a shared position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; confirmed also . &quot;
&quot; under scientists be contro@@ versi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s will now go back or long run and possibly merge together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers go down the quar@@ ry of this gigantic ic@@ eberg not on climate change , so in the past decades , however , very many ice r@@ ink of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula are dis@@ inf@@ ested . &quot;
this long run of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data of the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the Ic@@ ef@@ its of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula since the 1950@@ s has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
&quot; to decline , temperature has contributed . &quot;
the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has passed over 50 years by around three degrees and fold in the areas where the temperature are the fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants home @-@ if at the staff
&quot; because it &apos;s always harder to occupy free places , the CD@@ U calls on the working @-@ association to become more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the K@@ rei@@ stag 41 new places was carried out in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now even 17 appr@@ enti@@ ces have their first working day behind him .
the teachers in circles are obviously very popular .
some 620 applications were to be missed in this year .
nevertheless the circle has further staff to cope with the Asc@@ ended requirements and tasks .
&quot; at present , there are at the circle M@@ ett@@ mann to how 50 does not connected . &quot;
&quot; sear@@ ched for , among other things doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take part in the K@@ rei@@ a day together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and to take part of the emp@@ iri@@ angel in the administration .
the administration is to develop a concept for recru@@ iting and personnel development according to the desire of the parties . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term conditions of specialists , but forward @-@ looking for the assessment of the applicants , it is called . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an ex@@ empl@@ ation offensive , calling the CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this is listening to a good approach already after a good approach .
&quot; for the circle has to do with personal problems , which one previously knew so not . &quot;
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; the speech is by a regulation &quot; &quot; competition of the public employer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this makes a high number of employees , the disease or age caused by the service . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time to action so that no longer remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; however , Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , Fr@@ action of the CD@@ U , goes beyond his party nor beyond the common application . &quot;
&quot; he sor@@ cer@@ ated already in the put@@ ty for a f@@ au@@ st@@ thick surprise , when he asked the personnel @-@ deck@@ er publicly in question and the remaining parties . &quot;
people want to be reviewed all the possibilities that make a withdrawal from the municipal worker association .
&quot; if we do not come here at short notice to come to a satisfac@@ tory solution , the county @-@ administration with trade unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a car@@ nation @-@ if peoples &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; with this , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials to better pay the collective service to the public service actually . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only when one switches to a higher level that is oriented towards employment @-@ years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle has grown steadily over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established in which to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute . &quot;
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers have Land@@ mark Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ Director Martin Richter a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone to NGOs @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has a NGOs to use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , for@@ ew@@ ar@@ ned that they cannot continue to continue on new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs does not write any new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Inner Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ utes &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German auxiliary organisation &apos;s youth , because their crew had worked together with human hands in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organization that is only in operation since a year , it is starting to for@@ ti@@ fy themselves with detailed pre @-@ alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ ut@@ or Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us and remains the rescue of human life our top priority . so we are sorry that in the moment we can not operate in the search and lif@@ ebo@@ ats zone , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we may collect all acc@@ us@@ ations that are currently being collected , until we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had monitored the boat of &apos; youth ret@@ ched &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that his crew uses the infl@@ atable migrants on board , which can be delivered directly by human hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used to be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such coinci@@ dence , there was only 1,@@ 3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ ut@@ or , the content of the Italian media was published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is susp@@ ected to susp@@ end themselves on the authority of the Italian coast , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
under the Code of Conduct we need to have boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta mainly an Italian polic@@ eman on board that monitors their activities .
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and lif@@ ebo@@ ards have now been willing to hold themselves to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable because they would be no &quot; essential amendments or disability &quot; of their lif@@ ebo@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors without borders ( M@@ SF ) . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ utes said now , that the number of migrants said after the lif@@ egu@@ ard in Italy , in recent weeks have declined , what &apos;s efforts to strengthen the strengthening of the Liby@@ an coast and cooperation with local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Liby@@ an citizenship in this month on economic development initiatives , and with Ch@@ ad , N@@ iger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who can rely on Europe in the hope of Europe . &quot;

&quot; it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the pin@@ ewood forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there , there was again a longer stay , for the long tri@@ pod . &quot;
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s Wur@@ ttemberg .
&quot; again , look@@ out viewpoint at look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate attraction . &quot;
a lot of Al@@ titude in the last two days were told again .

&quot; after 173 km and almost 4500 meters , the group had learned the fold forest from his best side - spor@@ ty and cultur@@ ally - experience . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga supported by E @-@ Sport
sit the Sport @-@ Stars in future face a computer con@@ soles than to fight against wind and weather over the stadium r@@ asen ?
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; this also recognized the first federal government , which are increasingly active in this field . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg was followed by the V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the VF@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid @-@ July an e @-@ sport department , and two professionals for the computer game of FIFA 17 under the contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire a whole new young audi@@ ences for the VF@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; that on this turn it is even possible to asc@@ end . &quot;
&quot; on the next weekend , the football World Bank of FIFA organised in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; where the gam@@ er can compete in different clubs . &quot;
&quot; alongside Schal@@ ke and Wol@@ fs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now a agency for virtual so@@ ccer players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year old @-@ olds , that young people are still going into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : they tried to con@@ quer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian , to con@@ quer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract , one could be present online by far more often on these markets than once a year to send the federal government to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; at the E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation of FIFA on a competitive level . &quot;
&quot; long as in the normal sport even , Li@@ ke established , where the pros can compete against each other . &quot;
and in the Asi@@ ans there is e @-@ sport already part of the official program .
but is it a correct sport ?
for many of them the concept is safe to be used .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ail has a long time to deal with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ chschule in Cologne is e @-@ sport an sports , because he is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions , which one can also find in classical sports , for example increased heart frequency , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there is cog@@ nitive capabilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only be on the console , but also train their bodies and take care of the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ us@@ ations Player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but also problems : &quot; &quot; intelligence is becoming more and more a matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls may be hard through online gaming and in the scene the structures of classic sport .
scientists clearly highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the road internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural res@@ sources . &quot;
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and of the Federal association Inter@@ active teaching software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , we have been implemented 50 million euros in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsorship and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , the turnover of 130 million shall lie . &quot;
against the nearly 2,@@ 4 billion euros the Bundes@@ liga is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ashton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ sport competition provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
&quot; in an Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as a class@@ ement , says F@@ rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ a according to Dut@@ t is now committed to submit an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany depos@@ ited &quot; , &quot; explains VF@@ B @-@ Management R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in no@@ stal@@ gia to fall , and the old times has to be missed , is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; it is about keeping the tradition of the organisation , but to al@@ ign the company at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; also means Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; there you cannot say that only when football remains , as it always was . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics to push the Conrad Roy to su@@ ic@@ ide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged their friend through lyrics and calls to su@@ ic@@ ide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars , and five years were exposed to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned by Conrad Roy , who took the life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ dre@@ ary .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to stay free to appeal .
she was faced with a maximum of 20 years but their legal representative argu@@ ing that both she and Mr Roy racing at a mental illness .
&quot; in red p@@ ants and cre@@ me@@ able bl@@ ouse dres@@ sed , Carter da with t@@ ears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ oriented eyes , when they were sentenced . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ al in the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; it has no responsibility taken over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but car@@ ver was a lawyer , it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they totally de@@ pl@@ ores . &quot;
&quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity or even their minds have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ ut@@ or read an explanation of Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the poss@@ essed that there is no day in which I do not smo@@ ked the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain@@ s that we shall bear for eternity with us , for his sisters , it is called it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ d@@ yn Roy , said that she will never be prosec@@ uted from the knowledge &quot; &quot; I will never be taking part in the wedding of their brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this single person with whom I stayed together since my birth , is a pain , which I will keep in my life for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to set a legal preced@@ ence , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit to another , to commit su@@ ic@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; Carter was 17 years old , when Roy was dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ tage in a vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the case made national attention to itself , after car@@ ters texts revealed that they had to be encouraged to end his life . &quot;
&quot; Hän@@ g you on , spr@@ ing@@ ed off a building , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she was sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eye @-@ face before his su@@ ic@@ ide wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; All what you have to do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sear@@ ched by the death of Roy and dism@@ is@@ sed that they are benef@@ ited by any press by the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few , the Carter Release , the Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced to Italy because of murder of her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ l@@ ah@@ m of FC Bavaria
that Joshua ref@@ used to run at the Audi Cup as captain &apos;s intervention is no coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra @-@ motivation is not yet available .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the additional gar@@ ment was very small , very small . &quot;
&quot; but there is far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups of course not a Philipp l@@ ah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself a shared disk provided by the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , told the Con@@ fed Cup winner behind after its first use as Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the invitation could have been running better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of coach could also indicate that .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was in the youth of youth , de@@ fi@@ ants and just returned from the holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader . &quot;
&quot; sugars are being distributed at the most ador@@ est of those who have much to drink , which one wants to stop at La@@ une . &quot;
&quot; so those who was au@@ ser@@ k@@ ors was to compete with the heritage of l@@ ah@@ m , can only use a small extra @-@ motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ my confirmed , &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take over responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ l@@ ah@@ m above the field . &quot;
&quot; right behind , this is now its position , the white bin@@ ds at the arm opened its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ me in this start @-@ formation as the one who can take the rest of the best in the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to channel the un@@ attended tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had the ga@@ ze for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
&quot; Vi@@ dal makes his missing Fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ ds barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches so , on the devil , get out to the achievements of Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ ds even conditioned ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le there@@ with , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot not neg@@ atively . &quot;
all that end all very well .

&quot; the well @-@ connected Nap@@ oli @-@ storm did often very difficult , also tried to successfully tested addi@@ le in the game structure a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy was a fact that the result was not as it was , as we did . &quot;
but also he showed a decent performance during the debut .

&quot; as un@@ used this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the in@@ accessible , one looked at the score . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me came up a few k@@ cris@@ p statements in the back of his new co @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard of an interesting phrase : &quot; &quot; what is going on , I have already noticed . &quot;
in Bavaria you just need to win any game . &quot;
after all this he does not have to teach the new .

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz Minister : economy praise Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it often worked un@@ reconc@@ iled to the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) and the Ministry of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
this is evident after more than one year in which the new economic tank Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and impeccable the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing acc@@ esses the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in the Infra@@ structure policy : the bridge of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the pri@@ ori@@ ent &apos;s list of the country now .
&quot; again this year the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure , up to 2021 the construction is supposed to be . &quot;
a role in the plans of the country also does not matter by West@@ um Tri@@ er that stands in the urgent need of the Federal Office .
&quot; aim is to take the track in December 2020 in operation , says Minist@@ eri@@ ums@@ y Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees in it a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er wants , as from Wis@@ sing , when wine has stim@@ ulated an Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate Label to stop the paragraph in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Wis@@ sing is an open ear for people who want to create an own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Cr@@ afts Tri@@ er sees in the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; provided is a premium of 1000 euro for the best master@@ pieces and 2500 euros , if gradu@@ ates within ten years after the master training is self @-@ employed . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction was quick facts to create , at the same time bug the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Head leader of the I@@ HK Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; by 56 new engineers who want to adjust Wis@@ sing at the state of mobility , are so far occupied by 29 jobs . &quot;
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ac@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the Court of Audit@@ ors , the country of invest 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of national roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the skilled tem@@ angel in the region .
har@@ vesting is also the previous broad@@ band building in the country .
in 2016 regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the score 3.4 .
it is compl@@ aining about stock@@ ing@@ ed Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
&quot; at the moment , ex @-@ economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens Group left Lem@@ ke to April , to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she has already returned the field after four months . &quot;
Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction . &quot;
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ chairman said , the company was the opinion that &quot; it provides intelligent options as a constra@@ int , and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW can offer or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce his diesel emissions .
none of the companies describe the activities as recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , are considered as a car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automotive manufacturers , systems for the neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles to install out gra@@ vey@@ ing are also too , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
&quot; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged , the powerful auto@@ companies to conf@@ use and signs of the problem . &quot;
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ called v@@ age devices that regulate emissions if a car was tested , but at normal cycling conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several highlights of Volkswagen have been charged , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
in the last month the former leader of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investig@@ ators in Volkswagen , having been installed a system to have installed a system to control the emissions regulations in Europe and a request that has been focused on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the study could be Volkswagen hard to load : the luxury car manufacturer carries a proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was tim@@ eless one of the published Cart@@ oon label , the b@@ oll@@ ard of his figures are its trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ ines also stands and works on a film .
&quot; his message : lau@@ gh , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist he suggested , among other things as a sign for lucky pass , through which it was frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day , than in my job lost , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his cart@@ oons in &quot; Paris match &quot; and then also in &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
over and over again the artists of cities are inspired .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures in drawings with the sl@@ ing tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he is sitting according to your own data today , it works nearly ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches find his dro@@ ll figures still much spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gir@@ affe - Mor@@ dil@@ los , any animal in his drawings - that has a thousands of action . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak to the 3D movie from 2019 to the Kin@@ ol@@ ein@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that is why it is more likely to stand on the TV series , which is produced as its original design@@ ations . &quot;
lav@@ ender is threatened from Provence from climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is due to the lack of dro@@ ught minded conditions and because of diseases @-@ borne insects declined , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great he@@ ada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian institution CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in spring and fall much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small lan@@ ade , a micro@@ bacterial , the d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only used for vac@@ ation@@ ers but it is also in demand for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; rather than very long plant clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ ENT@@ W@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or curved . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with ether@@ ic oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered to be considered , are a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of the dun@@ geon from the ground , but also the radi@@ ance of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are opposed to drying . &quot;

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the Weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce will normally meet , in order to examine their plans for the coverage of the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through the organised crime , corrupt officials and c@@ eas@@ eless@@ ly drugs . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
&quot; it was communicated to them that it is important to change their routines . &quot;
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is safer to feel safe : you should take her children with the office , which were in 2009 the target of an attack with granite , or they were at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponent , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the re@@ por@@ ter , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ eptions and ab@@ dom@@ inal . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs gl@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists , who are susp@@ ected on the obe@@ ying list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that can prov@@ oke the chaos of Mexico . &quot;
&quot; there is no ruins of violence , and while throughout the country the corp@@ ses are tr@@ aded : at least 25 , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 took his office until after attacks and threats under federal law and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; under the latter , their editors and their aspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the Co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest error is to be in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of its numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack is felt deeply felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez , that is located on the façade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear the t @-@ shirts together with glasses , or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared issues , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ ry , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 has been established a Son@@ der federal Prosec@@ ut@@ or , in order to process the cases of journalists , according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with the most thousands of mor@@ als , which are linked every year with drug dealers and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will rarely be placed in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they are still struggling to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ com@@ for@@ ting , and although the terrain is still ob@@ li@@ que . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meetings for the discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very du@@ mm to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why we understand it all . &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks far before his rotating Toyota Cor@@ olla was raised by two men . he was forced by his car and 12 times was shot to him , probably due to the name of the newspaper - the &quot; &quot; Zw@@ öl@@ fter river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cap was driving away in his car and damaged it close .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he depos@@ ited a woman and two adult children .
ru@@ m@@ ors tend to be free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing to be silent .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans reduction in the last year and the delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since riv@@ alled political groups are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t make sure that in Sin@@ alo@@ a each day somebody or several people are shot on the street , or that the cemetery is full of ver@@ ings , two @-@ stor@@ ey mice for drug @-@ rounder , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs @-@ routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ under@@ standings has contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ fu@@ cking mapping transactions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have denied the sons , susp@@ ected Gang@@ lion bought each copy of the output , as soon as they delivered to Zeit@@ ungs@@ ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was not to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ isc@@ ation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , leaving the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend of Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had so long survi@@ ves that his friends and colleagues ann@@ ah@@ men that he would always be there .
he worked as a senior Repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este as he joined together with five colleagues on the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate a journ@@ alism without rep@@ ain@@ able problem , said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; at the time the newspaper served a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and promotion . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ter lover it , hard tre@@ ff@@ led investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories , no one else was to treat . &quot;
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce they received the pres@@ tige of &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history , where ever they led . &quot;
he voluntarily gave that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue working , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug dealers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you need to take on the task which falls you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; What have you done so many dead ... why did you not say what happened before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the sp@@ a@@ ß@@ bird , the like a port workers cur@@ se , the friend , the generous with h@@ ugs and advice , a teacher , who knew how to over@@ lives . &quot;
you trust in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ana , the bar opposite the office , and always sitting at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now , ask her : was his love to be a routine ? &quot;
&quot; his death also has forced them to ask her own assu@@ mp@@ tions in question , how they can do their work best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their own clean shops , their fur@@ ious start and cross @-@ cars &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even at the best times , a high level of self @-@ ship and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ inct .
&quot; if it is wrong , keep away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be get@@ away ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government offices . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the space where staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , there were suddenly no manuals allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware was sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activi@@ sts in Mexico . &quot;
outside studied two polic@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in j@@ okes , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked , whether these officers are among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen belong to the govern@@ or itself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months her , since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drugs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has spread to three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brood of the former known Box@@ er Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a Ex@@ pos@@ é to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors that focused on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ ut@@ or , a kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who has been kid@@ n@@ apped or how it came to write , so it was time to write , what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug retailers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ por@@ ter from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the governed Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) which was dominated by all political levels . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i @-@ Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ure were acc@@ used because of the top cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ters to write about previous inci@@ dents in this Local , including a place in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man took a military over@@ fall . &quot;
&quot; only a few months ago , the reader had seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had already known what happened is , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body composition . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers , dedicated to the Mor@@ de of journalists who have become something that they have never expected , what they had never expected : activi@@ sts in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ter Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ ut@@ or . &quot;
&quot; Salvador Ada@@ ms disappeared after three days , after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its . &quot;
throughout the country journalists have become more deeply by speaking in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on sal@@ aries and buildings .
&quot; on that day , director Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tried to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez acc@@ used Ram@@ i@@ rez the authorities , journalists ex@@ pi@@ on@@ ate and let them move , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has been asked for this reason that it is once again divided by the government , because it is concerned that their wo@@ e has in@@ ju@@ red their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico is organized by organised crime , a involved government and a consistent society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drugs , but also on command from politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks against journalists from police and officials in the last year .
&quot; in Mexico dies you , because they want you to go the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of blog@@ gers in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was suppos@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a Computer@@ mouse and ear@@ phones are in addition to their se@@ perate head .
some stores have chosen to close such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others will continue as there El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of its directors in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly on the title page with a leit@@ article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are from their hom@@ etown or even f@@ lown out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it was apparently ass@@ ass@@ inated the photographer of Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , the 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain left and continue , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
I@@ bar@@ ra who wanted to be the po@@ et there is to be sc@@ ares him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I was re@@ por@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce was already termin@@ ated in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , as at once all their teleph@@ ones began . &quot;
a series of shooting with absor@@ bers and security forces in the proximity of the bath@@ ed Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed m@@ ote .
the war escal@@ ated on how it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the bo@@ ord@@ stone you have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce about mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens close to - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the polic@@ emen , the guard to see if they were in willingness to see . &quot;
if they were afraid of all they did not show it .
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the ti@@ led founder of the newspaper , whose mid@@ finger was visible for quite s@@ alo@@ a , followed the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce its marks . &quot;
&quot; how can you also just think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez &quot; &quot; if the same day was mur@@ dered by the J@@ avier , the practic@@ ant me asked me to send it to the road to the road . &quot;
din@@ os@@ au@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to turn its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a terri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian Berg@@ worker were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even find that his created skin of r@@ red@@ dish Braun was - and they said , they had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; referred to him as &quot; the defe@@ ated din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ au@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs that lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably good un@@ common condition has resear@@ cher who is it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fos@@ sil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something which seemed from the surrounding rock in the plat@@ ter , and decided to see more accurately . &quot;
he discovered that by him Fos@@ sil was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; you spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work the finished result is ready to be un@@ vei@@ led , un@@ vei@@ led . &quot;
&quot; if you just got a little with the eyes fl@@ ashes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l museum where the creature has to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ au@@ rs copies - the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that these plant e@@ aters have been covered , although he is covered with an arm@@ or and a changing tank , probably threatened by flesh and sending din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ au@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is used as a counter @-@ coating , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to so@@ ften his enemies , say , what is threatened by greater din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs has made head@@ lines in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers now studied the wild animals and it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli named after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ cs Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7.@@ 000 hours with it to cover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the con@@ quer@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta are by far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by meat e@@ ater din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , that the evolution had fav@@ oured the confrontation of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals who use the cont@@ em@@ or@@ ting - think of deer , z@@ eb@@ ras or Hip @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as a boot@@ y , which was sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ y behaviour on a massive , strongly gro@@ unded din@@ os@@ au@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es have been of the chal@@ k @-@ time , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sk@@ als also shows that the skin of the din@@ os@@ aur is red .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal in references about his life , including his preserved intest@@ inal , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs died , when he died in a river and driven out into the sea , where he turned on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was so warm like south fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with contr@@ asting skin , but also kept in three dimensions and the original form of animal shelter , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost exactly as it looks like in the early war period .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k period was a time , as huge Ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ os@@ au@@ ction , which stood on two legs , the earth crossed . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , was destroyed by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ aurus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six ton har@@ es monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings in the magazine Current Biology will appear , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is fl@@ ank after death in the sea and in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the reserved din@@ os@@ au@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips . &quot;
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops , which dominated by its shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters was curved by the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater con@@ sign@@ ment of the din@@ os@@ aur @-@ kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the jan@@ it@@ est are still b@@ ump@@ ed tank @-@ plates along the din@@ os@@ aur
how Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geo@@ graphic is such a level of preservation so rarely like a gain in the lot@@ to .
&quot; the more I ans@@ ed , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank , which carry the sk@@ ull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right front is on his side , his five fingers are split up . &quot;
I can count the shed on his sole .
in the storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many publishers
fier@@ y accident on Thursday night on the A8 : almost 30 cars are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous clubs , kilometres long st@@ ems - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) the late Thursday morning at a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age about 20 people had been viol@@ ated .
&quot; according to the first details of the police were at 17.00 hours between the terminals Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a plum@@ age of almost 30 cars , among them probably also de@@ bu@@ gg@@ y . &quot;
&quot; over the exact number of last , no data will be charged . &quot;
&quot; it is about light to moderate injuries , said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
a large se@@ at@@ ot of ambulance aircraft was at the dro@@ p@@ outs .
the A8 has been fully locked in direction Munich .
driving in Munich is formed a total of about ten kilometres long .
&quot; as a AZ re@@ por@@ ter reports , it came also on the counter @-@ car to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire@@ men not@@ ated the marks of the vehicle &apos;s wr@@ ist who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. , then a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
in doing so it was a coll@@ ision between an auto@@ ot@@ ran@@ spor@@ tive and a car .
a rescue hel@@ icopter was on the way to the wrong place .
Deutsche Bahn : Group audit &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a genius thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and arous@@ ed a impro@@ per or put the chassis in the middle of the workflow .
cardboard control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently has the latest cart@@ on control .
one simply confirms the mobile phone that you have taken its place and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently a test run on two routes .
&quot; when the offer comes to , we wide it out . &quot;
&quot; it will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a train spok@@ es@@ man . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called the rail@@ road conversion without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; to use the use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have a online ticket booked - what happens already the most passengers .
&quot; you have to also bought it on the app &apos;s app , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one goes down in the train , calling its ticket under &quot; My ticket . &quot;
when the review is then a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the accessibility get on their mobile devices a message that chassis X is located in the train and is taken to the seats Seat Y .
&quot; comes the pull @-@ companion from the ticket control to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already ent@@ angl@@ ed online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so we can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who want to travel safely without Ticket@@ control by our accompanying staff , chec@@ kt in the DB Navigator just itself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to shape their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing manager of DB remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives , white , that besides delays , and missed the bicycle controls to the biggest b@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; for often , you do not have any documents in any case , but one of the fellow travelers will not need all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either you lack the credit card or the credit card or otherwise a document that you have to do .
&quot; the episode are endless discussions between the companion and chassis , which leads to poor atmosphere in the evenings or grand@@ parents and delays at the end of his own ticket and take the work at the end of time to take care of others . &quot;
only a small number of Test@@ ed customers can use the new service .
and that is only available on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other traction numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken to her core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after they arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Pra@@ yer on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat , which they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the road , called it there . &quot;
&quot; confused as no one else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly on its tim@@ eline ret@@ we@@ et .
&quot; Rap@@ ha from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year @-@ olds , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed , live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns alive body that was out@@ stretched on the road and stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , I thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone to return later in the evening to get to Twe@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , the cr@@ ying , and by a man who carried out , who carried a sign with the wording : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ished dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , said another Poli@@ z@@ ist his rif@@ le and cri@@ ed , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , re@@ minded Fer@@ rel@@ l to their statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and that we can call typical .
at this moment I felt sh@@ ook .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return trip and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock they took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on next morning .
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the cin@@ em@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ant , the love and loss of power , the strength and resistance of resistance , who are living in the community and the streets filled to challenge answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , after Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the two have a conversation that she had countless times before this morning , about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you re@@ minded you how I taught you when black people have to fight for the fight , what they believe ? &quot; re@@ minded them of what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year boys and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them away , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot;
what happened today is a climax of what happened in the past .
you must know it and be re@@ ared and moved it into it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have good luck to give her an experience in which they personally have no e@@ kl@@ ed racism , it is not different from the next black women . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them off . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived at Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp@@ ground , when the activi@@ sts has been waiting for the possible non @-@ indic@@ t@@ ment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with a local business owners who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism started for Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed after the 9th August completely , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black churches . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot;
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the Co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her compan@@ ionship Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to only document what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l in the sense : &quot; &quot; you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ tic@@ ism has been nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their res@@ ili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who have been born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and grew up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for its activ@@ ism around deaths . &quot;
&quot; his dedication brought the project near@@ er , along with six other n@@ atives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years to Brow@@ se shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because so will I be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it is in the movement &quot; not about a m@@ essi@@ ah guide , but about a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells life , as she likes and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that it has to give a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells has history the role of black pregnant women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media in 2012 identify the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media . &quot;
&quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , pregnant women must carry the main last of all . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an un@@ anim@@ ously to notice that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women .
&quot; it exists however , however , that this is not a affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action is , &quot; at the Fer@@ rel@@ l chosen as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the fore@@ front , because in a life on these crosses as a black , pregnant woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras disappeared from Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on has long gone , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on nutrition for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area , which they called their homes : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she feels at a singing and she feels committed to this memorial , since they went into the street three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; from &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; Siz@@ ing &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery &quot;
the bit gallery moves the people even though it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has been ob@@ sol@@ ete since the first presentation 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
&quot; cold , the theme is hardly possible . &quot;
&quot; also on our Facebook @-@ Page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; this would be genuine &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , &quot; from the other side : &quot; needs no human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ setting ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; Siz@@ ing ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates insi@@ sts that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which the other business will benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery will be planned exactly on the property , in which the market hall stands , in the 13 direct market mark@@ eted its products . &quot;
with the beginning of construction work there will be a conclusion .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a mark@@ eth@@ in to the new building - and for the need for a Bed@@ a place with the possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been playing almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the land are always happy to be very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would wish that also during and above all after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there are also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct market mark@@ eted in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this is likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what to shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; ob Cl@@ othing , shoes , Dro@@ ger@@ ie@@ - or supermarkets : I find this super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; of which , there is already enough in our city . &quot;
one can see how many shop@@ stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but there is still not even a decent weekend market , it is the more important that we at least remains at least the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods delivered there is fresh , mostly delivered directly from the producer and is ob@@ end@@ lessly inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop@@ stores are reserved in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the dor@@ m Rent are often not portable for a ret@@ ailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special shops are almost no longer and what still exists , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall fits for me not .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the farmers market hall during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in duration when the bit gallery is actually coming out .
&quot; or creates the g@@ p@@ est bit gallery before , all stores from Bit@@ burg to exp@@ el ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmers market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farm hall give it thanks to the wa@@ hn@@ y many - as I find - sensu@@ al construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no room anymore .
&quot; when the farmers market hall is made , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates por@@ traits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ verse , on the cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 por@@ traits were made by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ away and hair @-@ sections that have been sent by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sch@@ ick@@ ed the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence company analy@@ sing a 35 @-@ year warran@@ ties , after it has been regarded as geh@@ eim diplomatic reports on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition which was opened on 2nd August , means A Bec@@ oming res@@ embl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed their expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and M@@ anning , a Trans@@ wife and disc@@ rep@@ ent disco@@ urses , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extrac@@ ted by M@@ anning and made of the 30 por@@ traits as someone can be interpreted by these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the in@@ tough@@ er determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to the identity .
&quot; M@@ anning , which was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has spoken openly since their pu@@ ber@@ ty on the identification as a woman , 2013 was condemned because of 20 charges , including six cl@@ ashes against the sp@@ ying network , computer was and theft . &quot;
&quot; in prison her image was supp@@ res@@ sed , so much that there was only one photo - a bask@@ ets , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in the M@@ anning becomes apparent un@@ comfortable on a driving seat and a plat@@ inum blonde is carrying - with which it was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this produced the artist por@@ traits of foreigners from for@@ ensi@@ c art@@ e@@ facts such as cigar@@ ette bl@@ unt and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a Zeit@@ ag@@ azine .
&quot; she led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artists in and their ind@@ es@@ hal@@ ted M@@ use were inter@@ fer@@ ed to un@@ equal bricks that inter@@ f@@ ates several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; she even illustrated one by Sho@@ ili Can@@ ung@@ o illustr@@ ates Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed images , &quot; which would be a future predic@@ ted in which the President Chel@@ ation judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days , after the book was published to challenge the release of release after seven brut@@ al years in a military an@@ x@@ ious in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome type of happ@@ enings . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deeper and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp causes a war against inform@@ ants from the government camps and against trans@@ gender @-@ troops to find new , Twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid divisions , which he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things from a certain reason happen . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery written M@@ anning called M@@ anning with their over@@ sized signature including ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their surname is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of C@@ s and GS and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , descri@@ bing the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ cl@@ e@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , like amazing similar , at least in biological ways , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully bring about it is that our gen@@ ome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ an Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition which is stored in an own room is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; it shows m@@ anning , as it appears with a free pre@@ ach phone in the hand from the disciplines of the United States such as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they speak your speech , then they have won it , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , which greet people from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I always come up go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps , when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition - as it was pres@@ cient in the com@@ ic book , but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room from the mas@@ ks , of their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation , which coll@@ ap@@ ed themselves like hormone products . &quot;
&quot; this was also oriented , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ istic groups were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the por@@ traits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted that it feels like a mass movement that feels with Chelsea , as the movement , which is also hidden behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ west and a representative of the University of Oxford because of killing .
&quot; a nationwide human @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and at the University of Oxford , who were looking for a guy in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , for Wyn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) on the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , like the acts of the court of C@@ ook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several styles died . &quot;
&quot; one by the police authority of Chicago published , that the corp@@ ses on 27 July was discovered . &quot;
&quot; Beam@@ te received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim of several injuries at his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was still declared dead on the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the stit@@ ches as a murder , while the police actively examine the two compar@@ isons , said Beam@@ forming . &quot;
La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ west University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for university relationships , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them may now be in be@@ ur@@ u and excluded from entering the Campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ urses University co@@ operates with this investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spok@@ es@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation , that we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ators in every concei@@ vable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want it to be .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said , he urge the susp@@ ect to ask the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has a concept of their place , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building managed by the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ Building which had just received a mysterious tip that occurred in apartment 1008 something . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cru@@ el .
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , it was un@@ clear whether the incident occurred on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren in the building were .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the loop and expl@@ ores a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the W@@ ada timetable in the near future &quot; &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ i Mut@@ ko says , it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ mental doping agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ mental agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; at a specific stage of fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap R@@ USA@@ DA received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ doping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada @-@ Road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada for adher@@ ence to the code that describes the criteria for re@@ composition by R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he contains anything that could cause for Russia cause . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria named above , however , is that the Russian anti @-@ mental authorities det@@ ects the measured results of by the W@@ ada approved by Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accepting D@@ op@@ ings in Russian Sports . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; we lead the examination by because our anti @-@ mental system has a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; nuts with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ mental Commission . &quot;
&quot; in the conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had trouble in the past in Russian anti @-@ intelligence organizations , but added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report is contro@@ versi@@ al of contro@@ versi@@ al positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was ruled in November 2015 in the course of the doping sc@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada by the execution of dop@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ doping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the principal of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli said that R@@ USA@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be re @-@ utilized . &quot;

the start @-@ ups that will help your business will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy En@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure your luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anon@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not understand the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Reed . &quot;
it was called people from the outside by means of help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licens@@ ing of software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of the employee commitment , it allows companies to conduct regulatory groups and dem@@ ographic groups , employees anon@@ ym@@ ity and complaint articles , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers allow to address the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they have now tools such as Str@@ ava and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools of companies will be used to measure staff commitment . &quot;
&quot; he said that they have better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company which shows most complaints and what executives may have low addi@@ tives , so that you can im@@ itate why . &quot;
&quot; to do this , see that at the top of the workplace culture , you need to do not the next U@@ ber , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then , a former employee has published a blog post , which describes a environment of concerns , among those who have spoken , pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups as G@@ lin@@ t this requirement is an overview of lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibilities .

&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increase in interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;

&quot; how G@@ lin@@ t , lets Conver@@ cent companies tailor @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s &quot; Sur@@ veys , confidential answers in real time and view the warmth cards of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line with the employee who can report a bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business is included , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the Reg@@ ulators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his staff is treated poor@@ ly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can be precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cot@@ t , worker @-@ flu@@ x and fl@@ ages , &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , conver@@ sions have been aware of more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have a simple way to have their company headquarters . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company &apos;s central , a formal complaint and hope that he was serious . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intim@@ i@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Conver@@ ted conver@@ ts can be solved problems that have previously identified by leaders , hidden in offices in cities or countries , - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or irregular internship will be identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ level view into the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; Vit@@ rano , which manages the risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders on employment and legal disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began , ethics , values and employees work in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen coll@@ ap@@ sed because of eth@@ ic cl@@ ashes by the En@@ ron @-@ Sk@@ an@@ dal , said T@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and the company with recur@@ rent fees for use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors , which supports both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sap@@ phire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; he secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly expected , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is an increasing complex of research that shows the present employees of their work@@ places more than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects just in@@ serts .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be in a company who do their voices , and that work they do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors can reach P@@ ob@@ ites when their portfolio companies run well . company run good if employees are working and committed .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third promise , commitment and commitment of the employee , it is no wonder that you find support . &quot;
the data on the employee commitment is important for the experts of the workplace culture .
but the data are us@@ eless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it can have an expect@@ ation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments can grow and viol@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , the company has seen to very much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow all the staff , have you really heard ? &quot;
do you take care of this ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t worry about it , why should I be ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Reed , who is now kid@@ n@@ apped monthly staff surveys , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day when a problem above G@@ lin@@ t reports , so salvation . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , she was able to create new teams within the company with the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , able to create several teams within the company and to add a communications training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday the company keeps getting new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better bonds of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose business . &quot;
die N@@ CA@@ A remo@@ ves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the break
it &apos;s going to be on 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus .
some have moved their jer@@ ox parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training course .
for a good part of the team these un@@ crowded minutes represent a mid@@ day break .
&quot; players who are written to the summer curve are written after the thir@@ st exercise to their final test , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m. to the Aqu@@ arian Football Center next morning . &quot;
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real p@@ tm@@ ess , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday became . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the load of players and she has actually extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the player already full @-@ packed sched@@ ules of the player . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , where the brood is postpon@@ ed at the beginning of Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school during the first time , during the first time , during the morning , six times of times in West wood is carried out practical exercises . &quot;
they should ab@@ ide in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; MOR@@ A said that he suppor@@ ter the control change of the N@@ CA@@ A suppor@@ ter , even if they add the busy routes of the player to add another point . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it down , they plac@@ enta further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , in view of the clear back@@ ups of its fields from an adjacent parking area and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that is already covered with pe@@ ep@@ herds , no easy task will be . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spatial that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched that people rent a room there and then set a practice there . &quot;
if you have the vide@@ o@@ and of a exercise it is a pretty good deal .
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking place 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I do not have too much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential items with fal@@ seh@@ ood of third parties and show their results under the original fee , then the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible fal@@ seh@@ oods and to send it to fac@@ ades , which may display results of the fact check of the original articles . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the key points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of which believe they also influenced the U.S. presidential elections 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe with the French voters in the run of the presidential elections in May , and Germany will support a plan to be pun@@ ished after social media networks , if it does not succeed to eliminate h@@ asser@@ t posters , as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany have started a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to knowledge , which stories are challenged by fac@@ tual parties , people want to be more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook @-@ News in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; in connection &quot; &quot; and in other changes to his news feed , to decrease wrong messages . &quot;
creation of a Com@@ ic RO@@ MAN@@ S : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze @-@ music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ er years a Schl@@ u@@ pf@@ lo@@ ch .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat at the P@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jam@@ ie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful , to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says w@@ ned . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; um@@ ented the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documented the families that illustrated in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote on 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he was un@@ expected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the th@@ umb@@ nail on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ term in the 1700 @-@ er years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b !
&quot; and letters always smell to smoke , because at that time you established a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives more than 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself would be . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who have done so with old Pap@@ ers , that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have seen my welcome &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vietnamese &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosity of the castle , such as the Mongo@@ lian hy@@ m@@ pots on the walls and the bottles , the centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated by the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ lords , gar@@ den@@ ters and sometimes also with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night d@@ k he wh@@ is@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was first received in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; as Rhodes a decade later met , the employees began to take care of the archive that he called &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the loft . &quot;
&quot; diary books , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , cards , which would pose : &quot; you could mean that land disc@@ usses ? &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ke to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go down ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to view that &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer up of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il , the 13@@ 80 in the castle appeared , in this book entitled &apos; Kn@@ ight@@ ly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farmer started in this area and I thought , an insurrection was a good beginning . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the history of the Jes@@ u@@ it pat@@ ers who hidden the family of Dar@@ rel@@ l seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos;s , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is depic@@ ted from the 18th century , who filled his own funeral ( a discovery that was made only years later , than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen are quite funny Ga@@ ther@@ er to be over and over again and spend money for things which they could not afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l Men sol@@ ates their debt crises , trying to married rich old women - I imagine it as a he@@ aps of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise encour@@ agement . &quot;
after the end of his efforts in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writer experiences
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel on El@@ se@@ sh@@ re@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has since been returned by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the wast@@ ed life again . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the vei@@ ling of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef on Friday started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau with Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team to keep the logo and the slogan . &quot;
at the end of August it should be the highlight of the campaign to be a festival on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the bill@@ board at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their own yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in the action it is about more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is continuing . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a common promise , one that the city gives an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able all@@ ey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ five amount is the town of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign will cost .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the Army
&quot; every year in early August , in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) on P@@ ensi@@ on@@ ations and tran@@ sports in offset . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but nothing is a routine upon the Turkish settlement , one year after the cou@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the headquarters of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in consultation with the presidency of the Government , the five Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ ers and the Minister of Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
these were civilians in the Y@@ AS in the transi@@ tions .
the government moves in the military the bree@@ ders .
&quot; the General Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ure of the army , air @-@ stre@@ ak forces and the Nav@@ y were buried . &quot;
&quot; since the recently opened cou@@ p , state Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als has been folded . &quot;
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually because of the links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire pul@@ ling of the cou@@ p . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people who have been involved directly to the cou@@ p@@ ile , has been negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the cou@@ p Erd@@ og@@ an had called Erd@@ og@@ an to the overthrow , as &quot; &quot; worship &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an has really a grip on the army ?
&quot; in the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ remedi@@ ation in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff there are concerns of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which is manifest@@ ed among other things in the abolition of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
the wholes@@ ale throat of the army and security forces in any case goes on .
in the middle of July Erd@@ og@@ an sent further 73@@ 95 citizenship in decre@@ e , including 23@@ 03 Poli@@ zi@@ sts and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
in doing so it seemed that Erd@@ og@@ an was t@@ amed to the military .
the gener@@ als g@@ old formerly known as the actual men of the country .
three times put@@ ted them by calling on their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the wel@@ der stat@@ ure .
&quot; after his election in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an began the power of the military &apos;s step by step , not least by calling on the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say that Erd@@ og@@ an is deliber@@ ately pro@@ gres@@ sing a Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; war@@ ned a particularly so @-@ called officers , who sought after the cou@@ p @-@ test from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; meets this , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the alliance , there is no doubt about the willingness of the Turkish army in the alliance . &quot;
&quot; the leadership @-@ structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees to lower the leg@@ ality immigrants on 5@@ 0,000 per year , str@@ ingent regulations for the slow@@ ing of visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty reducing wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by way the US will be able to change the way from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and to show knowledge which will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted from the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rest@@ or@@ ate track for racing
over the past few months over the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les over the past few months - now it should go quite fast .
&quot; even before the end of the year is to be built on the mar@@ o@@ des route , which drives the tourist track . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , should after data from the Ministry of Finance still in this year construction work on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and to order the route from Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ sti@@ g , the country is especially important for tourism , especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; explained road secret@@ ary Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of maintenance of the track is reduced to approximately 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country rose 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is also to be ordered in the future from the country , will be final and declared S@@ ühl . &quot;
the Ministry and South East as the operator has already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this is the timetable that used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ ühl . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the train company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so that the rac@@ sti@@ g shuttle to be ordered on December 2017 .
the racing car shuttle is mainly in tourists popular rail connection between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ sti@@ g .
&quot; during the past few months , during the course of a pilot business was tested , whether the circuit is used by sufficient many people to order them in the future . &quot;
the track is also strong in parts strong .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
&quot; just as you thought that there cannot be a crazy player , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) has published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ed Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the ey@@ eb@@ ink of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fingers . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny about them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern sex lips have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robot@@ ic with a si@@ licon skin , who feels warm to feel warm - with deliber@@ ately human reaction , which can be achieved through artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can also adjust his robots according to his beliefs &quot; and select everything , from the ey@@ ec@@ urity of the robot to the type or color of his fingers . &quot;
&quot; but it is still wor@@ rying , as many robots have the &quot; personalities , &quot; which would be a st@@ eppe @-@ woman progressive . &quot;
modern sex doll@@ s have turned into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robots makes it possible for example to adjust its users , their robots on the properties which they can be appealing , for example , for example . &quot;
&quot; and then there is still the True Comp@@ an@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots with pre @-@ programmed figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of drawers and &quot; &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , war@@ ms the site of True Comp@@ an@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she does not like what you do not like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also gave her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; she can be tired , be fixed to conversation or she can be &quot; in the mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ced female attributes , when you move a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : contradi@@ c@@ tory ) far@@ rah , un@@ disturbed one of the most . &quot;
on his website True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a Vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( si@@ c ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then do not have ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it is called on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex@@ ist . &quot;
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement indicate a little dar@@ ker and deeper understanding in our culture to a retreat from the Perfect of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as optional addition .
&quot; most men will of course keep no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notice its increasing popularity , they still remain pro@@ visional on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what emerg@@ es from the boundary zones , can be in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very educational . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not wei@@ rd or ob@@ sc@@ ary , until they have the free market with this permission . &quot;
&quot; but there is a certain over@@ cuts that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which it has under@@ gone a president in the White House that has under@@ gone women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most horri@@ ble aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the sm@@ elled body and the expres@@ sive eyes , but how realistic this vision acts . &quot;
the Republic of Gilead is a di@@ p but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity with actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
their buil@@ ders want to feel human being human to im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but to put on the point when it comes to their &quot; figures , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot;
you cannot separate or go away from their companion .
&quot; they have no placement or a background story , nothing , which could distur@@ b on independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of dead sub@@ jug@@ ation . &quot;
in other words : they are f@@ ake slaves .
or to express it in the re @-@ wise of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the In@@ compreh@@ ension of the healthy human mind .
&quot; it has become a bin@@ ess of the Tru@@ mp @-@ era , that the political divisions , which have polari@@ zed the US voters , even families in small @-@ format . &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest there was newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the hor@@ ror of Tru@@ mp @-@ related relatives .
we strict all suppos@@ edly to make our Filter@@ ing bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s to accommodate families .
&quot; I consider this because my c@@ ous@@ ine , a lin@@ ks@@ ong po@@ etic in Chicago lives and has been working for a long time with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , I visited this week in New York . &quot;
it re@@ minded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which they fought for politics , suddenly and very strange to the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this is also significant risks associated with it . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the accompl@@ ishing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ ass@@ ed possibility that we will no longer be able to ab@@ ide by one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still sh@@ red@@ ly long @-@ time scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; that appear once in comparison to its standards suddenly as in@@ compreh@@ ension of neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s com@@ ic version of the nar@@ row@@ ed - the dog on the car , which looked at 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - which are both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact a very mild ray . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp is going , the next candidate of rep@@ ublic@@ ans must only be spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ous@@ ins in the city was , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are k@@ nur@@ rig and the animals are twi@@ sted to look full of their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ ster and the cli@@ cked music con@@ veys this in an interesting way . &quot;
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a town dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old to become familiar with sky@@ lines to offer a lot of excitement and the reality of the city will not do the dream .
&quot; five years later , and I am still not quite over the day , when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss cottage - the themes @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Carousel is still a strange magical experience , since here two years old , a 11 year @-@ old and two women can go on it , and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; when I could rate the carousel , I could have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily no one has asked afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was comp@@ elled to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I was able to go through my credit card . &quot;
in the coff@@ e@@ aus at the corner of my road it is the same but the option to finish the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping - this to buy something about the counter .
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercise pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the poor wife in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zed , while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with bre@@ aches out of the prison in the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for the second time in prison for a hospital .
&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital due to the treatment of snor@@ ting to his hand , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned to the first total of prosec@@ ut@@ ors because of murder of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he gir@@ der Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of St. John by opening them several times by a door of the toil@@ et@@ ries in his house in Pre@@ toria on her wom@@ b .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ ly inv@@ aders , who hidden himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time to appeal against the six @-@ year imprisonment of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , from which they say she is too sight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Tribunal said , that they shall rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence increased to 15 years , if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold a strange egg is found
&quot; as the last of the flower schools , the four @-@ t@@ ese schools were released from F@@ rom@@ atic and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen to the holidays and to the leading schools . &quot;
three of the kid@@ n@@ atives will continue to go to the gymn@@ asium , four on the real school . &quot;
&quot; at the evenings , Angel@@ ika Sit@@ ka welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house of Bi@@ es@@ en@@ hofen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes chose the 29 students under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine , a young Adler , who is released in the ch@@ ick@@ erhof , but still being released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end the m@@ ist Sch@@ ar led a Musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and led it from his ch@@ ick@@ ens . &quot;
instead of a chicken ch@@ ick came a little eag@@ le .
&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , sm@@ ashed , the eag@@ le spread on a high mountain his wings and escap@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the classes showed three and four in the way of Yv@@ onne Frank a chicken . &quot;
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln to the cy@@ linders in order to bet the bet .
&quot; the eag@@ le stand for the integration , she said Angel@@ ika Sit@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; the k@@ ete@@ er may be different from the other k@@ ittens ( chic@@ ks ) , but belon@@ ged to this . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
you wish every quarter @-@ cheese that he feels at his new school .
&quot; it followed by gratitude to the colleagues , the former gu@@ ide@@ leader Michael Müller , who will always come again in schools , and the parent representatives . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ick is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; they leave their students after two years of lessons , because there had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , she can rely on the quad@@ ril@@ ater@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; to completion , all students will end a song from sum@@ mer@@ time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the children broke great joy . &quot;
for the new school year already eight Initi@@ ators are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians made due to illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained due to illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television , with . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police a group of illeg@@ ally people , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;

software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; in the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
you should improve the car@@ bure@@ tor of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE car Club Europe gives duty to :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ ann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has arranged the force of force ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a fast implementation in the coming months , but still no precise appointment . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
&quot; if any in@@ spec@@ tions be due , it will be done in its frame . &quot;
how long is the conversion to move in total ?
difficult to say &quot; means S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the relationship between the commitment of the manufacturers as well as the political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , volunte@@ ering act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
&quot; temporary , could it be to get an appointment . &quot;
&quot; what are motor@@ ists who do not drive a car of BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
&quot; probably , foreign manufacturers would consider , so s@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
threat@@ ens now a massive price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fear@@ ed this .
&quot; but even in the regions , where driving is dro@@ ught . &quot;
in rural areas there are so far no values for older diesel .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait with a sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center @-@ Award
the Kennedy Awards g@@ ala is one of the gl@@ am@@ orous events in the Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is considered first Rap@@ per one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the Kul@@ tu@@ cle@@ ation was announced on Thursday , in this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , and the ch@@ ore@@ ography in Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) to the schol@@ ars . &quot;
the awards will be handed over to the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. Donald Tru@@ mp will arrange a welcome and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; most progressive TV @-@ series &quot; &quot; winner E@@ ear announced that it was already announced to ren@@ oun@@ ce the participation in the Gala . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even the means to ent@@ ail them - and that will be charged . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the interview with Tru@@ mp to make their view clear . &quot;
this after the former president John F. Kennedy named Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest backdrop in the U.S. capital .

we make the city lively
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadtbau@@ atelier in the coming year in R@@ ente . &quot;
the place is already written - appropriate candidates are r@@ ar .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadtbau@@ atelier .
and the work still makes him great fun as he con@@ veys in pres@@ tige .
&quot; he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , that so far no application has been given the requirement profile . &quot;
the city looks for the next time an architect or building engineers .
so - in compliance with the regular cancellation deadlines - not enough time for a refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach are arranged for the administrative community as a sub @-@ law authority , the applic@@ ant has to be corresponding . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; would they no longer be able to fill out this anymore , the citizens would have to travel through to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but citizen &apos;s proximity be the city and himself important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good working environment , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated while the che@@ acker can look back with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city lively , he is secure about the building , and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park . &quot;
the ven@@ ties bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed even the stadium rehabilitation is still subject .
&quot; the latter alone is to strike with around 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we make it right &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
designed for a Stadtbau@@ atelier large play@@ room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ hof and gar@@ den@@ ner@@ ei can be quite flexible and re@@ acted .
&quot; you can move a lot &quot; , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the fo@@ ams are often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what rein@@ car@@ es , if new buildings are approved , stres@@ ses the separ@@ ator Stadtbau@@ atelier . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadtbau@@ atelier is a high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is client , &quot; at the end everything runs on my table . &quot;
&quot; in case of care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been a member of Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ construction ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , desires : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identifi@@ es himself and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; for continuity is not only important for a good company environment , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to be@@ aten Roland W@@ acker , should be completed after information of the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , a completed academic studies as a diploma in architecture and a Bachelor &apos;s degree of expertise in the areas of building law and planning . &quot;
&quot; the Stadtbau@@ atelier , building and deep @-@ building , construction planning , gr@@ en@@ wer@@ age affairs , management of urban cre@@ ws , urban operation with Bau@@ hof and city centre , including monument protection , including monument protection . &quot;
bike on line wir@@ es : south @-@ trail inhi@@ bited
&quot; according to the police , the blue bike passed by the railway station tr@@ aded in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so strongly damaged that the fet@@ al freight @-@ train had to be raised .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and looking for the night hours after them .
near the Tat@@ a were witness@@ ed a pink sco@@ oter and a bike riders have been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ ds , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spok@@ es@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the APA . &quot;
or the perpet@@ rators had given itself into great danger and is also endangered in public transport .
&quot; in addition to the damage at the L@@ ok and the system , as well as the delay in transportation and the costs for rail transport , you could also come to the offen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; overall , be to go from a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , &quot; the speaker . &quot;
the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon and the railway traffic on the south trail could be guided without disabilities .
&quot; nearly ten people of people were dis@@ astro@@ us , two of them frau@@ ds the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; goods are not out , but they had a delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spok@@ es@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged for approximately 200 metres high .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , milk products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bow@@ el ) . &quot;
rot@@ es meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could lin@@ ter the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ tresses . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1,@@ 3 million and in the United Kingdom of 300@@ .000 concerns , is caused by Mag@@ nific@@ ent and blu@@ ff@@ ing , recur@@ ring or blo@@ ody accidents , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; during those affected , meat and dairy products are usually come to all@@ evi@@ ate their symptoms , found researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ toner University out that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to proteins to promote immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the executive researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , declared that immun@@ o@@ cells in the intest@@ inal pat@@ rol to ensure that damag@@ ing micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the food not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to infl@@ amm@@ able infl@@ amm@@ ation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues to compens@@ ate . &quot;
if the balance is too far away in the direction of infl@@ amm@@ ation can result in an infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bow@@ el .
&quot; in experiments , it has been established that a kind of tolerance encourages immune cells at mice occurs that a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ium - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immun@@ o@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han nutrition toler@@ ated , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory Dar@@ mm@@ ili@@ eus when the same system is acqu@@ aint with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral tor@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an sought a kind of immune cells that had tolerance the tolerance , but a different group of the same tribe , which was separated , but had not been accommo@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; she susp@@ ected that the difference to do with the Dar@@ mm@@ ik@@ ro@@ om of the mice , - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that usually live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ ine . &quot;
the D@@ är@@ me of the mice were found DNA sequence and there were six species of bacterial cells that were present in the mice with the immune cells but without it lack@@ ed during the mice .
&quot; mice were raised in a ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they did not develop a bow@@ el and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria re@@ acted to the immune system , the researchers L. L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid , and then super@@ led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component has been puri@@ fied out of the liquid , it proved to be known as a by @-@ product of the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ acid acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ se@@ pul@@ ses were hal@@ ted , s@@ ank the number of cells around half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes Bar@@ rag@@ an declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. in our stomach @-@ intest@@ inal tractors . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells in humans develop as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ tresses . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells are infl@@ amm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of these populations . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; genius &quot; has committed
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; , &quot; the Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes in Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der was his debut on S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and really impres@@ sively in the holding part , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after popularity . &quot;
&quot; however , MAT@@ IC was removed from the Pre@@ par@@ ation Asia tour of the blues , and only 45 minutes said that he had to improve the Premier League Season before the start of the Premier League Season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
&quot; we will help him , earlier than later . &quot;
&quot; besides M@@ atic started , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent un@@ vei@@ led in this week , that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho yet had three further new li@@ abilities , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfill three of his four priority li@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the club , &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have given great difficulty . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the American aircraft manufacturers has made the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle to the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US @-@ state Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers via the USA , that are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
the h@@ emisph@@ eres was the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole was a shelf for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising earlier .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; like the wind , however , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still SPD @-@ chief was the leader of Social @-@ Democratic prime minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely does not distur@@ b your interference from the party central , just no counter@@ wind from the covenant - so the most important wish of the el@@ ectoral campaigns . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the Party , the fundamentally has changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees of the Willy Brandt @-@ House , since then , observe the events of the SPD @-@ Brandt @-@ House with growing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz did from there for the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach at the beginning of the year . &quot;
there were deep @-@ hits .
and indeed one after another .
the CD@@ U @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows more : red green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tional fraction of the Gre@@ ens MEPs took up the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a difficult crisis .
five months before the war election or its red @-@ green coalition thus lost its A @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green State leader Michael Kell@@ ner has asked the Ab@@ solu@@ te Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Green @-@ MP El@@ ke Tw@@ ests to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear del@@ usion of the par@@ aly@@ sis .
&quot; El@@ ke Tw@@ ist immediately has to return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal Minister and the campaign of the Gre@@ ens of the Green Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; but this must not be true not at all , &quot; si@@ gh@@ ed a SPD el@@ ectoral campaign than on the Friday morning , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message has reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands by the survi@@ ving of the green Members El@@ ke Tw@@ ests to the CD@@ U without its own government control . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mis@@ ery began with the un@@ expected clear defeat at the Saarland &apos;s election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , so@@ othing the comrades . &quot;
&quot; according to the national elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then - and although it has been significantly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the d@@ ull , the Düsseldorf @-@ pl@@ ains Haute the Party . &quot;
m@@ üh@@ el caught the comrades in the weeks after that .
&quot; then , when they had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ summit of Hamburg came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next attack .
&quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD @-@ country side , lost his N@@ im@@ bus because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ ately , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did so quite wrong in crisis communication , that what you can do wrong . &quot;
since then Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Prime Minister has already been in criticism since longer . &quot;
changed re@@ fr@@ age@@ values came .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps even so , Wei@@ l tried to always put more stronger in the covenant in the past weeks . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former citizenship of Hanover , to build his power in Berlin , remained intact in the environment by Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him as they gave to a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l makes no fault in the im@@ partial internal constraints , basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz did not at all .
&quot; sometimes , the comrades strive to keep its own ranks . &quot;
&quot; your wrath is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the tr@@ ap parliament@@ arians in Tw@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , such as Mrs. Tw@@ ests at their own career opportunities for the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the Party of the SPD in the SPD of the SPD ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Tw@@ ests is not for her person as a direct channel , but on the provincial list of the Lower Gre@@ ens have been elected to the parliament , so the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische MP . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they have returned their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ Bundestag , indic@@ ted a &quot; und@@ em@@ ocratic man@@ o@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ aly@@ sis shot four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Wei@@ l to the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who carries the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische SPD as a Spit@@ s@@ andi@@ dat into the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career distr@@ act of a future CD@@ U members said the W@@ ah@@ ler result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he requested to clear the backgrounds .
I want to know if there have been more or there is no additional pl@@ agues of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
convey@@ ed for the town@@ center III
who wants to rent in the years and would like to get assistance from the country soon .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once again a review of the past .
since 1991 it has been in delicate fac@@ ili@@ ation areas .
&quot; back then , in the San@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
in the refurb@@ ishment II from 2005 to 2016 the grant was still 60 percent .
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous fac@@ tions are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development , and not just to tap new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , one received the information about the Presidency of the Board of Karlsruhe , that there will be a renovation area III . &quot;
&quot; the sum total amount is € 333 , of which there are 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the church . &quot;
how does a san@@ itation area be created ?
&quot; you will continue to examine as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; truly ancient &quot; homes are . &quot;
but it also plays a role in which the planned territory would be interested in general .
if necessary the area of the territory could be moved once again .
the pier agreements on the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ eve Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; the cellar presented the contents of the Bund @-@ Coun@@ tries &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; in which the San@@ ings would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the heart of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of internal cities , improving the living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be objective , that is called per plot . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for funding funds runs since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; until September this year , however , until September this year would only be carried out to take stock , as part of those interested parties to fill out a questionn@@ aire . &quot;
in November or December the stat@@ utes of the stat@@ utes shall be done so that in the coming year with the renov@@ ations .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every Commun@@ e perform the poss@@ essed pre @-@ investigations .
it is why it &apos;s going to evaluate the urban development conditions and decide when it is done and to what extent .
there will then also be a san@@ itation in the basic book for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to delicate , and get a picture of the location , she said . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires which will be sent to citizens over the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and plot &quot; &quot; where there is among other things about the construction state and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a residential area . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operation &quot; &quot; is only permitted , if in the building business rooms are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , in mind , he pointed out that a filled questionn@@ aire is not at the same time a request for funding . &quot;
&quot; moreover , new measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funds for the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ dog &quot; &quot; work - who first comes , ma@@ ids first . &quot;
&quot; you can not make a support for later &quot; &quot; reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a rest@@ or@@ ations &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish invent@@ or puts itself a micro@@ chip to come up with a handful of movement in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ tish invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open its front door , its office and even start with a handful . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny Chip between thum@@ bs and for@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consultant An@@ a@@ es@@ thesi@@ ologists at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedures performed after medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars , that they are compatible with chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now incorporated both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers of thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a Marine hel@@ icopter to fly to the South Law@@ n for an event that the American production costs last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the data of the military that have been left to T@@ IME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One if the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17th July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the hel@@ icopter was issued in Connecticut &apos;s Hel@@ icopter , next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ wood from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from the Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the Military office of the White House demanded the presence of hel@@ icopter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the Hel@@ icopter on the South Law@@ n One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for the operation of the hel@@ icopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted that you are aware of it , because it is such an un@@ common event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; wrote the com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of the event of his su@@ peri@@ ors , Deputy Minister of Aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the Hel@@ icopter came on 17 July at 7 p.m. in the morning at the South Law@@ n for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening was vac@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the note add that if the departure should be del@@ ayed from the White House , due to the limitation of the service to a second team for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; the original flight crew was located during the event at the hel@@ icopter , while the security guard took place during the time on the ground by plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by the T@@ IME provided , did not clearly indicate whether in the end a second flight crew was needed . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits the federal property for political purposes .
records are showing that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; a question we created was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch A@@ cts , and we were informed that this was not the case , written the com@@ mander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; answered the dep@@ uty command . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was called by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political super@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave a impetus to the reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate , and he prop@@ elled the efforts for the intr@@ usion of government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advant@@ ageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
&quot; but their use only for a photo OP , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp led a study by , as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first figh@@ ter r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ Services , and his Twitter account is full of messages relating to the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products made from all 50 states , which will be made by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Head of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws lead frequently exercise flights in the area around Washington and in the South Law@@ n by the U.S. President in the White House with precise cen@@ timeters .
&quot; as Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was conducted in the White House 58 Practice land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event &quot; &quot; in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a be@@ amer . &quot;
hel@@ icopter units flew in addition 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential versions . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented on the event . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved with the hel@@ icopter on the South Law@@ n . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX 1 does not present Bud@@ get@@ design@@ ations for the presidential , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen , the Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 is the DO@@ D refund for the V@@ H 3D , but 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft in 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of the operation of the hel@@ icopter is far below this rate .
&quot; to set the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates of the refund rates , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a margin study from the year 2015 , the refund rates for DO@@ D is not included the recruitment , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former press prec@@ arious of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the hel@@ icopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things , which are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I am assum@@ ing that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think as most Americans we are all proud of the hel@@ icopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to suggest that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp with the hel@@ icopter inter@@ viewed , when he entered his tour over the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat down in the chassis of fire @-@ defence . &quot;
in the White House Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and moved with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil concert . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have had to aw@@ aken the sanctions nor by executive order to life . &quot;

part back@@ wards : the city presents 46 kitchen aids
the city has organized the K@@ ita @-@ lunch time again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a order to the team .
in the cities of day@@ care the clock will return the clock .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld , takes over the city of Kre@@ feld , in urban child@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) is back in self @-@ reg@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; for Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of Youth Movement , This is a good news : &quot; we all have very happy . &quot;
&quot; cooked , furthermore , except house : a Cater@@ er will take over this task and delivers fresh bo@@ iled . &quot;
&quot; the town operates in the fields of 46 children &apos;s activities , in 44 children get a warm meal for lunch time . &quot;
&quot; in the last Kit@@ a@@ year , 2800 children at the tables , and the need grow steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime we eat not only children , the 45 weekends @-@ hours are looked after , in the K@@ ita to noon , &quot; &quot; explained Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour support if children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time people have from the 1st of September kitchen service : they war@@ ms the sl@@ ate food , supplement them to salad , raw materials and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give the food out , clean , rin@@ se and clean@@ se the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a ch@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there is just like sev@@ enty @-@ up facilities - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ per belong now to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement pe@@ dagog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is made sense .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also task of the kitchen forces - will be done in future by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to quality improvement of the kitchen performance even the charm , which it turned out in the cost of the same between self @-@ reg@@ ie and foreign input for the city as the most economical means , it is out of the press . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 parts must be re@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; but these hours drop around 750 people in the guar@@ di@@ ans at all not so strong in the weight , &quot; says Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;

&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , acting head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will run at the provinces in the provinces . three women can@@ als for the role of vice @-@ President and more than 30 percent of new registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women are fully involved and included in all parts of the election process .
the elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5th .
&quot; the Taliban fighters against a election process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat , to a consultant role . &quot;
&quot; this year , elections for the first time , elections will be handed over to the next time by a democrati@@ cally elected government . &quot;
Hay@@ s@@ om said a strong role for women to strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .

G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ factory in Glasgow
&quot; a union would like to be at the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow . &quot;
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company s@@ ails over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ Cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which besides other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owners Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that workers and trade unions &quot; would be experienced as the first one if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s , &quot; concerns , &quot; concerns about the modernisation of production lines would not be promoted . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ witz , concerns our members deeply . &quot;
&quot; generations of families worked here and the labour forces strongly focus on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising costs of life and the chronic production of production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a thri@@ ving production of the Presidency of Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spok@@ es@@ person from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ ppo at T@@ oll@@ Cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to that since we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the staff that we operate as all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and un@@ secure economic climate , our business is regularly review - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested in our T@@ oll@@ cross location more than 5 million pounds , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we fully acknowledge the heritage of T@@ oll@@ Cross as an production site , and all of you should change our operational processes at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned three years ago from N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not sur@@ pass in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having had an offer of £ 189 million in order to trigger his bye , but have lost Barcelona three years ago before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach took the Trans@@ fer@@ a window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record by more than the double bed of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after ending the N@@ ey@@ mar , for the first player in the world and for the maximum paid professional sports@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way the N@@ ey@@ mar has been en@@ forced its way out outside the Catal@@ ans , although a spring has always given its best to take care of him since its arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of him . &quot;
but the football world was given three years ago by the PS@@ G President in front of this prospect ?
&quot; as a Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact her player , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with themselves , so this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona does not seem to have exc@@ eeded this line , with the Spanish club in the beginning of this summer , expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy , under some circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by taking one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; because he escap@@ ed a car on his suspension , the driver had to soft and touch@@ down the driver of a VW Tour@@ an . &quot;
on Thursday morning the 34 @-@ year @-@ old was from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW at 19.@@ 55 on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction Le@@ ese on the road .
&quot; in the area of the plac@@ em@@ ulation of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a truck came to him on its driving track , so that he had to turn right onto the right . &quot;
this touch@@ down the Tour@@ an @-@ driver the line plan .

&quot; it may be good , according to the information of the accident , the mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es@@ ists had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report de@@ bur@@ et Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report on the abuse of waste is the Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse scan@@ dal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ der , spok@@ es@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have expressed her profound regret about his own sub@@ mits or their time incorrect assessment of the processes . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; however , critic@@ ised that during the reporting of violence against the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; two dimensions . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , nobody knows that it would have to be pun@@ ish@@ ly and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts , &quot; &quot; the author of medi@@ al Man@@ ip@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , histori@@ ans and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that is normal for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; we are happy to go on the church and this is a ti@@ led fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; moreover , they pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; saw a quite normal educational means &quot; , &quot; to be done with fre@@ ed children , as I was one , ready to become finished . &quot;
&quot; it re@@ es it unfair , today &apos;s standards to apply to earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
in connection with reports about the abuse of abuse often also pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; totally to im@@ right , the author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s mem@@ ent@@ ment &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with the clarification of attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been used between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of transi@@ tions , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it was said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who had been active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , therefore , that von Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was applied in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotional ality , the occupation of the students could also dis@@ agree . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other def@@ endants , many sacrific@@ es the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence also associate positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in an interview , Hes@@ emann , explains the final report on the ab@@ norm@@ ali@@ ce scan@@ dal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report about the &quot; &quot; inci@@ dents of violence &quot; &quot; in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives an contradi@@ c@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for a lift many students rise up his &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the other he also appears as ch@@ intoler@@ ance and perf@@ ection@@ ist , who has been hand @-@ hand , when a domain of musi@@ cally brought no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is not at all in it . &quot;
he just had eight sides dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or ro@@ ommate in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
the ant@@ enn@@ as at the pre @-@ school is happening outside of his sphere .
it is possible to do it at any point of time to experience it too late or have not taken seriously enough obj@@ ections .
&quot; the cath@@ edr@@ als , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger offers a very excellent record , describes it as &quot; &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; understan@@ da@@ bly &quot; , &quot; the guys regularly rec@@ alled by cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons . &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ aining about its perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emotional ality which also led to tan@@ gible forces .
&quot; that he cast not only with chairs and bow@@ ed the keys and put on the ground , but also ear@@ ing guys to the hair or ears , he himself has already given years ago , deeply regret and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his honor , however , it must be said that such investig@@ ating methods have been widely spread in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 19@@ 70s , among parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think of all of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; also I have experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state @-@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the ant@@ agon@@ ists at the pre @-@ school , are the real excav@@ ators . &quot;
then you ask if it was not more likely to deal with his acquain@@ tance and his role as brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ . to do that many media just over@@ thre@@ w it .
&quot; at the Bav@@ arian Pope , many of whom have never understood it , still un@@ free@@ zing . &quot;
but the truth is : the report ent@@ ails Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report a lot about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final Report as well as any conc@@ e@@ eship or complic@@ ity in terms of sexual abuse at the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual gri@@ ps claims to have become familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dre@@ amed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; said a praying dep@@ uty for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is however that most victims are not silent .
&quot; if they were not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly does not determine a ch@@ oral leader who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ ing@@ er &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a gif@@ ted student form@@ ulated it so : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he could have had given knowledge ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely insights and could stay the respective perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , accept that themselves well ... Bub@@ bles lon@@ ging or clear@@ er or even more likely to have opened , as compared to their parents , intern@@ ships , trust , etc . &quot;
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that the students involved in advance , could not be confirmed in advance , could not be confirmed within the investigation . &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger tell about every co @-@ purpose .
&quot; thus , it cannot be thrown into , nor may it be prevented or brought to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good names with this contradi@@ c@@ ant crimes , as it was unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; ant@@ al@@ tex@@ tures &quot; &quot; to read the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is disc@@ ar@@ ded in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this fore@@ play ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything is missing and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and tissues , and somewhere , in the midst of the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; yet , precisely this is a mis@@ use of the reference . &quot;
&quot; namely clean separate : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and tissues as well as , we say once , other pre@@ di@@ als . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report has been treated during the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger does not have Chor@@ us of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful ex@@ pe@@ dagog@@ y , the cases , in which l@@ ad by s@@ adi@@ sti@@ ller @-@ regul@@ ates and det@@ ain@@ ted , sl@@ ats themselves at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous fe@@ eds have to have . &quot;
&quot; but with those who had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he only got the boys to face the face , when they were already at the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; on that was , as the most witnesses empha@@ size , the subject of &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to come to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly . &quot;
what was different from the dom@@ stat@@ ure ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline , but no s@@ adi@@ c violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims combine the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even some positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so at the end , at the end we have left to have gone away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ university . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible from the events at a school , at which he didn &apos;t want to hear and responsible , ( so the witness ) was nothing , and then again to 1993 . &quot;
Ver@@ closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral @-@ offering , which the report was even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this , he pointed out this to that in the pre @-@ school , the test will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; even in the light of the danger of negative media , he recommended the most urgent one . &quot;
&quot; of course , this was at a time when legal clarity consisted , as test form@@ ulas even in Bavaria long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , it saved themselves in a legal gray area , like everyone of us probably know . &quot;
&quot; there was too hard for him to appreciate where the affected might be ex@@ agger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the per@@ missible border had been exc@@ eeded . &quot;
&quot; but one cannot say , he would have always been bot@@ her@@ ed . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test was officially completed in schools in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Für@@ th Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is gently , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pe@@ dagog@@ ical standards to the most recent times . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans talk about the &quot; &quot; par@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger to assess times of today &apos;s moral measures . &quot;
the prin@@ cess already has right .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse at all times and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence against in@@ noc@@ ence , which goes far beyond that time out of evil . &quot;
&quot; this is all very terrible , and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked . &quot;
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in shelter for all that had nothing to do with him .
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and improvement , so ear@@ ching and ears to the hair and ears were widely spread in the 19@@ 70s . &quot;
as a physical occupation then he was also strictly forbidden .
what picture of his reg@@ ens@@ burger period has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was given in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
did the topic test for this part in the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told from his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not at all that he carried out a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once again : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the lon@@ eliness of un@@ conditional discipline , it would be hardly possible to form an institution of world @-@ known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen an institution of Wel@@ d@@ g , true cultural amb@@ assador of Europe and its musical tradition that went into tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no big singers and before each success stand equal in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ tw@@ ist . &quot;
what kind of human beings have you experienced as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks to her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through working on the book and beyond , I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , primary , deep @-@ believers and sav@@ ory good people from which one could not imagine if he could have just a fly to overcome . &quot;
&quot; I am regularly telling how many former cathedral cats still got to keep in touch with him today , 23 years after his Emer@@ ging , regularly contact him , read him - he is almost blind@@ ed and treat him as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him up to date , that he was once strict to them , are therefore clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always became a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ous teacher - a str@@ ingent Father , certainly that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ectable seed , to which they still look up today , and worship them too . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again , everything you for@@ ged , are educ@@ ators who were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and a still prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention , which stands behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eved him . &quot;
&quot; now the point of view would have acquired a 93 @-@ year man who has acquired great mer@@ its services and without the outside Bavaria , and perhaps no one would be familiar to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
