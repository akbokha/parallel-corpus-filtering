<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the government government, is anything but up-to-date."</seg>

<seg id="10">"then, the cities and municipalities are transformed in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a Flickenteppi that one sees as such is not the same.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the great picture postcard were made for towns and municipalities in more detailed cards, so-called urine leaves."</seg>
<seg id="13">These emerged according to the information of the Bavarian Verimmeasurer between 1810 and 1864 and jump to first Vermessung of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition-war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wants an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if French troops were moved with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: there were the present neighbors, who created the idea of an extensive Bavaria card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" topographic Bureau "" and thus the Bavarian Verimmeasurer. "</seg>
<seg id="19">The copyright holder for Munich dates back to 1856 from the year 1856 and is like to find all the other on the website of the Bayerische Staatslibrary.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Fruits / Today is the example of the state capital of the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was signed 21 years after the card, thus 1877 as a Münchner district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses undersprings in 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 by Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian farmer against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when Zoom out appears a small-piece card with dozens lines and numbers: handwriting numbered plots from the so-called" "urine" "from which the property tax was deduced."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small pitches today, there are no need for farmers today - but the gardener of the" land in the sun. "</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese since 1810 Schauplatz of October, was in the 19th century a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the event of the present district Au-Haidhausen, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only reads the street names" "at Gasteig" "or of the" "ight" "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once found people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner Circle-Irrenanstalt" "had emerged."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard ruled by Gudden the establishment of the psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time, and ended for example the sale of the so called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"moreover, he is forbidden to use the personnel to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients was first place, later it was expanded to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime this capacity is no longer considered - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"there since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrics Germany."</seg>

<seg id="42">"west is the football field of the TSV Munich east, east residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children-house" "Casa don Bosco" "was set to be destroyed in arrest of the country of origin of the Irrenunciation during World War II in the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was in 1856 as" "main square", "the purchase route was called" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought to the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the German Institute, small business buildings and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once on the Marienhof, where these days were the preworking and on 5 April 2017 the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn station."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the air-picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizens of Citizens publishes Reisewarming for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colabove has issued a warning for colored people who are on account of discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the State to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri, who, until 28 August 2017, calls for Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians, when travelling through the state have special attention and notice, since a number of fragile, rally-based foresees in recent times occur and here, it is stated in the position of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination authorities, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, illustrates the group that dismissal, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are raised because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such a warning issued by the organisation for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group bined incidents such as racist betrayed against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionworthy circumstances in the beginning of the year after having been taken no gasoline during the journey through the state, and taken by the police of Missouri in prison, without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the office of the General State Department of Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers will be more common in the state 75 percent more common than pasture."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff inform about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"people need to be ready whether it may bring deposits, or know relatives that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri moved into the year 2015 100 Hassan's break according to the latest numbers from the Hassle-reporting programme of the FBI, which achieves the state with regard to the number of such injuries at the 16th position of the country. "</seg>
<seg id="64">"the beekeeping is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union had published the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Reisewarnings for Texas and Arizona, the local prosecutational Authorities had to commit people because of immigration."</seg>
<seg id="66">"buses are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders has used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Pasture project is elementar</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman pasture project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag Peter White and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the leggrabance of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the fisherman CDU-local association with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann offers an insights into his company, in which he was surrounded by 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, surrounded by 40 cows and as many young animals, and in five apartments tourist guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Schwarzwaldmilch "is for him the alternating marketer away for the milk of its cows, so swivel."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the resort only Regionales comes exclusively.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fisherbach, he describes the pasture project as" elementar. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage to such a steep inclination.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area, for a lot of work, much mnuts with the motor sense are processed."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the Topographics," stressed Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the electoral operation and managed this without chemical pesticides and fertilizers, even if he does not lead to a biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the significance of the pasture project and is happy about the leader of the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers need to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the forestation of the surfaces could still be moved quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure that we have, are people who work in agriculture and make their thoughts on how they continued their operation," stressed the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of funding often</seg>
<seg id="84">The pasture promotion were fenced in 2013 in a total of 25 plots from eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure area is about 40 hectares, which can not be reforated until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total of 71 500 Euro, half of the Leader has been funded, a quarter carried away by the municipality of Fisherbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"consequently, the farmers have had 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you makes a really good job, without farmers and landfill it is not."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood firm: "here are the best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscapes (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of pastors.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black-purpose.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR-signed sponsors.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the fence area must not be smirable (hanging gradient over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman pasture project, in 2018, the request for eight participants already runs with 24 plots, which we want to build a total of 16 kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calulated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">"now, the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore carved fall of Saddam Hussone on the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did, as he did a symbolic Axt in a hitous dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic restrictions on the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">There would have been a horde of jetties and Liberty-Immediators if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid hold of their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta," I will not go here to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, which is illuminated the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem in which you refer to that later was added and not part of the original freedom of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is proper, but as he formed it himself, it is not really about story."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the emerging words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state will not only invites any old immigrants, but the troubles of the poor:" thy poor, / thy afflicted masses, who like to breathe free, / the elending waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time in which the" "drop waste" "on our screens was better to see."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed himself into literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict in the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after their death on the base - knew very good that they made a high-political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting them in an abused classical image presentation of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem is the feminine figure out more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, the people wanted to change from the right wing this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry-when Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argumented in 2010, that the free statue of Liberty nobody unlade but rather an early Neokonservative be that the American flame goes into the converted world:" Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torches should not enlighten the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something stolen.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely and a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in them to see them as they were by the exhaustive, elend, but hopeless people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships were seen."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome to hear them.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever wanted to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torches should not enlighten the path, but the hate that is their only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black loom Scottish members of the Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two villi were to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed contingent contests in the World Championship Series" will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish Athlete was chosen for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland's something special", "and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue to continue until we find it" "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish Athlete think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish Athlete are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which can compete against Sir Mo Farah during Eiliie Doyle from the team to the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was amazing," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were dirty or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the Eiliie quite naturally entered, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of Silver medal, which is in its fifth world championship with the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "is that 16 braces are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland has hitherto been the best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven, the 1983 and 2015 were achieved. "</seg>
<seg id="146">The road-runners Muir is leading on this road and has set up five British records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5.000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another sheared that one should consider after a great season which should win the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary games."</seg>
<seg id="149">"Doyle was reminded of her first World Championships, when the only other carrot was in the team Lee McConnell."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannents captain in says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their landlords are not only part of the team, but in some cases also in the medals and with the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the particular note to his team captain, lies in it that it was elected by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor to me, but to know that my team-mate have voted for me and chose me to something very special for me,"</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi, which belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to rise on pods."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain concerned?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I have only noted that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home World Championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">"it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be just as a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics via Facebook: transfer you not to a public office when you cannot wear the heaters of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers smote him because of all the internal policy up to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He shopped in criticism to be sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 said Washington:" "the freedom of expression can be taken away - and, dumm and mute, we are led as the sheep for battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to work more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendants him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the stab of the governor left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and? "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republicans Governor in a overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two thest consent of the 50 Governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He demonstrated a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to combine with its voters and playable his haired head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockages of persons who come to the side of the Governors - the public forum is known as officially, and by employees who will pay with public tax rewards - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans Amelia Speak Amelia the acts of the Governors and arguing that the blockage of the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of tropical or spasps, or hassert people who vibrate online the Peitsche."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trojan."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments respectable, thoughtful, and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The parish priests passed the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked to hate them."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other latest news," she wrote in the commentary area of the delivery "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic, then it is rather than a so-so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the Governors as "concentrated spam attack" would probably call themselves "intercede."</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a message by simply blocked a critic or a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaners than in earlier times, if you have done the same that staff have been sent to collect newspapers with critical guidelines and to burn protesters or demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what is happening at digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official which he criticized to it that he implicates Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is charged by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County Verlast the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Apostle James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she named a voters from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Mosin (R) was also a visit of the ACPI because of its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be as heavy.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time Washingtons had a similar effect like the Internet at affordable portos.</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied, between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous briefing according to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people, the pseudonyms like" Juricola "," "Belisarius", "" Belisarius "," "Belisarius", "wrote all the letters to newspapers, the Washingtons decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"Petitions, who criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and navigation with Great Britain, overcome his office, according to the historical documents, which were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought them to the silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of expression, disagreement and discourse belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club</seg>

<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, traded 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne did not packed their pockets and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I was in love in her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square-foot of the apartment was completely rebuilt."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally a one-room-property with a wasted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Joanne storage space and a mezzanine floor to optimize the generous ceiling height."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose they commissioned the Architecture and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Fan had to be creative to solve the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel mill is quite complicated," explained. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the spaces so that they were overthrown with each other, without having had to leave us."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about to build a simple platform, but the steel so that it did for the function above or down the correct height."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement makes it possible to place a fan, two spaces in full height and with a lot of extra drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic tabby spotlight from retro-window by Retrouvius via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"scored gold furniture, silken accents and vintage Serge Mouseers put the style for the program."</seg>

<seg id="1339">The kitchen feels the mirroring like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance mirrored units place for all the seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can conclude the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garment door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went there," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is object-important, so that when you push the door high, very easy glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the cleverly use of space and storage space, Joanne could win over 16 m ², an additional bedroom and a improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the plot - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate can enter and perform a calculation based on soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they managed to enlarge the ground floor and use the same high quality materials which give the room to its luxury advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and that can help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>

<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new Staburef of the White House, met his first working day with leading employees, he presented a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he would fix: poor information, who fall into the hands of the president."</seg>

<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television reaches decades of decades - and now where he is in the White House is his TV value still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when nominate Trump was annoyed because of an infair coverage was it productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince," "said the former election of Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico."</seg>

<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem is that people in a white house that sets forth out of competing parties, always trying to present their own agenda by promoting Trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultants, the president for immediate reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump like a volcano can react on negative press cuts, especially such with shovating Lecks, and that he can figure out to find out what they originate."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened in late February, when someone called the president of a printed copy of an article by Gotnew.com, the website of the internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Head of Katie Walsh," the source behind a pile of leaks to be in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson had banned from thyans from the Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he has voiced incorrect precautions and rescant it in the past."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask people about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"he added that the damar Staburef Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tries to implement a system to manage the paperm and to document the Trump. "</seg>

<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">"it was communicated to them that it is important to change their routines."</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what is safer to feel safe: you should take her children with the office, which were in 2009 the target of an attack with granite, or they were at home."</seg>

<seg id="1815">"you ask the reporter, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drugs glugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected on the obeying list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that can provoke the chaos of Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no ruins of violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are traded: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 took his office until after attacks and threats under federal law and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"under the latter, their editors and their aspirator of Riodoce, the Co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest error is to be in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of its numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack is felt deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, that is located on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear the t-shirts together with glasses, or its typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their nightmarry, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 has been established a Sonder federal Prosecutor, in order to process the cases of journalists, according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with the most thousands of morals, which are linked every year with drug dealers and organised crime, the murderers of journalists will rarely be placed in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they are still struggling to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting, and although the terrain is still oblique."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meetings for the discussion of security, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very dumm to waste my time in this workshop," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why we understand it all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks far before his rotating Toyota Corolla was raised by two men. he was forced by his car and 12 times was shot to him, probably due to the name of the newspaper - the" "Zwölfter river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap was driving away in his car and damaged it close.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He deposited a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to be free in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans reduction in the last year and the delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rivalled political groups are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't make sure that in Sinaloa each day somebody or several people are shot on the street, or that the cemetery is full of verings, two-storey mice for drug-rounder, which are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" peace "if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs-routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings has contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rifucking mapping transactions in the war with Guzmans."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have denied the sons, suspected Ganglion bought each copy of the output, as soon as they delivered to Zeitungskioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, leaving the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend of Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survives that his friends and colleagues annahmen that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as a senior Reporter for Noroeste as he joined together with five colleagues on the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate a journalism without repainable problem, said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"at the time the newspaper served a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and promotion."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter lover it, hard treffled investigations without fear of censorship and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories, no one else was to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce they received the prestige of "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, where ever they led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue working," he said at the time of CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug dealers in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You need to take on the task which falls you as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," What have you done so many dead... why did you not say what happened before? "</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team miss Valdez, the spaßbird, the like a port workers curse, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher, who knew how to overlives."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayana, the bar opposite the office, and always sitting at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now, ask her: was his love to be a routine?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has forced them to ask her own assumptions in question, how they can do their work best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their own clean shops, their furious start and cross-cars" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even at the best times, a high level of self-ship and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instinct.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it is wrong, keep away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell a sense that can be getaway... and then the thing is happening with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no longer - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government offices."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space where staff of Riodoce met for security training, there were suddenly no manuals allowed. days before has been known that Spyware was sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>

<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in jokes, some of the reporters asked, whether these officers are among the 50 percent of the policemen belong to the governor itself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months her, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drugs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has spread to three main stories.</seg>

<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri-Gouverneure were accused because of the top cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporters to write about previous incidents in this Local, including a place in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman took a military overfall."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months ago, the reader had seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the best informed source about the abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had already known what happened is," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slim body composition. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the Morde of journalists who have become something that they have never expected, what they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor."</seg>

<seg id="1893">"she has been asked for this reason that it is once again divided by the government, because it is concerned that their woe has injured their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico is organized by organised crime, a involved government and a consistent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco-Journalism" "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drugs, but also on command from politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>

<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something which seemed from the surrounding rock in the platter, and decided to see more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">He discovered that by him Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"you spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work the finished result is ready to be unveiled, unveiled."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just got a little with the eyes flashes, you could almost believe that it slept," the main author Caleb Brown, scientists in the Royal Tyrrell museum where the creature has to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies - the mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that these plant eaters have been covered, although he is covered with an armor and a changing tank, probably threatened by flesh and sending dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology that is used as a counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to soften his enemies, say, what is threatened by greater dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs has made headlines in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers now studied the wild animals and it Borealopelta markchelli named after the Museumstechnics Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7.000 hours with it to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the conquerading, a widespread defence method in the animal, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than their side."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the contershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta are by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted by sufficient pressure by meat eater dinosaurs, that the evolution had favoured the confrontation of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals who use the contemorting - think of deer, zebras or Hip-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as a booty, which was signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong prey behaviour on a massive, strongly grounded dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs carnivores have been of the chalk-time," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skals also shows that the skin of the dinosaur is red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal in references about his life, including his preserved intestinal, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs died, when he died in a river and driven out into the sea, where he turned on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was so warm like south florida today, and rivers and oceans probably more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with contrasting skin, but also kept in three dimensions and the original form of animal shelter," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost exactly as it looks like in the early war period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to reconstruct it. if you're just a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk period was a time, as huge Theropods, carnivorous dinosauction, which stood on two legs, the earth crossed."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, was destroyed by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six ton hares monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings in the magazine Current Biology will appear, believe that Borealopelta is flank after death in the sea and in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the reserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armaments, and is completely from the muzzle to the hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">"it contained two 20-inch-long tops, which dominated by its shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-eaters was curved by the Western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater consignment of the dinosaur-kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the janitest are still bumped tank-plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">How Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic is such a level of preservation so rarely like a gain in the lotto.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"only one day after they arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis Prayer on the bed of a Airbnb flat, which they rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it is still on the road, called it there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as no one else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly on its timeline retweet.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"Rapha from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year-olds, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., was killed, live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns alive body that was outstretched on the road and stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild, I thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone to return later in the evening to get to Tweets over people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people, the crying, and by a man who carried out, who carried a sign with the wording:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They observed a live feed in which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellished dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, said another Polizist his rifle and cried," I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual, reminded Ferrell to their statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and that we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return trip and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock they took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "" in the cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestant, the love and loss of power, the strength and resistance of resistance, who are living in the community and the streets filled to challenge answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two have a conversation that she had countless times before this morning, about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you reminded you how I taught you when black people have to fight for the fight, what they believe?" reminded them of what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year boys and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them away," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You must know it and be reared and moved it into it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have good luck to give her an experience in which they personally have no ekled racism, it is not different from the next black women."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them off."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived at Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground, when the activists has been waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owners who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism started for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after the 9th August completely," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black churches. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in organizing."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the Co-director of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her companionship Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to only document what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell in the sense:" "you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently declared in an interview:" we heard that people who have been born in Ferguson and grew up their voices, and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for its activism around deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his dedication brought the project nearer, along with six other natives followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years to Browse shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because so will I be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it is in the movement" not about a messiah guide, but about a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as she likes and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that it has to give a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells has history the role of black pregnant women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which have shaped the film" "BlacklivesMatter" "in social media in 2012 identify the film" "BlacklivesMatter" "in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, pregnant women must carry the main last of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan unanimously to notice that "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it exists however, however, that this is not a affirmatical type of action is," at the Ferrell chosen as the heart of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because in a life on these crosses as a black, pregnant woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras disappeared from Ferguson has long gone, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on nutrition for 2 ½ years due to the blockage of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area, which they called their homes:" a mess. "</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she feels at a singing and she feels committed to this memorial, since they went into the street three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people even though it is not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian precinct has been obsolete since the first presentation 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the theme is hardly possible."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook-Page" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say:" that would be a dream "" (Anja Becker) or "" this would be genuine "" (Nicole Schausten), "from the other side:" needs no human being "(Siggi Bsetting) or quite simply:" "Sizing!" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates insists that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which the other business will benefit, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian precinct."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery will be planned exactly on the property, in which the market hall stands, in the 13 direct market marketed its products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of construction work there will be a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a markethin to the new building - and for the need for a Beda place with the possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been playing almost weekly in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the land are always happy to be very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that also during and above all after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there are also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct market marketed in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the height of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this is likely to be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what to shopping in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"ob Clothing, shoes, Drogerie- or supermarkets: I find this superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"of which, there is already enough in our city."</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shopstores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but there is still not even a decent weekend market, it is the more important that we at least remains at least the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods delivered there is fresh, mostly delivered directly from the producer and is obendlessly inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shopstores are reserved in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the dorm Rent are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special shops are almost no longer and what still exists, will probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall fits for me not.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where is the farmers market hall during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in duration when the bit gallery is actually coming out.</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or creates the gpest bit gallery before, all stores from Bitburg to expel?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, needs no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmers market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farm hall give it thanks to the wahny many - as I find - sensual construction projects in Bitburg is no room anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is made, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost inverse, on the cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were made by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupaway and hair-sections that have been sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning schicked the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence company analysing a 35-year warranties, after it has been regarded as geheim diplomatic reports on the website WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition which was opened on 2nd August, means A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed their expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a Transwife and discrepent discourses, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extracted by Manning and made of the 30 portraits as someone can be interpreted by these genomic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the intougher determinism of these interpretations - but also to the identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, which was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly since their puberty on the identification as a woman, 2013 was condemned because of 20 charges, including six clashes against the spying network, computer was and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a baskets, black-white selfie, in the Manning becomes apparent uncomfortable on a driving seat and a platinum blonde is carrying - with which it was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012-project 'stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this produced the artist portraits of foreigners from forensic artefacts such as cigarette blunt and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a Zeitagazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"she led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press show of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artists in and their indeshalted Muse were interfered to unequal bricks that interfates several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"she even illustrated one by Shoili Canungo illustrates Comic" Suppressed images, "which would be a future predicted in which the President Chelation judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days, after the book was published to challenge the release of release after seven brutal years in a military anxious in Kansas, was a welcome type of happenings."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deeper and Starkes, since Donald Trump causes a war against informants from the government camps and against transgender-troops to find new, Tweetable ways to fix the rigid divisions, which he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg after the strange timing of all these things was asked, she said that" things from a certain reason happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery written Manning called Manning with their oversized signature including (the" "i" "in their surname is provided with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and GS and As, written in pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, describing the inclusion of the 200 letters (or Nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), like amazing similar, at least in biological ways, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully bring about it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Span Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition which is stored in an own room is a page from the above mentioned Comic Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows manning, as it appears with a free preach phone in the hand from the disciplines of the United States such as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they speak your speech, then they have won it," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote me," "said the artist, which greet people from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I always come up goosebumps, when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition - as it was prescient in the comic book, but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room from the masks, of their own genomic simulation, which collaped themselves like hormone products."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also oriented, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplogistic groups were written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted that it feels like a mass movement that feels with Chelsea, as the movement, which is also hidden behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought that there cannot be a crazy player, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) has published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeried Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eyebink of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingers."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey in the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern sex lips have developed from their inflatable partners to robotic with a silicon skin, who feels warm to feel warm - with deliberately human reaction, which can be achieved through artificial intelligence."</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robots according to his beliefs" and select everything, from the eyecurity of the robot to the type or color of his fingers. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still worrying, as many robots have the" personalities, "which would be a steppe-woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robots makes it possible for example to adjust its users, their robots on the properties which they can be appealing, for example, for example."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is still the True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold sex robots with pre-programmed figures such as" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of drawers and" "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality. "</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible, warms the site of True Companion."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she does not like what you do not like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also gave her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixed to conversation or she can be" in the mood. ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subserviced female attributes, when you move a step towards Frigid (is here: contradictory) farrah, undisturbed one of the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a Vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then do not have roxxxy?" "it is called on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sexist."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement indicate a little darker and deeper understanding in our culture to a retreat from the Perfect of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course keep no sex robots, and while the FRR notice its increasing popularity, they still remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what emerges from the boundary zones, can be in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, very educational."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not weird or obscary, until they have the free market with this permission."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"but there is a certain overcuts that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which it has undergone a president in the White House that has undergone women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the smelled body and the expressive eyes, but how realistic this vision acts."</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a dip but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity with actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want to feel human being human to imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but to put on the point when it comes to their" figures, "the robots are no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You cannot separate or go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no placement or a background story, nothing, which could disturb on independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of dead subjugation."</seg>

<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component has been purified out of the liquid, it proved to be known as a by-product of the Tryptophan-Metabolism, which is known as an Indol-3-acid acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the forage of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophansepulses were halted, sank the number of cells around half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. in our stomach-intestinal tractors."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-side-products from L. reuteri the cells in humans develop as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammattresses."</seg>

<seg id="2887">"the police are now witnesses of the preacher, as well as the driver of the contracting experience, under Tel. 05761 / 92060 with the Commissioner in Stolzenau."</seg>
<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-report deburet Pope Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-report on the abuse of waste is the Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weissender, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church, "explained by the former Regensburger bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would have expressed her profound regret about his own submits or their time incorrect assessment of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"in contrast, the" "Osservatore Romano", "however, criticised that during the reporting of violence against the Domspatzen with" two dimensions. "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the grips in Regensburg, nobody knows that it would have to be punishly and shameful acts," "the author of medial Manipulation", "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion that is normal for normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" we are happy to go on the church and this is a tiled frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"moreover, they pointed out that in her youth" "saw a quite normal educational means", "to be done with freed children, as I was one, ready to become finished."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it rees it unfair, today's standards to apply to earlier decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about the abuse of abuse often also pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally to imright, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger's mementment" My brother of the Pope "(in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protecting," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report which was presented by the diocese Regensburg with the clarification of attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen have been used between 1945 and early 1990s" "with high plausibility" victims of transitions, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it was said to Georg Ratzinger, who had been active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, therefore, that von Domkapellmeister R. was applied in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotional ality, the occupation of the students could also disagree."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many sacrifices the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases despite violence also associate positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in an interview, Hesemann, explains the final report on the abnormalice scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr Hesemann, the 440-pages report about the" "incidents of violence" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives an contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for a lift many students rise up his" "humanity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other he also appears as chintolerance and perfectionist, who has been hand-hand, when a domain of musically brought no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger is not at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He just had eight sides dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of the mid- or roommate in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The antennas at the pre-school is happening outside of his sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to do it at any point of time to experience it too late or have not taken seriously enough objections.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the cathedrals, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - as literally -" salvation, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger offers a very excellent record, describes it as" "warm", "" competent "," "competent", "" competent "," "competent", "" competent "," "competent", "and" "understandably", "the guys regularly recalled by cakes, biscuits and bonbons."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complaining about its perfectionism and its high emotional ality which also led to tangible forces.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he cast not only with chairs and bowed the keys and put on the ground, but also earing guys to the hair or ears, he himself has already given years ago, deeply regret and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his honor, however, it must be said that such investigating methods have been widely spread in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents like with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think of all of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"also I have experienced this in a secular school, a state-Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and the antagonists at the pre-school, are the real excavators."</seg>
<seg id="2926">Then you ask if it was not more likely to deal with his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedikt XVI. to do that many media just overthrew it.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope, many of whom have never understood it, still unfreezing."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report entails Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report a lot about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the Final Report as well as any conceeship or complicity in terms of sexual abuse at the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual grips claims to have become familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dreamed to speak with my father or my mother," said a praying deputy for the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is however that most victims are not silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even parents and siblings, then certainly does not determine a choral leader who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a gifted student formulated it so: "concerning sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he could have had given knowledge (Georg Ratzinger) timely insights and could stay the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd, accept that themselves well... Bubbles longing or clearer or even more likely to have opened, as compared to their parents, internships, trust, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that the students involved in advance, could not be confirmed in advance, could not be confirmed within the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned is Georg Ratzinger tell about every co-purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be thrown into, nor may it be prevented or brought to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good names with this contradicant crimes, as it was unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media was much of" "antaltextures" "to read the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is discarded in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this foreplay?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything is missing and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and tissues, and somewhere, in the midst of the Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"yet, precisely this is a misuse of the reference."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely clean separate: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and tissues as well as, we say once, other predials."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report has been treated during the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger does not have Chorus of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful expedagogy, the cases, in which lad by sadistiller-regulates and detainted, slats themselves at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous feeds have to have."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those who had Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he only got the boys to face the face, when they were already at the ground floor."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, as the most witnesses emphasize, the subject of" Vorschule "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to come to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the domstature?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but no sadic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims combine the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even some positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so at the end, at the end we have left to have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-university."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible from the events at a school, at which he didn't want to hear and responsible, (so the witness) was nothing, and then again to 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Verclosed Georg Ratzinger in front of states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral-offering, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he pointed out this to that in the pre-school, the test will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in the light of the danger of negative media, he recommended the most urgent one."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course, this was at a time when legal clarity consisted, as test formulas even in Bavaria long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, it saved themselves in a legal gray area, like everyone of us probably know."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was too hard for him to appreciate where the affected might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one cannot say, he would have always been bothered."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test was officially completed in schools in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Fürth Gloria of Thurn und Taxis gently, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the most recent times."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" "parstrick of Anachronism", "thus the danger to assess times of today's moral measures."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess already has right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse at all times and not for what was broken in the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocence, which goes far beyond that time out of evil."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all very terrible, and I am glad that it will finally be reworked."</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in shelter for all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and improvement, so earching and ears to the hair and ears were widely spread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical occupation then he was also strictly forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his regensburger period has Georg Ratzinger was given in the conversations with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic test for this part in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, since the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not at all that he carried out a stricter regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without the loneliness of unconditional discipline, it would be hardly possible to form an institution of world-known Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of Weldg, true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition that went into tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, one makes no big singers and before each success stand equal in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-twist."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of human beings have you experienced as Georg Ratzinger in the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through working on the book and beyond, I have experienced Georg Ratzinger really very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, primary, deep-believers and savory good people from which one could not imagine if he could have just a fly to overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I am regularly telling how many former cathedral cats still got to keep in touch with him today, 23 years after his Emerging, regularly contact him, read him - he is almost blinded and treat him as a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him up to date, that he was once strict to them, are therefore clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always became a good, väterous teacher - a stringent Father, certainly that may be - but also a lovely respectable seed, to which they still look up today, and worship them too."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again, everything you forged, are educators who were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and a still prominent brother to make a medial sinner."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention, which stands behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieved him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the point of view would have acquired a 93-year man who has acquired great merits services and without the outside Bavaria, and perhaps no one would be familiar to know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
