J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this is un@@ ambiguous since the Hollywood star in an interview now .
&quot; I always put stuck in drawers , or testi@@ fy from the outside label to have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather schn@@ apps . &quot;
&quot; J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only lau@@ gh it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; , &quot; as stated in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; for the white gl@@ ut they bring the question of the child &apos;s request : &quot; &quot; we women need to be married or have children to be perfect , so the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s game &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a all@@ one @-@ out mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from the 25th of August .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger looking for some colleagues a bit variety with a horseback riding on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses were remembered their celebrations , they hunt in the fast g@@ stop back home to the feeding . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I have been afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the hor@@ semen ended up then again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament walks - close to horses .
he didn &apos;t let himself lead to his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse and not for photographs .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was really convin@@ cing .
the German sports assistance exc@@ eeded the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small Gala Golden pyramid .
&quot; in distin@@ ctions , it is insufficient for the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already touched him .
long is the 18th prize winners of the pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means to me very much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for spor@@ ty achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has promoted the off@@ spring .
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money from 25,000 Euro to the same . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold U.S. master@@ head was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German sport . &quot;
&quot; the excellent include the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ ete Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ ner Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ dok@@ a Frank Wien@@ eke , the J@@ dok@@ a Frank Wien@@ eke , the Spr@@ inkl@@ er Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ ö@@ hle and pos@@ th@@ um of the wr@@ ist of all Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men had arrived on Saturday to Aachen .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ate society went into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the large animals .
Cl@@ int@@ ons and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and to prevent the Trade Agreement T@@ TP - this want to both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; moreover , the two US presidential competition are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the report on the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt more small and war@@ ned of how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; Clinton wants to put the economy to death and regul@@ ating death , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it would be quite different , claims tur@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely return regul@@ ators , and he makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax @-@ treasures strong - for individuals and for businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton against it says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and need money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes would increase for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the m@@ nuts will be invested , say Tru@@ mp and Clinton almost wor@@ m . &quot;
the democratic applicants still announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly ref@@ used by the state @-@ wars of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
in Tru@@ mp thus they could not be party for internal discussions .
more clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power stations and up@@ lift coal production in the US .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas that wants to cancel the Treaty of mi@@ tigation Agreement .
&quot; on the contrary , Clinton wants to strengthen and calls for the renewable energies in their investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ et trade agreements , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate from international trade - but simply protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; these should be paid even better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp will do in this question is not quite clear : once , he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ally , then he says he will not be altered . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand stands Tru@@ mp , which wants to boost the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold him before , so the bud@@ get@@ ary would only be even bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton , who want to demand at least by the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every escape woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who fle@@ e alone almost to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen sit four women .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
a small son was placed in the arm .
he was curious with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother died on the table top .
until they notice that they will be observed .
you sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ sing the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is a department of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are fle@@ ed .
they live in Mün@@ ch@@ ner north in one of the few de@@ centralized shel@@ ters for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the institution with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Women &apos;s Aid .
&quot; long , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ agger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has done on her escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
men fle@@ e because of wars because they are politically persec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as hop@@ per for Europe she tells them .
&quot; in women some other reasons for the flight : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in her homeland they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honorary murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs are asking for example for a bottle of water a sexual act is not rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they were in Germany , ear@@ re , tells . &quot;
also here the women in refuge@@ e accommodations are often considered as a min@@ der@@ wer@@ y and the worst event .
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women that live in Mün@@ ch@@ ner north , trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so normal that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; or they are not afraid to speak openly about the experiences , because the sheep is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they are often not helping to help wi@@ fi@@ sts , you need more accommodations only for them , calling . &quot;
the seven district governments in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; on the question , whether from a similar project like in Munich , in its jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are so something in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben are not separated alone women alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spok@@ es@@ person of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some common accommodations or houses only for all @-@ related women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommo@@ dated separated from men .
&quot; in a study which was published to the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or will find men and women together , it can come to - continuous - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; as much the women need to feel the need for this protection , it is possible to read at the An@@ d@@ rank , which there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since you talked to us , we have a long wa@@ ist box , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
general practitioner : demands on new labour measures
&quot; Deputy of the wiz@@ ards have inv@@ oked their union , new labour measures with their disputes regarding a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded his entire Council , starting at the beginning of September more labour measures . &quot;
&quot; J@@ DC , said that there would be minist@@ ered to address the concerns of the contract . &quot;
assistance and medical trainers have agreed in July about the rejection of a contract with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday , on Thursday , said the President of J@@ DC cub@@ its Mc@@ Court , that the government would have remained quiet , which resulted in that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; it said , &quot; &quot; given the J@@ DC committee to fully reject the proposed new contract , reject the proposed new treaty and be worried about all of the concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the Swiss government , the J@@ DC committee has provided a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a further program of escal@@ ating labour measures , beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that Assi@@ stance of this year was formed , the first total break@@ down in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the director of the BM@@ A Assistant Prof. Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , following the election to ref@@ us@@ al of the agreed terms of contract , which were recommended by BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he divided to BM@@ A members during the session , which took place before the vote of 54.@@ 000 assist@@ ants and medi@@ ums , with that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced in total . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of aliens &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but as Vladimir Putin his Turkish counter@@ part in the golden hall of St. Pet@@ ers@@ burger Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I can not reb@@ ate myself that Ankara wants to reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the envel@@ ope , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin in sm@@ iles , car@@ alli@@ ble and he can hardly ry warmth , even for his reserved relationships . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , however , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I could no longer count it .
&quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better . &quot;
&quot; the next day I described a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an had heard that Erd@@ og@@ an , as would never be something worst . &quot;
to me the enthusiasm of enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin showed radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the State of Russia had forgotten anything . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the down@@ cast of a Russian struggle on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow in response to time was v@@ ut@@ ent@@ ment .
Putin shared and acc@@ used Ankara to like Russia in the back .
the failure was even bigger because it was committed by a alleg@@ edly friend .
&quot; it &apos;s going to rebuild it again , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media led a fier@@ ce un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
&quot; once it seemed , the Turks seemed to bear the Turks for everything to blame . &quot;
&quot; most importantly were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials , that Erd@@ og@@ an has benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state . &quot;
he has denied this veh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it is time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erd@@ og@@ an received the exc@@ use that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could win a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are clearly obvious . &quot;
&quot; Erd@@ og@@ an needs all friends , which he can get , after spending last month at a failed state of almost his ministry . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is gone by almost 90 % .
in Russia travel agency and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are resum@@ ed .
you count on a delay in the Tower of the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week predic@@ ted the state remot@@ ely cheap fruits and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ ost@@ i formed it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West since it considers its reaction to the tried of power over a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the ongoing Gro@@ ll come about the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it is to pull out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara with certainty , the Russian state of states won a bonus that he called for the state @-@ rich support for the elected state organ@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ made for Moscow , a self @-@ compreh@@ ension , which itself has a profound fear of rain @-@ change . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this amazing palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one , as it was an an@@ alysts once described , &quot; &quot; Alliance of aliens &quot; &quot; : two countries that treat themselves from the West and are now poor@@ ly treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference in Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey are oppos@@ ing sites . &quot;
&quot; it could be granted , that after nearly three hours of first discussions on press conference , they said that they would not even have stopped the subject . &quot;
the President of Turkey res@@ ed it on a question of their differences while Putin decided to empha@@ size this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a perfect dispute as the NATO member of Turkey &apos;s Russian martial arts - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will speak at least one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the board of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the brand R@@ BS with the global ambitions of the bank .
the bank has since stand@@ off@@ ish itself than she had to be almost coll@@ eg@@ ated and saved for eight years ago .
&quot; at this time have br@@ anded &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; to protect other end@@ consumer brands . &quot;
it supported the international sport with millions of pounds to Sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ bl@@ edon champion Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralized Head@@ quarters and the stock market will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private client business that get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be employed at our Invest@@ or@@ en@@ brand as well as the brand that our employees will be busy , as we are now going to become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank became a global brand , R@@ BS has become a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say that we are not saying no global goals , but to pursue local goals . &quot;
each of these marks will be entirely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will be the Six Nations sponsorship no longer and that it will increase the perception of the different brands in its sport sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop yourself to the Bank of the brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the board . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ ally three years ago when we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would like these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can watch these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achiev@@ es its 3.@@ 000@@ th prize at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spr@@ inkl@@ ed Champ@@ agne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize &quot;
the Jo@@ ck@@ ey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori super@@ vised by Friday its 3.@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market .
&quot; he sat on pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year Italian Itali@@ ans is the sixth Jo@@ ck@@ ey which reaches the milestone in the flat @-@ run .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ go@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who recently won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy about that it has occurred at New@@ market because I &apos;ve been working here for 30 years ago .
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is an ban@@ ana Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he gets the victory on pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in obstacles - Jo@@ ck@@ ey Richard Johnson and the re@@ tired 20 @-@ fold winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a rebel@@ lion . &quot;
L@@ ester Pig@@ go@@ t the ninth der@@ y Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 Car@@ rier
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ck@@ ey of the modern age and there is no surprise that he has reached this milestone only a few before him .
&quot; it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that diff@@ ers him from the other in the weight control room . &quot;
he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for races ; his enthusiasm and char@@ isma loved fans already for years for this sport .
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already been a 6@@ ,000 winn@@ ings if he would not only be a Week@@ end and Gros@@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ck@@ ey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered nearly 30 years of winner in the UK .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race , but beyond that he is an incredible yo@@ ck@@ ey . &quot;

&quot; the Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the em@@ bodi@@ ment of British flat r@@ enn@@ as for two decades . &quot;

&quot; three years ago he had in the beginning with difficulty , when he returned from his six @-@ month semen , but he showed an impressive characteristic to def@@ y its branches and to return to his order . &quot;
and he is not yet long at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori formerly said that he wants to continue with cont@@ ests until his at least 50.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin hum@@ ert Stab@@ ur@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released its Stab@@ ili@@ zers Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years part of the nar@@ ro@@ est confidentiality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin arranged without giving reasons &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian president . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o was appointed to his successor since 2012 Ivan@@ ka was appointed .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 1972 born in the Estonian capital Tallinn , he made his gradu@@ ation at the renowned governmental Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) , and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin ( in Russian ) it is ( in Russian ) that he later sper@@ son the manager and executive manager of the government .
&quot; about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state , and to support controls for implementing your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV broad@@ cast@@ er on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the ridicul@@ ous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the narrow confidential Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works like it for the Soviet Secret Service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as a Stab@@ ili@@ ef he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both males stated that the Stab@@ ur@@ ef can withdraw from their own desire . &quot;
&quot; but despite the weak@@ ling for the cameras , here are just a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
&quot; here , there is a consequence of a kind of power @-@ battle ? &quot;
this is currently no one knows .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once pointed out as a potential president , to once the Russian environmental policy - came across great skep@@ tic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin who are c@@ ited on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov &quot; It is true that I have asked her very complicated post in early 2012 - one could almost say - compl@@ aining for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turned out , I have been chairman of the Russian president for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Council .
&quot; in the late 1990s , as Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , which was appointed the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his dep@@ uty . &quot;
&quot; he called his power to the power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , to whom he taught the most familiar . &quot;
&quot; once was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become a second term president of Russia , as a third term for Putin would have b@@ lown up against the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , near allies Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before joining the president for a three and a half years later .

puzzles around Pis@@ ces that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff requested with the identification of the fish help in his garden in Ban@@ ff .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four verses of the &quot; &quot; breeding @-@ b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ rop@@ es . &quot;
the £ 1,35 billion project should be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; economic tank K@@ eit@@ h Brown took a visit today and was one of the first , who went out from the country onto the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
we are all witnesses of an engineer of a truly ep@@ ic measure in this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sl@@ edge is between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the inc@@ ess@@ ant activity , which require extremely accurate toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; overall , almost 79 % of the total post@@ ure are at its place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks today gets a Bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place . &quot;
Michael Martin , Project Le@@ aders of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first con@@ federation represents a significant milestone in each bridge . &quot;
this fantastic project marks the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ oriented and deep @-@ building .
&quot; after installation of the last road area and its connection with the north @-@ deck area , we had to close the existing gap in the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern tribut@@ ary bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive since the Vi@@ a@@ duct is 222 metres long , approx . 6@@ ,000 tons weighs and when a gradient of approx . 3 % to be moved upwards . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances , as the toler@@ ances worked on which the team works , win@@ zig were - on every page they buried only a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have to be lucky on life &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; happiness or being alive &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew had observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulty to swim while her boat moves from their own strength .
&quot; we saw , as the boat turned around , and put us the worst before , &quot; said the leader of the lif@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds is already working out of their reach until we left water until we added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and at one bu@@ oy without a lif@@ egu@@ ard . &quot;
they arrived all on board of the coastal area and were brought back to the b@@ ail@@ out station
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water , have luck un@@ occupied and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot@@ engine had a cl@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , however , this rede@@ emed itself at the Ken@@ yon of the Bo@@ ots of the person , who controls the boat . &quot;
someone has got today about these men today .
seriously in@@ ju@@ red - man sti@@ cking on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and sever@@ ely in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; like the police yesterday afternoon , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to get to get his personal things . &quot;
instead of the non@@ alcoholic perpet@@ rators the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; when this entered into the apartment , he was twice on her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was in@@ ju@@ red by the hand and at the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ olds , the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ arm@@ rests of his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old had wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that &apos;s why she went out of her house with her life @-@ mate .
on the road they met the ex @-@ habitats of the man .
&quot; when the two women betra@@ yed the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and hold his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds a cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green Party : investors should continue to be much stronger in future than the future .
how does one react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD defe@@ ats the next council meeting a &quot; action concept &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but contro@@ vers@@ y is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is not lacking .
&quot; SPD @-@ Group Leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as soci@@ etal housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be established in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the great dispute point in the city hall is however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; how does one go with investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want to increase investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments as soci@@ etal housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing system , which will cost millions of costs and must be financed and must be financed to incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left continues to har@@ s@@ hness for investors .
&quot; regardless of this , as Brat@@ mann , ba@@ it a tight@@ ening of the situation on the market . &quot;
&quot; if the need for action is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the management administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the professionals .
&quot; but still the program is not entirely : because the around 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built in any case . &quot;
but how does one resem@@ bles the loss of further about 1,@@ 1300 apartments which will run in the coming years ? &quot;
there will be 500 apartments alone by 2020 alone .
&quot; to prevent this , as the plan@@ atory spok@@ es@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we would have to think again , apartments back to the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the west city .
on one stroke will solve the problem .
&quot; for in the west city , there is an end to the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; some 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price of cheap apartments there . &quot;
&quot; only : this would like the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; for the number of social housing in the West city will rise again dramatically , one step away from the target of the so @-@ called bl@@ ending . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social weak in just a few districts , it should no longer give . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens do so that there will be a movement in the discussion .
&quot; Group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be with the boat . &quot;
this is concentrated on more construction sites for family @-@ family dw@@ ell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world changed .
&quot; that teen@@ ager and child can no longer go outside , but rather they prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , was charged in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about to pick people from the sofa and become active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I remove myself naturally to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters which were created initially for video games in the 1990s ( later created it a cartoon , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of popular culture , the interest before publication of the game in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries has been shif@@ ted by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
spend less days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players will go out with their smartphone outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they were once found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , closed to the w@@ ahn and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the USA the game led to a considerable rise in steps , which put the &quot; average &quot; person each day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch , the 3@@ 5.000 users followed , distributed the Washington Post recently with that within two days of market launch of the game , the number of followed people , which takes 30 percent to 53 percent by 45 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only provides the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring about 30 minutes to come &quot; &quot; from the sofa to come &quot; &quot; to be active each day , because many public messages are boring and people come to look . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the significance of sport can not be reviewed . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport drives , reduces its chances , to cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful thing of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people even join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always there is also cosm@@ opol@@ y game that must always complain about something .
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what should &apos;s ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps as Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success there will be more games to unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ism in the real world and help many people in the hunt are active , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Old Testament
forget the printing .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the imm@@ un .
dynamic on the spr@@ ing@@ horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on gan@@ ter line brilliant .
and finally the Olympi@@ asi@@ erin .
the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi@@ point title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world from all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 lay clearly in front of the Silver medal of the Silver medal and &quot; Final Five &quot; &quot; Mann@@ er@@ k@@ amer@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze Medal , Ali@@ ya Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es showed Bil@@ es , on the Swedish bal@@ ancing of women at the Olympic summer in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als , which wins a multi @-@ day title and has a total of the fifth , while they rap@@ ed their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in t@@ ears as its final result was shown , and their long journey at this moment took a end . &quot;
this success makes it the same le@@ ague like a unique ath@@ l@@ ete such as Michael P@@ helps to put their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has domin@@ ates the last three years their sport , 15 World Championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises , that the Olymp@@ ics of 1984 Mary Lou Res@@ on of her said that she was &quot; the best Tur@@ ner@@ in , which I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected them a final test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , after they have the gold and silver in the single multi@@ war@@ ri@@ al of women at the Olympic summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es was the first medal on Tuesday , while at the far@@ ewell party who served in retirement team @-@ coordinating team coordination in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ ly insi@@ sted during their long journey to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of its soil exercises which are included with its typical tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music that would be at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by their grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing in the gym , was trained in the bu@@ or@@ man , became the power . &quot;
&quot; she has no more lost since the summer of 2013 , a winning series , which will keep as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina was easily conducted by two screen@@ ings , the image . &quot;
float bal@@ ances and bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Cup title - lau@@ ght .
she hol@@ ged back with 15,@@ 433 on the float again - and sat down with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor yet another .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man um@@ ar@@ ming them gently when they were expecting her grand@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and t@@ ears currents on Bil@@ es sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner as the vision that they once used in their collection @-@ book , to reality . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when they fought for the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ r@@ ake went to Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina . &quot;

&quot; after their soil she cast them to the audience Kus@@ sh@@ lands , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that was sometimes doub@@ ted . &quot;

police : 3 victims in series production in the music shot in the car
&quot; according to the police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series production of Phoenix , while staying in the car and listening to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12th June , while the car was par@@ ked in a driv@@ eway , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator hydr@@ ated eight shots from a glo@@ ve w@@ affe , while he stood on the vehicle side of the car and then fled to another vehicle , is available in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police divided the fact that the triple murder would not seem to be the result of a smo@@ kers , since the att@@ acker does not have the hand@@ bags , or the $ 2,@@ 900 who took possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ z@@ eis@@ pre@@ cher from Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators have lost , a close look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , primarily in h@@ isp@@ anic residen@@ ces were killed within four months in nine attacks seven people and two more viol@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , shared Howard K@@ HP@@ O , an affiliate of CB@@ S , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles including a brown gl@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refuse to meet the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized because of their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities published also a police report about the shooting , which went on an empty pick@@ up truck for half an hour before the triple murder , and from that it was the work of the serial port . &quot;
investig@@ ators found patches and super@@ vis@@ es an sphere from the seat as well as ball frag@@ ments from the motor room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it is better !
&quot; as most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his retirement enjoyed Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during their pregnancy did nothing . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought , I don &apos;t want . &quot;
I don &apos;t change this .
I don &apos;t let me left .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has dropped to it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her has been informed that Ed@@ mund they can never know under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they sei@@ ze him to be institu@@ tion@@ alise .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a sal@@ ute .
Ed@@ mund could not even sit down to his third age and still cannot speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the character that Ed@@ mund was for &quot; Please sing me something before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him character @-@ language at &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto CB@@ S News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character -- says it . Ed@@ mund has inv@@ ented a few signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses like mas@@ ks or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will influence the life of the counter with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I have been asked for a long time anymore after the progn@@ osis because I do not expect to tell me someone really .
&quot; but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants , which were caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus . &quot;
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

the we@@ ather@@ ing was se@@ al@@ able that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches in rain in this field .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas , on Friday a flo@@ ating system was used , while in the area Mobile continues to reg@@ ained . &quot;

the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Al@@ ek Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could be floo@@ ded many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a current st@@ aging floo@@ ds in Ascension par@@ ish represents a danger , since these over the be@@ aten rivers will only slowly be flowing in the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river ti@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , arrived on Friday already around 09.00 the highest stand that was ever recorded . &quot;

&quot; we are awake and the water flows and flow in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived there in the 48 years , in which they had never seen such a strongh@@ old of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities , and he would be the course to swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ fer could have saved all three in a great military truck , and had brought them to the next fire@@ house in Glo@@ be where they were able to find up to Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ds have quickly expanded , since there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities use the evac@@ uation instructions . &quot;

&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two du@@ tz@@ sch streets were closed on due to the flood @-@ water and sand@@ bags for the residents to take care of who hope to keep water from their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great floo@@ ds we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the Municip@@ al administration . &quot;

there were also three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical state ; the other two victims are according to CB@@ S Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was found on the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical state , reported the sender . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are determined to be found under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators .

it seems that it is clear that it is clearly tr@@ aded with a permanent struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the sal@@ aries , found themselves sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; so there were several armed fighters to have been involved , which were very active involved , &quot; shared police @-@ cor@@ ne@@ al Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia of the transmitter . &quot;
there were also several houses and cars made in the area .
it came to no feast and the police currently checks the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year girl was hit by a cross @-@ r@@ ack@@ et on the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police are still looking for a desp@@ air .
&quot; why we Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie need &quot;
this is what I introduce myself to me under the women &apos;s Olympic stadium and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have since 1984 at every summer ol@@ ymp@@ i@@ ade and the USA were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which is inspiring for many young girls from other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ ü@@ din and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin is , round , makes every proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has paved the black and h@@ isp@@ anic presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female gymn@@ asts as a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to be witness@@ ing the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they wa@@ ited un@@ expected , yet master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als Americ@@ an@@ erin , who won at an individual set @-@ time event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won the silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but so we do not see gym in the whole country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie swal@@ lowed all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it in the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will have only four tur@@ ers inside the team . moreover , it is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ n is a more expensive sport and gymn@@ ast primarily in private rooms that can be maintained by parents , which can be maintained by parents , which can be maintained , competition , competitive - and hotel rooms ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ers and families ) . the list can continue to continue . &quot;
the majority of these trainers are in a weal@@ thy prec@@ epts that can support the business .
in these associations they receive full training and this is for families a te@@ ures and long @-@ term commitment .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers from Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ er of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired the congreg@@ ations of countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a powerful and light @-@ accessible rotation . &quot;
I was founded my turn@@ table of 20 years ago .
&quot; for my events we have free Wi @-@ Fi and affordable Tur@@ n in Harlem for over 15.@@ 000 ur@@ b@@ ane young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) , and national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September we will be expanding to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality turbines , who make the opportunity to learn from this great ol@@ ymp@@ ic sport . &quot;
&quot; exercising is developing strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ ants for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for educational and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team to bring thousands of young girls to be interested in Tur@@ n and that is great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; &quot; by the Hol@@ en des ol@@ ymp@@ ic Mann@@ er@@ gol@@ ds and thanks , F@@ ass you motiv@@ ates so many young girls with different background to get their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
Assistant would like to organize other strikes after they have rejected the suggestion of Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to finish the dispute over changes by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37.@@ 000 assist@@ ants who took him in a vote , ref@@ uted him . &quot;
&quot; in July Hunt Hunt has un@@ vei@@ led the contract to introduce the contract , and said that N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any other delay for employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance should be given a new treaty , which contains changes to night and weekends work in order to improve the maintenance and weekend times . &quot;

efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to the solution of the disputes arising from talks to the government on re@@ funds will participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to that of a promise , the Jerem@@ y Hunt had made the last month in the last month , that his door would always reveal . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hunt must now act now to raise the penetration and concerns the assistance of the assistance .
&quot; if he did not do this , so it did not have the assistant made clear that they are ready to perform further labour measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike end of April saw a kick @-@ out of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine surgery and 100,000 appointments , since n@@ urses and practi@@ tioners were included in order to provide doctors on the stri@@ kers de@@ co@@ ders . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to finish the dispute over changes by adop@@ ting the reform of the British Medical Association .
BM@@ A wants to become a better week@@ day reminder to the 54.@@ 000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employee , called for the wiz@@ ard to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour measures , nothing of the only little , bel@@ asts already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing homes and their families only worries , hard@@ ships and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the past two months we have spoken of the trainees of the assistant , and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries , responded positively to concerns about the leadership and the wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ job . &quot;
&quot; employers hop@@ ed that continuing positive commitment on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training courses , training courses and the gender Ministry of Health with respect to agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

&quot; approximately 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack , and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
herds of cor@@ es and stroke are caused by ill@@ ings of fatty materials in the ar@@ ter@@ ies walls that make payments .

culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes it flour@@ ish in Muslim regions
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from the office last year due to corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led that widespread el@@ ect@@ ants in mus@@ cular congreg@@ ations are ignor@@ ant as an anni@@ hil@@ ation of government today revealed .
&quot; the former head of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es acc@@ esses the police , el@@ ectoral and Rath@@ geber to have ignored the evidence of el@@ ectoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tivity to ethnic never and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al government , which is now a ant@@ rup@@ tions of religious motives , said that the intim@@ i@@ dation of religious motives about religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off @-@ t@@ apes outside of the choices to intim@@ id@@ ated voters . &quot;
it recommends that voters should lead a reference to their identity in order to prove their identity .
at the moment a voters must only call his name and address .
&quot; the report suggests , not distant ink on the finger of a person to carry on when they give up their voting , to prevent someone twice choos@@ es . &quot;
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers should be more protection says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to communities and decisions from non @-@ official comm@@ on@@ ees or work@@ groups .
&quot; this not only serves against el@@ ectoral , but is also intended to protect the communist government in front of the broader corruption and financial institutions , which is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets V@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year decided to be a special El@@ ector , that the official Mayor of Lut@@ fur is called to a L@@ itan@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; that he could have brought his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; The campaign should be based on the basis that it is the im@@ itable duty of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either ques@@ tion@@ able , or the result of a post@@ ure , where one person is chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed in particular al@@ ar@@ ming of frau@@ dul@@ ent brief@@ ing - where the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to s@@ ells the el@@ ectoral system , including a leader to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; as proof has been put pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the el@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ ana background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions have such a conduct due to &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tivity to the eth@@ ni@@ cal and religion ignor@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to s@@ ells the system , including the ban , that political activ@@ ist wall@@ ets handle , to stop &quot; &quot; el@@ ers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May , demands also tough@@ er registration to prevent that the voting directory to mig@@ rations - and social bet@@ rot@@ ational purposes is used . &quot;
&quot; consider options , sel@@ ector before the choice according to your credit . &quot;
&quot; not removable ink on the finger of a person use , once they released their voice to prevent someone twice choos@@ es . &quot;
systematic ex@@ ams about the nationality of a person perform to ensure that they are either eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on request for an automatic brief@@ ing .
ban that political activ@@ ist full brief@@ ing elections and envel@@ opes of brief@@ sel@@ ections .
the police enter the authority ; shut @-@ off stations for el@@ ectoral stations .
&quot; a legislative change , which facilit@@ ates an indic@@ t@@ ment due to intim@@ i@@ dation according to the repres@@ sions of the People Act 1983 ( Fairs Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photography offered in el@@ ectoral stations .
request that only English can be used in the el@@ ectoral gy@@ ms ( except for Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees tend to prevail that voters do alone in the choices . &quot;
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &apos; amazing &apos; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets does not put any criminal off@@ ense .
&quot; the El@@ mb@@ al Court has explained Lut@@ fur for Rah@@ man and his representative for due to a L@@ itan@@ ism on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; said he . &quot;
&quot; he was guilty on a number of reasons for hin@@ ders , according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty . &quot;
he also cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the most effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; of the election districts of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning @-@ signal .
&quot; our country contributes to the mother of the parli@@ aments , a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying of el@@ ect@@ al and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; to honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all of the famous faces , the FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ ad , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ sites . &quot;

&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave it to hear that he has already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;

&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I get the probably as ac@@ compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur this year : the emerging simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Tr@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn for your rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; when one det@@ ects from behind from behind , then you should be able to see yourself as a list , so that you can see your att@@ acker and move out of the nut line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
gra@@ b the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bows to the face .
&quot; turn him out with the knee into the bar and twi@@ sting , while the att@@ ackers broke out before pain@@ s , the weapon out of his hands . strike it with the run into the face and move down , while they set the weapon upon him . &quot;
&quot; by att@@ ackers emerging from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the sheep , take the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they store the weight on the weapon and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon upon him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see precisely how it is mi@@ ra@@ chi advance .
&quot; but remember that it is at a rob@@ ber@@ y at the safest , your money is too rich - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;

&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right with doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of bow@@ el bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left , what it got stuck , more than a bad post@@ ure in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right has been known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by doing so through the world and had wonderful things as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public transportation to train stations up to dish@@ w@@ ps of toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told us : &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , saus@@ ages and fl@@ amm@@ ite water . &quot;
in the film he was definitely true to his reputation .
&quot; the only thing he h@@ eight@@ ened , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his pro@@ be@@ amed showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ies of more than 4000 units .
compared to that the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ min@@ ers is fresh or less than 60 .
&quot; but there was a Russian toil@@ ette , which he ref@@ unded to distr@@ acted after their l@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ies over 4000 units was , while fresh gr@@ aded hands will be one of less than 60 . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel line &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the bacterial number on different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; that comes the worst thing I have in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
I will see here nothing an@@ ew because it is here indo@@ ors .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company gave Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bow@@ el bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ date Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explained the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , that we end@@ owed that we said &quot; L@@ ass to call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intest@@ inal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer about more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala who introduced the director of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me - I would have loved my respect for Ian , when he had reli@@ ve some of things I have reli@@ ed him to l@@ le@@ ep , just like the ek@@ eli@@ able Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things when it was easier to bring Ian to bring it out and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty j@@ ures on film .
&quot; in one of the survey conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents of milk bacteria , especially with the wellbeing of stomach and intest@@ inal and 58 percent said that they contain at least occasionally products , the attached m@@ uni@@ forms of lac@@ tic bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ Social Family destro@@ ys against Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ach@@ s in Sal@@ t@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their first reward after a delic@@ acy with a damage to £ 5@@ 0,000 because they had its neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock have been thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Sal@@ t@@ ash Corn@@ wall .
&quot; after they were violent from their property , sho@@ cked the property &apos;s property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls of clever holes on , wooden di@@ ppers were opened , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were converted and it is believed that they are now living in private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy that works for the house of Corn@@ wall Housing in Corn@@ wall
she said : &quot; it was for the people here an absolute night@@ mare and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider since this property will probably be considered as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is in@@ famous and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had attached to the family , crossing with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ones , drug abuse , drugs and excessive scri@@ bes , streams and flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which under circumstances will be demol@@ ished , old gar@@ bage was found &quot;
&quot; they were tr@@ aded in the estate in which drugs have been tr@@ aded , the wooden pl@@ anks were opened . &quot;
they said they had to fight them on the streets and had to inv@@ oked the police on a regular basis
&quot; Corn@@ wall Housing and her partner violent this week by the property , after they gave them a prolon@@ ged period of 11 weeks to ex@@ clude voluntarily . &quot;
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ing were che@@ ated by light@@ ened neighbours that said that their lives has been made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; You were not worried about anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood on because it was here so quiet - this we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had administ@@ ered the family with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , which was called to the police in regular intervals , 20 years . &quot;
on the over@@ grown side of the coun@@ cill@@ or became tr@@ ash and old toys passed down
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that there is a pe@@ er to take any responsibility for their behavior and the family , as a Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ver always takes the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing into consideration . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour extremely was and their actions had to be trou@@ bled to their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the municipality , who have come to us and have made the information to have done . &quot;
I hope that this development will sp@@ ends a few neighbours and the message is con@@ veys that anti@@ social behavior will not be toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they all were over 20 . &quot;
a narrow mattress which is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after Del@@ o@@ gi@@ f on the ground
&quot; workers of the house@@ management are now to w@@ ile gar@@ bage , which surround the house . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 the police led a raid in the house by and found over 70@@ g cannabis and scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ ence and cash at the height of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
sk@@ elet@@ on received a sentence after she was guilty of the pos@@ sessions of a drug B in trade @-@ confidence .
&quot; they claimed that money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of their son Lee Skel@@ don was , who was in 2013 with a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it will have gone out that T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
lots of rooms of the house were acc@@ used with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they are ten@@ ant to do ten@@ ant who do not hold on the or@@ ship
Angela C@@ row is divided by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall with that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ver is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not hold of the or@@ anges .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can take themselves without self @-@ ordin@@ ations , as well as those who have been killed by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti@@ social behavior that continues to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

mA Long in a separate le@@ ague at table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympi@@ asi@@ eger .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defe@@ ated on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in an un@@ il@@ ateral finale of his comp@@ atri@@ ot and its &quot; titles &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.5 : 4 ) .
&quot; thus the world @-@ list of the world @-@ list First the &quot; Golden Grand Sl@@ am &quot; with success with World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the end@@ game and made the title among each other .
&quot; thus , it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese the single title would fetch the character of the Five Rings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese at the highest Olympia Tre@@ pp@@ ets was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
mA and Z@@ hang were left on the plate alone between sets and in time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches with them .
they had with@@ drawn on the ble@@ achers and left their prot@@ ectors in fair competition on each other .
&quot; the mat@@ ches up to here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , I had said Z@@ hang fol@@ ly . &quot;
after the Parti@@ al Gold @-@ and Silver medal with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expected .
mA had to really fight with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , certain he took the pace in the plate and left Z@@ hang down there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
through the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected match .
&quot; however , nevertheless , it was enough to see plenty of breath @-@ taking bub@@ ble change . &quot;
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had moved to his quarter @-@ finals against the German Europe @-@ champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , was afterwards in medical treatment , had to be &quot; ultimately &quot; with Ble@@ ch . &quot;

Donald Tru@@ mp Co@@ t ″ tremendous problems ″ available in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. rep@@ ublic@@ ans will be trou@@ bled by massive worries and also in the traditionally conservative federal states to put their majority in the traditionally conservative federal states .
&quot; presidential elections Donald Tru@@ mp now gave short@@ com@@ ings from its campaign campaign in the former rep@@ ublic@@ s strongh@@ old Utah . &quot;
&quot; a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ sp@@ y and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is something like concerns extern@@ ally , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after spending 16 Riv@@ als within the own rep@@ ublic@@ a camp , which has thrown out the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in Utah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ ilt , the false reports of his candi@@ da@@ cy , he took his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of Hoch@@ sch@@ les
Utah is usually a safe bank for rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; a survey from Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , according to Tru@@ mp and its ri@@ vals from the democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , like . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by far the distance that for rep@@ ublic@@ ans candidates are common in the federal state . &quot;
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia are applicable .
&quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C answered Tru@@ mp on the question , how he wants to stop the pre @-@ mar@@ sch cl@@ int@@ ons : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and if depos@@ ited : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he don &apos;t make anything else than the truth to tell .
&quot; if it is not possible for him at the end for the sake of political correctness , it is fine , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press stories , the Party of Tru@@ mp is expected to submit funds to support his election campaign , he should not present a better change values . &quot;
instead of how it wants the candidates of rep@@ ublic@@ ans for the congress more strongly among the arms .
Olympia : tri@@ ster fraud on doping test
the IO@@ C aims to set up an event in the event .
Ken@@ ias Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ eten is threatened after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a pro@@ fic@@ iency ass@@ ass@@ ination in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach to your home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee shared with the event as soon as possible an disciplines in the event to investigate the event .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan Func@@ tion@@ aire had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village a Ur@@ in @-@ sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ eller Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i released . &quot;
this was the Team@@ center Ken@@ ias have been reported by the doping control .
&quot; the World Association I@@ A@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C to provide information about the case to strict his own investigations , shared an I@@ A@@ AF spok@@ es@@ man . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures in the IO@@ C , the I@@ A@@ AF will make a review , called it in an I@@ A@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has taken to the doping control station and has issued himself as Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the sample released and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ ias Chef de Mission Stephan A@@ rap So@@ i . &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the Ath@@ l@@ ete who stood on the list for the training of the world @-@ anti @-@ mental agency .
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was 2015 in Beijing WM @-@ Fourth over 800 meters .
&quot; four days ago , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics Deleg@@ ation@@ sch@@ ef Michael Rot@@ i had been removed from the Rio games . &quot;
he is intended to have informed about money deposits in his country on their mental doping tests .
he was to report on his return at the airport of Nairobi in his return to Nairobi .
&quot; Kenya stands for the IO@@ C after a number of mental doping , already for some longer time under particular observation . &quot;
&quot; during the announcement of the IO@@ C presented more than 2000 mental target controls prior to the Rio games , un@@ used previously was pointed out that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into the visor . &quot;
&quot; the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency had previously exercis@@ ed a lot of pressure on the African country , to create an anti @-@ mental law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia @-@ Start .
&quot; in consequence , the W@@ ada Kenya took place from the list of countries , their mental fight con@@ form with the rules of the W@@ ada . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ ete of the country have won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reporting the ARD , ever again precau@@ tions were raised , in Kenya , resources are easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of the sport . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C Member Richard Po@@ und finally called for similar investigation in Kenya , as he had placed them in the Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot;
thereby it could be proven that in this sport @-@ surface finish and systematically Ged@@ opt has been proven .
Russia Al@@ ath@@ l@@ eten were excluded from the summer .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a Musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece . &quot;
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the Musical to the Temple of Classi@@ cal and filled with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
&quot; in the Orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ ian Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ te Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; warmer . &quot;
we always say that they are characterised by very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and mel@@ ody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older ge@@ al Mary .
she re@@ members with melan@@ chol@@ y to her beloved with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because they are musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there is Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , which I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist .
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enormous man .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli gives the Compliments back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
it is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , which is at all very important ! &quot;
for the American director Philip WM . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; High @-@ up : &quot; in this piece it is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have gone the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ or@@ ik@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; these are the same subjects , and they are just as extinct as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London ma@@ ids , who joined the IS in Syria , was killed in Syria . &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ ma@@ ids , who left London last year to join the IS , he died in Syria . &quot;
the lawyer Tas@@ n@@ ime A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family learned a few weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was thought that they killed by a Russian a@@ erial grip in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the strongh@@ old of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; S@@ ULT@@ ANA was 17 years old and died shortly after her family after she had gone , to leave the war of war , and to return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good in it is - as a reminder and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with it , to go into a war region - people ever meet this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school@@ ma@@ ids from the east of London went to a plane in Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sult@@ ana &apos;s family has been informed that they married a IS@@ IS comb@@ at@@ ants in Syria - and within a few months to the wi@@ do@@ w .

the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition . &quot;
the br@@ anded as the Gü@@ len @-@ trailer are cr@@ ates lec@@ tur@@ ers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .

&quot; as the newspaper reported by vocation by calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks put the Turks already in front of the cou@@ p the greatest group of because of political persecution recognized asylum in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on 30 June , this 11.@@ 386 people will be entitled to nearly 29 per cent of all known as the Soviet Union ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , do not refer to war , poverty or a perspective of wick@@ edness . &quot;
&quot; asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , so by state side , individual persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern :
&quot; strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing of summer @-@ election , with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia must not choose the land@@ day . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; 2021 will not be held once again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for blocks as far as far , it is not : summer holidays , heat and landscap@@ ed competition - this . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the el@@ ih@@ ood are on vacation .
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not native , so they are not allowed to choose the land@@ day . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters asc@@ ents , bal@@ loons , fl@@ asks , fl@@ yers , and at the end of a count , only l@@ ant@@ agon@@ izing . &quot;
&quot; until 4th of September 2016 , the el@@ ectoral and final Fer@@ i@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to come to a vote for almost at the people of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , An@@ leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 is the strongest party , now lies in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
thr@@ illing is how strong new@@ com@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ism .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Res@@ sch@@ ef , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous el@@ ectoral campaign , one sees from his big pl@@ ak@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; he travels through land , distributed ro@@ ses and pl@@ ears a little with the people , just as it did even his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , soul will get cold feet and is ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel &apos;s gu@@ ilt on the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refuge@@ e policy , &quot; We create &quot; &quot; We have acceler@@ ated the rise of justi@@ fication , which will probably be the beautiful office now . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its Spit@@ s@@ andi@@ c data , the Minister Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced as it is when you start the wrong time at the right place of the campaign . &quot;
she has invited twice a German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s German Bundestag is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as an Mecklenburg @-@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other Länder , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U is largely based on the usual options on market locations and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and bal@@ loons . &quot;
&quot; that is , so co@@ ert , play only a &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noticed that her on the land has the basis away the basis , that they must be very strict , once again a wire to people . &quot;
&quot; you are here like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , the Gre@@ ens : in the times of the country barely there . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U el@@ ectoral campaigns to his Mit@@ stre@@ ite is also self @-@ ent@@ lar@@ v@@ end : &quot; you must go there , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering his SPD has now called for a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still won the SPD 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the green , small part@@ ei with seven percent in the surveys , are likely to create the leap into the day . &quot;
they are made out of the holidays @-@ need a modern virtu@@ e and create their constitu@@ ents from the internet .
&quot; online campaigns &quot; , &quot; it is called the provincial Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green el@@ ectoral campaigns to sp@@ ur@@ am search for local stim@@ uli among the holidays . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the Spit@@ s@@ andi@@ da@@ tin , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house boot through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ se lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Re@@ furb@@ ishment : guest house suffer from the blo@@ cking
&quot; at the speed , with which the B 27 is soft , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 20 am , there is all @-@ mis@@ leading praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything quite z@@ acked , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet @-@ gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be rec@@ alled on the weekend before the half @-@ time proceeding according to the south until the end of October is expected to be finished .
&quot; praise is also pra@@ ised for the buil@@ ders of those responsible for the construction work , about when it comes to the establishment of per@@ im@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , it is and also the blo@@ cking of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is back , the traffic situation inside the place is relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now cycle from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
spreading traffic through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there were partly serious complaints , &quot; says that for the wrong management of the Re@@ furb@@ ishment of responsibility of responsibility Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residen@@ ces of Bach@@ d@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner @-@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many shadows were sought and rather their Nav@@ i familiar than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what did that lead to man@@ di@@ vers in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limit@@ ers were not observed , the community ur@@ ged the measuring system from m@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable abundance , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself on site about the location . &quot;
two to three per minute are heated .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 times kilometers at the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site , it has become more calm . &quot;
for busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg are now open the road again .
busin@@ ess@@ men do not look for busin@@ ess@@ men .
&quot; however , that the B 27 @-@ development has led to them to sales in sales , everyone who asks you . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; so for other companies , for which has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most light decline , &quot; but also a that of course &quot; the lear@@ ns is missing . &quot;
most are the most exploited are the locations along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öhn@@ er , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
it lack@@ ed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; the sales revenue is available at &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road@@ sters have thrown its operation &quot; at two years . &quot;
half of his associates have to release .
&quot; if I have had a company with 4000 employees , and half would have been dism@@ is@@ sed , the policy would have been a different way . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has been on a request by G@@ öhn@@ er whether we responded to a financial compensation , otherwise , with the advantages of the situation at the B 27th now , they also possess the dis@@ advantages caused by the restoration . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öhn@@ er knows from other land , where so much has been handled . &quot;
&quot; in all Kl@@ agen , G@@ öhn@@ er is sure that his guest will continue to continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family run has been located since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars can now be pre@@ viewed because of the complex traffic light less frequently , it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you do not go , it is also quite different . &quot;
&quot; that his stem cells after the end of the refurb@@ ishment work once again , G@@ öhn@@ er has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ öhn@@ er stops the impact of the B 27 building work on its clients for the greatest crisis which has experienced his hospitality in its many years of history . &quot;
six months of construction work that is already brut@@ al .
constantly in the name of the terrorist counter @-@ fighting laws .
&quot; following the recent attacks , the Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick@@ er security package . &quot;
but what has an D@@ ul@@ ary status with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable , &quot; said the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new safety sp@@ ak@@ ets . &quot;
you are overwhel@@ m@@ ous nobody .
&quot; other , additional points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
also because I am looking for myself .
&quot; but as an internal Minister he was on the results , and at a &quot; reco@@ ver@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , has sent a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but they fall into the wider range .
&quot; some is already known , announced , pro@@ filed : that a new security authority should take care of the b@@ aking @-@ key communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , the fact that Germany has to put several EU guidelines on air passengers and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère did not start a second shot for suggestions who did not have to make up with the SPD so far : he wants to face sympath@@ iz@@ ers for terr@@ ors with punishment , and ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with double citizenship in the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; sp@@ ends the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , it is nevertheless reasonable for reasonable and demands nothing , which did not have any chances when the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner are anyway no chances . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
these are partly in itself : he is planning a quick method for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people in front of deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees who are fet@@ ched into the country previously , should allow their smartphone to check their smartphone and reveal social media accounts for security check . &quot;
&quot; in D@@ ul@@ ings for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to pose some worse than so far - about such that causes off@@ ences or their papers are deliber@@ ately conscious to wear their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legally holy .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of memorial for example - raises the question : what does that actually have to do with certainty and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be in speech that the attacks were made by Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , many people in the face of the high refuge@@ e are concerned about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that the people have been deep@@ ened , even in the times of el@@ ectoral times did not come out . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the hits in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ locking is great .
&quot; and yes , there are el@@ ectoral campaigns . &quot;
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly important in the issue of internal security .
in the last few days we went up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ sti@@ ger argument about the equipment of the federal police , then via a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Inter@@ ior , where the Res@@ ellers also ask a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also here to reconc@@ iled notes .
from a return from the double @-@ pass he stop nothing .
we have had the discussion in Germany with temporary .
they re@@ make sense is not useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional to all corners and whether it is indeed &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , it has to show itself yet . &quot;
there is a lot in what kind of war might be concerned .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to establish itself in the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only times careful talk to talk and said , &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to the safety further . &quot;
still Volkswagen gli@@ ding by .
despite diesel sk@@ and@@ als the delivery figures rise worldwide .
&quot; however , not in all markets it runs round . &quot;
in the recall campaign there is vor@@ tex to create a term .
Volkswagen starts with the ex@@ agger@@ ations in the second half of the year .
&quot; in the past year , Europe &apos;s biggest high@@ ways in the previous year , despite the diesel aff@@ ection@@ able thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets further a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July weak@@ ened the nuclear stamp VW mainly in Western Europe , and thus res@@ trained the overall sale , such as that was noted in D@@ ax companies . &quot;
worldwide selling brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , the sales grew 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ten the ship@@ ments around almost a hex@@ ag@@ ab .
&quot; Andreas St@@ ack@@ mann , Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ening numbers from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it has given a sales market in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the cou@@ p@@ ile endeav@@ or in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ toman has also been approved by the EU , explained a spok@@ es@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the car@@ bure@@ tor first escal@@ ated first , is also further a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected @-@ party sm@@ arter of the Nieder@@ sachsen continues to be gli@@ ding by the diesel sk@@ an@@ dal : after the first seven months , only a supply chain of 0,@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles is to be@@ ech . &quot;
consolidated Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales office from January to July .
&quot; 1,@@ 3 percent more vehicles provided Volkswagen in this time , 5.@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software subscription .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW offers 2.5 million cars for conversion into workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of conversion , VW , that the transformation of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion of vehicles there will be no deterioration of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ aches present the customer after the conversion to a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the company . &quot;
reason are legal enemies .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reports , Volkswagen grant his German customers now a guarantee of re@@ per@@ ed diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed these last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Education .
the ministry &apos;s ministry was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry Commission and of the KBA at the full extent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) according to the Ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine performance after the conversion to no deter@@ ior@@ ations take place and all typ@@ ing relevant vehicle values unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not how it was in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; Volkswagen has the possibility that customers for example a half a year after the conversion to a workshop in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is nothing to do with any other damage , which at all comes with regard to possible guarantees , as it was called . &quot;
this is why I use VW the term &quot; Guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from weal@@ thy austerity - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is just about 139 customers , which is 40 million euros to be found on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher Banks speaks of a single case , and sees this not a signal : normal as@@ parag@@ us would have to fear , for their as@@ parag@@ us criminal prosec@@ ution . &quot;
&quot; Lag@@ ers banks money on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ c@@ ins . &quot;
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily cas@@ c@@ ture .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs up to 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; it has been 40 million euros for a long time , which could be lifted from one day to the other , and which he cannot be distr@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; said the chef . &quot;
&quot; I can not lie for every million 4000 euros . &quot;
the costs he will continue according to the course of the course .
&quot; the cash just lie in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced all four inci@@ dents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
most people would have an understanding and changes in different approaches .
only few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern explained : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is caused by all the banks . &quot;
&quot; they alone carry alone , be &quot; &quot; economically permanently not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for accounts , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
with criminal case for deposits from three million Euros had made the Thuringia Regional and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger country with its skat@@ bank branch 2014 head@@ lines .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , captain of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect that private clients have to pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff , which is equipped by the assets of something lush . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank as it is free of charge . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 , founded in 1911 , has two @-@ cast branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
in the region well known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the gen@@ ossen@@ verband Bavaria &quot; are currently no further banks known that calcul@@ ating a compensation for deposits of private clients , &quot; &quot; spok@@ es@@ man . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Federation of German National banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had ended at the end of June : &quot; the thres@@ hold , into the neg@@ atives , is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competitors .
the customers in Germany will not have fallen in the width .
destination plates : who is buying actually sound @-@ plates ?
lonely men medium age love plates .
&quot; before you assign the comm@@ ent@@ een parts to over@@ lay it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ in@@ alien@@ ation of men with r@@ ust ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multi@@ purpose of rep@@ ent@@ ance is not to be found on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to welcome the novel@@ ties of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life @-@ no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ ks according to the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most prob@@ able chains . &quot;
&quot; there is also no hormone by hob@@ by@@ ists , it has an emotional meaning : older plat@@ ter reserve their feelings more likely to spend ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) . &quot;
but will the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy street in Soho , a hum@@ ble ascent and wild gr@@ ading , my hands keep and a bit cri@@ ti@@ ly say as : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let us take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ hos slowly goes to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller were arranged - there are still a handful of fantastic tables . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman , shut the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and vegetables by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages , a woman , pres@@ um@@ ably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector that I ask ?
&quot; I already cher@@ ish , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; I have approx . 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these sound plates , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by his home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford to buy them when they were previously released , when he was young and bank@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; many things that I buy are from the late 60@@ s , early 70@@ ies , which appeared , when I had 11 or 12 . things , when I was probably something to buy them , to buy them , &quot; &quot; says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who purchase plates , more intro@@ ver@@ ted and eager to spend their time , and adds : &quot; I do not smoke and I drink not very much . &quot;
this is my ver@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers who meets You@@ go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard of the Medi@@ enh@@ pe people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and let yourself be seen again to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; by the conversations that I have led , people usually have chosen about 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom to a trailer of a certain age .
but what about the inn@@ ate emotional meaning of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a business like ph@@ onica , in order to recognize that record stores a so@@ othing community of par@@ ges@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to draw back to the stability of familiar sound @-@ platform from objects that weak it@@ enti@@ ces .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the pos@@ al pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to employ spirit@@ ually .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; a staff of a record @-@ stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought this month a record , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey took also out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , during 7 % of those who buy a record , no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the report , I would probably look very worried while I was shining through a st@@ acks of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men of middle ages ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone recently came here purely and said , &quot; I do not say a record player , but I would like to buy a radio record record so that I can put them into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; producing more products , less musi@@ kl@@ as@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older that are only slowly pure . &quot;
&quot; stop , that has dedicated to the mu@@ ff almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I reproduce . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women aged middle aged . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat more relaxed than in the above @-@ standing shops - Wild Be@@ ads neu@@ ester Syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ t@@ ted pop instead of experimental jazz , from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them sees mo@@ ur@@ ky , but brand mental trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to imagine if you are long next to someone over 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variation of the plates available for sale . &quot;
it is rather a man@@ nequ@@ ins as a large shopping cart .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore , the collector of records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from one computer or in another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives along with a de@@ gr@@ ated sig@@ h . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , from which is said that a new generation of record owners is to have inspired : urban out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the on@@ shine , the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants to patterns , could be group@@ ed by a group of young teen@@ ager before a father and his daughter to remember , a cro@@ sl@@ ey turn@@ table to buy . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , J@@ eff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees her - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; turn@@ art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my post @-@ ups take , that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , let them , at least in record business in Soho , the great number of female collector &apos;s and record lovers that exist in reality , record business and in On@@ line@@ for@@ es , un@@ considered . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty with security out of record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and leaves through plates , while they die the star@@ ring of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who domin@@ ates the shoulders of middle ages . &quot;

French court bor@@ row@@ ed offering over dem@@ oli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refuge@@ e camp
&quot; a French tribun@@ al has rejected a quot@@ ation of authorities in Calais , do@@ z@@ ens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais . living in the thousands of refugees who live in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; in a court proceedings this week argu@@ ing the authorities in Calais that the state should be rus@@ hed to sell 72 pro@@ visional transactions , sell , hair@@ dressing services , sell , hair@@ dressing services , or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Calais should be argu@@ ed that these places should be con@@ dense , from which no taxes would be paid out of which no taxes would be paid and that of a fire@@ wood and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important when the free meals are offered by state @-@ supported Association and other groups , not enough food for the growing figures in the camp . &quot;
they also led out that the pro@@ visional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the instruction of people who operate 72 pro@@ visional shops , but the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Calais . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just people live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation , the young Book Kids &apos;s café of the camp that is operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a advice on Asyl@@ um for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany R@@ aser must be set up on the next generation of speed units : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested especially effective . &quot;
the fut@@ uris@@ tic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic made from Wiesbaden can be used for example at un@@ fail@@ ing points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
&quot; for example , on highway construction or to gentle bridges , with temporary Tem@@ por@@ ters , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary bl@@ ender for adher@@ ence to speed limit@@ ing . &quot;
a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery stops at un@@ interrupted measurement operation five days , the case data will be transmitted via a modem . &quot;
laser measurement technology can also be recorded via several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit@@ ers as well as pass @-@ directions by time , stri@@ ps and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;

United Kingdom out@@ dated silver in 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the finale on Thursday evening to a corrupt stop in the last hur@@ dle , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ adly stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji acqu@@ itted a master class in handling , Side @-@ stepp@@ ing , back @-@ back , line @-@ run and ro@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ad of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was reconc@@ iled through the not too bad tro@@ phy of the Silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the B@@ ok@@ s , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but independently of it , Fi@@ ji could have be@@ aten in this form a 15 @-@ man team . &quot;
it could be for GB a con@@ sol@@ ation - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal at his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Ch@@ ef@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former Chief for England from Wim@@ bl@@ edon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost at Ryan every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; here , they lost only one . &quot;
&quot; this fl@@ ap is going to do , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began mar@@ vel@@ ous and led the attacks of GB@@ s from fun cr@@ ying .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co . , as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with even four minutes running time , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another attack from the right corner , he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball points .
&quot; a rag@@ ed T@@ ackle of Mitchell stops the mountain from man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute l@@ ete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch down and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa was added to a new beginning since the revival and there were still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
&quot; V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ently by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ ms up to the line to make a gate . &quot;
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the rest .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the UK still had to be depres@@ sed . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time through and closed the fi@@ ji@@ bian gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was going to a brilliant stop@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favour of South Afri@@ cans , whose fans s@@ ects , flags , and d@@ anced on the ble@@ achers . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the fi@@ ff @-@ Gre@@ enland , the Fi@@ j@@ is h@@ ugs and GB k@@ ick@@ ed cr@@ ying into the lawn . &quot;
early in the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defe@@ ated Japan in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain over South Africa in an early half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the B@@ ok@@ s in the first half of the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton coll@@ ap@@ sed the line with an impressive kick @-@ work and achieved a gate under the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant sp@@ ective Tac@@ es by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , super@@ vised the profit - and thus the Silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with cancer of the Train@@ ers to rowing
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ ous gold than these games and that wants what hot .
&quot; from the first ru@@ d@@ ope to the last , 220 harsh H@@ ieve , who enter into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment on Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if it was only the appl@@ ause , there were three voices in the boat , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was present to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without tax @-@ woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports , which laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 39.@@ un@@ ted use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ l@@ ements that refl@@ ecting on the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflected the type of the trick . &quot;
&quot; behind any gold in the ruin , a batt@@ al@@ ion is contributing to willi@@ am Hel@@ pers which make the difference and it was nobody to be more humane than the coach , who would not survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did her . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a fairly sh@@ lim@@ me situation .
it changes a bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could start what the break down to a minimum in case that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; the Ru@@ ins is already a challenge , but that makes it a even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ medi@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a nerve rac@@ ted morning with this spent something more than anything else and tried to handle his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a commitment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated what a lot of me that means how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have a better person for training or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were unable to keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 metres , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark were fin@@ alized , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; lead in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
&quot; it is really important , not to let themselves t@@ ear . &quot;
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something t@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; today we wanted no fire@@ work , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for one year before making decisions about its future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adventure of your Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that could have had a lot of pressure .
&quot; in London , it took some six months to concei@@ ve that I am a Olymp@@ ics . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better at , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years old ex@@ empl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the Aqu@@ arian association &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ad@@ group &quot; , &quot; R@@ ada@@ t G@@ öl@@ ler , goes to retirement . &quot;
the association is considered &quot; bay@@ ern@@ widely ex@@ empl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fresh water @-@ purpose association as a role model for large water producers .
it was that of some time in the original tone it was in an article by Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later the water forum of the government of sub @-@ fran@@ ken was announced .
the work of the v@@ eit@@ ing group &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as ex@@ empl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all the stands , Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband &apos;s staff , 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
he was re@@ tired at the age of 65 in the age of 65 .
&quot; drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ ing group based in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 locations and hamlet with about 5500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member community are the congreg@@ ations of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Limassol . &quot;
for further towns and municipalities there are water supply agreements .
&quot; the current chair , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Citiz@@ ens in Ger@@ tru@@ d B@@ ühl ( F@@ W ) , re@@ minded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was appointed as Aqu@@ arius and already appointed to the managing director of the T@@ eck@@ Association . &quot;
&quot; his tasks are very varied and they extend from the water @-@ conduc@@ tivity and maintenance activities , the budget systems , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency calls on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land @-@ purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the restoration of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the re@@ mun@@ eration of water lines . &quot;
&quot; there have been no bre@@ ast@@ feeding , and I have always recorded new developments , because water life be@@ ute and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation , she pra@@ ised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he has worked with much heart of heart for its water @-@ purpose and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago he was able to present a success for the success of the v@@ eit@@ ing group for the nit@@ r@@ age group in front of the water forum of the district sub@@ fran@@ ken .
he received a lot of recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler has been pra@@ ised by Alf@@ ons Alf@@ ons g@@ rie@@ bel who worked for 28 years with him .
he is the best water@@ fan and he was a tre@@ ad boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlights from his point of view , he spoke to the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ structure of the constra@@ int . &quot;
but the greatest challenge and the most difficult use were but the pi@@ pel@@ av@@ al in the flood near Kirch@@ l@@ ter on a 3rd of January .
&quot; here we had to work through minus 17 degrees all night , so that the localities with water could be looked after . &quot;
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one once can only maintain , because one filled the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from lau@@ re@@ es who enters the succ@@ ession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago , and turns to others involved parents : &quot; you have to have the courage to speak about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Corriere della Sera . &quot;
&quot; when the disease had been recognized with their son , I believed , they die . &quot;

&quot; the man himself inv@@ oked at us and stated to have his spirits , &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators be on the flight , after him I will be public . &quot;

&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters large , mus@@ cular , brown , brown and has a gl@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police have published a picture of him . &quot;
it is however a few years old .
in the meantime the man carries a gl@@ at@@ ze .

the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim is the year 1988 , the perpet@@ rators 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make no information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but it confirmed that a man was killed . &quot;

steel - Light@@ sight for German steel industry
the kr@@ isen@@ ge@@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millimeters .
&quot; financial stres@@ ses , which threatened by the industry from the green electricity promotion , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it lead to the exemp@@ tion of the Renewable Energy outlines to the so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ day@@ . ) &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations for two years ahead .
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel producer , the gases coming from the testi@@ cles to generating power generation for their own consumption . &quot;
the steel industry &apos;s steel industry follows additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z I now give a foundation certificate with the European Commission after talks with competitive kom@@ miss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only if the generators will be replaced in the steel structures , in case of an E@@ EG conversion from 20 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot;
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ consumption .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the former regulation is largely written . &quot;
special importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; steel &quot; &quot; is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of emissions legal , climate and employment targets are &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel construction industry suffered from over since the financial crisis in 2008 and a significant price .
&quot; in the last year , the situation continues to expand as the world &apos;s largest decre@@ e China in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand of mass steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel @-@ concerts .
in the course of this year the situation has a little relaxed .
&quot; for one of the em@@ bos@@ sed incis@@ ors on impor@@ ter effect , for others the economic prospects of China have raised up in China . &quot;
&quot; clear , how lasting the price relaxing . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp was careful on Thursday .
&quot; most recently , the prices would have been more stagn@@ ated . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with more cost reduction .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp wanted not to ex@@ clude the works of individual works finally .
&quot; in the German steel industry , the end of 2015 has been around 86@@ ,000 people . &quot;
in July the German steel producer despite rising prices and increasing orders are cau@@ tious .
they re@@ produced with 3.4 million tonnes good six percent lower raw materials than in the previous year @-@ year @-@ round as the economic union of steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May the quantity delivered now returned to the second month of booking .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is increased by two percent below the previous year . &quot;
the association expects to increase the results in the coming months thanks to an improved performance of order .
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does Sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as young girls she was in the school choir , in the teacher , and now she sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; describes them . &quot;
&quot; after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says . &quot;
&quot; next door , they do something good with their health and mind . &quot;
&quot; for singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hac@@ kler of the German Senate . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , he describes Hac@@ kler . &quot;
through the regular assem@@ bling can make sen@@ i@@ ding social contacts and maintain .
&quot; for frequently , social and family structures at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp made in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the others and to learn to others - a choir is a very special form of meeting . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense mean Hac@@ kler .
because practic@@ ing a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever calls on a regular basis in everyday life as well as in everyday life is not so fast from the pu@@ ties .
&quot; even if it is about to get the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal community of senior organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure , explains them . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that singing , or hearing of songs in elderly people awak@@ ens many memories , often linked with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
by Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and particularly mel@@ o@@ dies themselves sl@@ ed himself dem@@ ining people with long rep@@ uted events .
&quot; while singing , the head is also required to ask a special performance . &quot;
focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cog@@ nitive challenge .
&quot; especially older people , who alone live alone , do not only concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition , which one drives through the singing in the choir , means Hac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem is growing by the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show themselves : if I love for something long , I will get better and alert over myself - this experience rein@@ forces . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with the singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , betra@@ ying L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; it does not sing@@ ly alone - with 50 sin@@ ful men , who sounds already there when a sound is next to it ? &quot;
looking for the suitable offer seniors various possibilities , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sing someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , you can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer insights about the choirs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn directly to the municipality or the Church . &quot;
many senior choirs can be found via the Internet .
&quot; who does not have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the Internet right . &quot;
&quot; who desire to sing should necessarily join a choir , pu@@ zz@@ t Hac@@ kler . &quot;
sing the soul is good and has a bit of fre@@ y - this applies to all ages .
Cats react sensitive as a cr@@ ater to Schre@@ ie of the young animals
Bi@@ ologists did in Hannover to examine what effect the Ru@@ oves of Katz@@ en@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the males did not let the males do not even cold , but they remained in the difference to the females always alike . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al of Katz@@ en@@ bab@@ ys on Mi@@ bes of the Small .
they respond to ten percent faster to lu@@ te of k@@ ittens who have found themselves in great distress such as scientists found out of the veterinary university and Medical University Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
ch@@ ater also react to the ruins of k@@ ittens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the acou@@ sti@@ cal differences between the Mi@@ che of less and heavily reg@@ ained p@@ ups for the males either not perceived or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
it is first author@@ ise in the study that was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ tionary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ ittens has distingu@@ ishes with the ur@@ gency of its assistance . &quot;
&quot; observed , a total of nine adult female and eight cranes from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; you have been played for a herd of little ones , which were taken for three minutes from the litter box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; for others they were faced with scre@@ ams of stronger k@@ ittens , which have been raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample rehear@@ sal for failure .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own off@@ spring , re@@ acted differenti@@ ated to the Schre@@ ie , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
you turned out more quickly to the speaker when this ro@@ fe has played a very rainy k@@ ittens .
this ability may possibly be cultivated or developing with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded to all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined many times in humans the reactions of women and men on baby . &quot;
&quot; also some studies showed that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski acc@@ esses with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the entered football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r has been installed .
he acc@@ used to be a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the cou@@ p@@ ile , Turkey will take place again an important football game in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; in front of the du@@ el of Arch@@ ri@@ al between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ph@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; &quot; Business as &quot; &quot; is said . &quot;
&quot; even in the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the condition of the exp@@ ul@@ atory after the overthrow in July , the government , the everyday life of standardization would not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are di@@ gest , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the cou@@ plings . &quot;
it is not yet made in front of the football .
against the previous Star@@ k@@ ick@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r set the Prosec@@ ut@@ or a ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
&quot; therefore , by the meantime in America living in America will be disc@@ ar@@ ded , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ kis@@ r is to be tr@@ ailers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the cou@@ p Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the cou@@ p .
&quot; this applies first to 90 days of final condition even until October , in fact that has actually affect the lives of most Turks , but as good as no effects . &quot;
the next &apos; democracy &apos; w@@ aking &apos; in public places throughout the country Erd@@ og@@ an declared an end on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - split in tr@@ ailers and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the working club B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not counted among the friends of the President .
&quot; but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks , but in view of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart is defe@@ ats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; will be able to arrive especially again on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
his spor@@ ty value presented the Köl@@ ner in the derived season under proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first game time as Top@@ scor@@ er of his organisation .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ her@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ winner .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ er him : &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy of his team .
&quot; thanks &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; found the dis@@ appoint@@ ing season for the record champion an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion .
&quot; after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; is distinguished also in the Europa League early . &quot;
in the south by Li@@ g it was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to gain something .
&quot; we have managed and this is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as ran the game year better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who took place with 26 seasons , as an Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sch@@ ütz@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig , the basis for the 14th tracks . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in doing so , the E@@ AC Florence had been known under the contract and sent to B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as only out bor@@ row@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the cou@@ p@@ ile , because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario doesn &apos;t want to come to us , he must only say it &quot; &quot; zi@@ pped the journal &quot; &quot; K@@ ick@@ er &quot; &quot; Club@@ chief F@@ ic@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the stor@@ ms would have to be ready to ren@@ oun@@ ce around a third of his to 7.5 million euros . &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary at Florence , we can not pay . &quot;
&quot; despite doping , these athletes have even medals @-@ chances at Olympia in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin has been locked twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led Ath@@ le@@ tics @-@ sinn@@ ers can only lau@@ gh - they fight in Rio to medals .
the topic is determined by the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had su@@ ed her starting right shortly before playing in her start ( 100 meters chest ) of mer@@ c@@ age and f@@ ted . &quot;
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scen@@ eries : with a opened smile she was still proud in the hall and had prov@@ oked with her appearance .
&quot; to be stuck , that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a J@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are still numerous other sports@@ men , who are going to start in spite of the weather during the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ olds is one of the most contro@@ versi@@ al figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked for two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest trial of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ aica ) : the two @-@ fold Olympi@@ ad and si@@ eben@@ fold World Championship in 2010 had to sit a six @-@ month lock after having been proven the intake of the pain @-@ by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
they have had strong to@@ he@@ ada@@ che after an operation it defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was tested the Olymp@@ ics of 2012 and Europe @-@ Championships from 2010 to 2016 positive on the ban stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ ko@@ vic bes@@ po@@ ort the wis@@ ely intake and was locked six months .
the four wid@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the large gold@@ sm@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olymp@@ ics and two @-@ star World Champion over 400 m , was tested in 2010 positive and 21 months . &quot;
a means for penis enlargement is responsible for praying Mer@@ ritt .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any ath@@ l@@ ete were detected so many medals . &quot;
&quot; so , T@@ ich@@ on his F@@ WC title released from 2005 nine years later , after having been established with him testosterone . &quot;
the meantime 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to have had Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid no@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ Tit@@ le in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the bronze medals of the Olympic Games in 2008 was brought back to the Olympic Games of the Olympic Games in 2008 , as well as of its original rank of the International Criminal Tribunal . &quot;
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is located in the rank two of the world list . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km G@@ ull , China ) : the world record and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested in May in May , but may nevertheless start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 years old World Championship , references to the intake of a bot@@ an@@ ed supplement found , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
Bom@@ ben@@ chs in Thailand - Hon@@ ol@@ ates wo@@ unded - Sever@@ al T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spok@@ es@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ early . &quot;
&quot; they suffered mou@@ ld@@ ings , and be treated in hospital , but have already been able to leave this again . &quot;
her home trip was planned for early September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holidays island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ GA , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ esi@@ on are also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department , in this respect , in stand @-@ like contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok Hua H@@ in , there were first explo@@ ded two bom@@ bs at a day @-@ day evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police were killed a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in and about 20 people viol@@ ated , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Fri@@ day@@ early again entered again two spr@@ ing@@ ements , while the authorities was killed another man . &quot;
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the morning a bom@@ bs .
near the det@@ on@@ ation near the holidays popular Bad@@ estr@@ ands Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red by police documents a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the southeast coast of the country , then a further bom@@ b who killed a city &apos;s city . &quot;
the spr@@ int was according to the authorities in a flower set before the territory of the coastal police in the air .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ GA and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ ek@@ on on the southeast coast several Ver@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; you go from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ent@@ ate bear the same manual , &quot; said armies Dan@@ ai von meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it may be too early to express themselves to possible motives - probably , however , it is about the deeds of Muslim reb@@ els . &quot;
the Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern which is typical for the bom@@ b attacks Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; in contrast , the Thai police declared , the attacks cannot be linked to the Islam@@ ist movement , or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is just local sab@@ ot@@ age , which is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
it is rather the fact that the bom@@ bs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have received secrecy of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however they don &apos;t have been informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; not yet , what Group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police dism@@ is@@ sed its officials in the whole country , security around major government buildings as well as airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ usement district . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b attacks , but they mostly do not cause tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hua H@@ in , there is a palace that was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King of hum@@ i@@ bol ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; according to the latest bom@@ bing depression , the Austrian State Department recommends to provide the Austrian State Department on his homepage , to provide the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high level of safety ( safety stage 3 ) made for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ad@@ and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risks ( safety stage 2 ) for the rest of the country .
&quot; the attacks on Thursday and Friday , a few days after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum held over one by the military jun@@ ta . &quot;
this sp@@ ans the military influence also in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta @-@ Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the Bom@@ bs were an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ens chaos , while the country towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had taken power after a phase of blo@@ ody un@@ rest , holds itself a good , the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not been able to get a handle for years in the extreme south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago there were also killed in Bangkok for an attack on a popular Hind@@ u Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ oming attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity &quot; identity &quot; is in the visor of the Federal Minister for Constitu@@ tional protection .
&quot; according to several juris@@ dic@@ tions , the Constitu@@ tional authorities in the covenant have put the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; identity &apos; appe@@ als for aspir@@ ations against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; said Constitu@@ ent Head of Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the emig@@ rants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in the extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that is why we observe the motion now too .
&quot; the &quot; identity Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass @-@ emig@@ ration &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity by overcoming . &quot;
&quot; environ@@ ment@@ alists in nine Länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; identity . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority have worked closely with the state offices . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity motion &apos; try to pick up their target group since it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitu@@ ent chief . &quot;
&quot; generally , trying to address them with juven@@ ile language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ists are as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ ties . &quot;
this is not an adequate advertising for your own cause .
the propaganda should be emotion@@ ally emotional .
young people are there in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last from several federal states had given reports of contacts of &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the Constitu@@ tional protection , possible contacts of this species is relevant only from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist are changing , its target device is changing and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so it is whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase of legal otives and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refuge@@ e camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have noticed that there can be legal war structures in recent years .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Irish Group .
&quot; it can be quite sure that further legal group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refuge@@ e creatures or attacks from other right @-@ extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
but a wide @-@ wide @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of leg@@ ster@@ ror@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the former groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate also expressed that many transi@@ tions on the account of men went that previously did not come into account in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the in@@ di@@ gest at attacks on Asyl@@ um may not be known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated criminal prosec@@ ut@@ or or p@@ endant in the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences which previously stayed with right extre@@ mi@@ ties , which might have been politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left were elected , however , by far @-@ extrem@@ ist tuning . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ ad or Wel@@ coming kor@@ de the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bra@@ ve appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer days in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight swimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he was unable to see more in the TV images . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the exhaust was selected .
in social networks he was then used to vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old man ended up with a spine of 48 seconds its preliminary and loaded the 5@@ 9th place of 59 starts . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not just spor@@ ty figure , which moved the attention of the international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ olds would take part at the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians got a special start@@ up from the international life association .
this is distributed to make swimming in succ@@ um@@ ed countries better .
&quot; since in Ethiopia , most athletes walk , do not want to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes itself ready for the big race .
quickly the first names made the round .
some media referred him as &quot; RO@@ BEL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in propor@@ tions of a &quot; well @-@ known &quot; &quot; The Sun Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt &quot; &quot; made itself funny &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he was standing only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ est@@ l , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games in Sydney the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
memorable was the appearance of the lif@@ ter from Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to stand alone in a for@@ ge over 100 meters of Fre@@ est@@ yle .
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically was then folded M@@ ous@@ sam@@ i at that time .
&quot; at the time 22 @-@ year @-@ old , he had to swim eight months before Olymp@@ ics and had never taken such a long distance before competitions . &quot;

accidents - Bus non@@ slip in Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight Ver@@ last
&quot; during an accident of a travel agency , 43 transm@@ itters as chassis , are on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) had been viol@@ ated eight people . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries , divided the police with . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driving force of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ nach had to settle their details according to a counter@@ pul@@ sion , the share of the vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spok@@ es@@ person of the police Aur@@ me / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus self @-@ employed , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire@@ men fre@@ ed the in@@ m@@ ates .
six lif@@ ebo@@ ats and a car parks came to the wrong place on the provincial road 2 .
the in@@ trav@@ eller were brought back by a bus bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the de@@ clin@@ ing and potential witnesses to subscribe to the police .
&quot; the fees per cu@@ bic metres of the water will be charged EUR 1 October 2016 for the area of the wast@@ ew@@ ater , Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( so far : 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( until 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will then increase again if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a sur@@ pass calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf then lie at 4,@@ 37 euro per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( C@@ SU ) reported , when the approval of the budget was established by the land council Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment plants . &quot;
the market of Kas@@ endorf was committed to legal foundations to operate the systems cost @-@ deck@@ ing .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial actu@@ ators from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ endorf , Lop@@ endorf , Lop@@ endorf , Lop@@ es , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg must attack deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
ag@@ it@@ ators are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as administrative leader Herbert Schmidt showed Herbert Schmidt from the panel , was a re @-@ escal@@ ation of fees needed for the se@@ wage of the market . &quot;
&quot; during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , Over@@ - and sub@@ divisions from the previous calendar period will be excluded . &quot;
&quot; the engra@@ ved don@@ ators increased by all three se@@ wage plants around relatively small facilities with a very low waste water resistant , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the small reference basis for example , would affect the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the se@@ wage water in all three systems is slightly declined . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the construction period of all three systems remain not least due to its age of age re@@ financing and repair expenses in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years of age , the facilities for world paper , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , Lin@@ den@@ berg , and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to harm .
&quot; in the p@@ umping station world , the nearly 20 years old convey@@ ors had to be out@@ dated and when the Tei@@ ch@@ ran@@ ch Lop@@ p had to be installed after nearly 20 years of operation of the first cl@@ amp , and an additional ventilation can be installed in future to keep the water@@ legal requirements even in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the un@@ written super@@ vis@@ es and maintenance costs came into account accordingly in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs resulting from previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 still significantly below the current level .
stone houses made clear that in low se@@ wage inf@@ estation in the three plants uses the expenses for operation and maintenance .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market group received by large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plants over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious according to stone houses , especially as one could not extend the supply area of the se@@ wage @-@ purpose Fries@@ en@@ bach@@ tal for these installations . &quot;
Bulgaria turns out inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was in July 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as a positive 0.@@ 2 % . &quot;
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.3 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation of inflation since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.3 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.3 % .
in July 2016 the following groups of consumer goods are observed : food and non@@ talented drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; transport and culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) ;
&quot; the prices fell by clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and rout@@ in@@ ew@@ art@@ ements ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in pre @-@ alcoholic drinks and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; Eff@@ ect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is animated , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ bly towards bre@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , it makes Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already adjacent . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lich@@ tenstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are bl@@ oss@@ om , autonom@@ ous tools , which generate more than 30 million improved selection of sel@@ or per day . &quot;
all failure to get to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have moved into criticism in which they were acc@@ used to act that the app Black@@ face regul@@ ates or white skin as beauty ideal would act .
&quot; when this week some users hit a filter that gave them tu@@ bing , false teeth and un@@ mist@@ aken , there were some critics of the racial car@@ ic@@ ist of Asi@@ ans - &quot; schol@@ ar . &quot;
they asked whether this re@@ peti@@ tive contro@@ vers@@ y has to be a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and sens@@ ations were common on Wednesday wide , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have been disabled . &quot;
the company provided an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but external standing , the r@@ attle @-@ m@@ atism experienced , re@@ minded of the filters of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
other bor@@ row@@ ed the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et have been widely spread across the photos that the filter has been hur@@ t@@ ful and yellow . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to ar@@ gue with the counter@@ part of a very res@@ ist Asian cartoon and the filter@@ effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not logged in , but that the money was pulled into the worth@@ less extrem@@ m was drawn . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ berg .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversi@@ fication and integr@@ ation units , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are in the stuff of race as their older counter@@ players - could be more likely to go out of sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters is a picture created that for a user , it is much more difficult that such matters was un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Zh@@ u , who works as a product man@@ ag@@ erial and engineer for medium , you have called Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in a set of medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that r@@ ally @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y had a lack of diversity in the settings of snap@@ shots at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership and ended up its attachment with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the S@@ ino @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors , who are working there , but not in positions where they are safe or feel at what they say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat was largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points out on its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it is Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a spok@@ es@@ person , the company has recently focused a personnel management , focusing on sub@@ ordin@@ ated population groups and to internal integr@@ ations@@ . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said , in turn , that she will be closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself whether they need more users like us to say that that is not OK . &quot;
military Dec@@ eption of IS@@ IS Secret Services , presents the Committee of Congress
&quot; military @-@ related information , the United States Central Command changed the news of the war against the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual states of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ visional report , created by a task Force of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans members of the dispute @-@ style , intelligence of great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command intelligence service , which reported their duty to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American military intervention in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; News for news , which were sent by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ uren typically , a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism were allowed and were consistently positive as the analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a time @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; what happened to Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses are presented to our political leadership , Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , rep@@ ublic@@ an@@ ic member of the representative house . &quot;
the executive errors in Cent@@ Com are far from the highest peak of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed @-@ proof problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of Ira@@ qi armed forces .
&quot; although there &apos;s no direct reference to that governmental tips under Obama instructions given to change the reports , how an@@ alysts were exposed to pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half @-@ year 2015 there were many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements in front of the Congress considerably more positive than it posed the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com is publicly known that a military recon@@ quest of Mos@@ sul@@ s already started in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , rep@@ ublic@@ ans of Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tips of Central Command has changed the following reports to the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into Life after they had played , the an@@ alysts are concerned with regards to the mani@@ p@@ ulation of reports about the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings throughout the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investig@@ ates of Cent@@ Com reports by the general in@@ spec@@ im@@ ur of the Ministry of Defence in progress . &quot;
&quot; democratic members of the intelligence services published on Thursday its own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com has created a moder@@ ated process for creating reports to IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ qi security services , &quot; &quot; gave the highest @-@ level Dem@@ oc@@ rat in the Com@@ mitt@@ ee , Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; hes@@ it@@ ated the release of news reports , &quot; ash@@ amed the mor@@ als under analy@@ st and &apos; gave little room for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; however , Mr. Shi@@ p and Democrats gave no evidence to have found no evidence of a intervention of the White House with Cent@@ Com analy@@ st regarding a particular political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported from investig@@ ators through the General Insp@@ ector of the Pent@@ agon , which were included according to the complaints from Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press @-@ meeting of the Pent@@ agon , gave in an opinion that the Defence Minister would have no reports of Congress , while the investigation of general in@@ spec@@ tions are still in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave us that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence Ministers embrace a contro@@ vers@@ y discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators have made feedback about the question of a successful aviation campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement , which is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the acc@@ us@@ ations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest cap@@ turing of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of sal@@ ary information about the Islamic State reminds us of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writer on how the former government under George W. Bush anticip@@ ate the recommendations of many an@@ alysts in Iraq and have little time on it to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team asked about Mr. Hoo@@ ker after entering government attacks against the refin@@ ement of the government , since these pro@@ visional refin@@ ing would have had taken into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , reported the Times in September . &quot;
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commands , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III was critic@@ ised by members of the leg@@ is@@ ative due to his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US gain fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; a day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field sto@@ ols team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans w@@ ans with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I belong not to the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; however , they know them : the Americans lie at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain un@@ covered after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will take place on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already been qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which both within their group of six teams will reach the first and second place . &quot;
the first @-@ place will go longer from the way the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may start out , the Americans have triggered a surprisingly vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after having landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time with three years a Hock@@ ey@@ r@@ ack@@ et in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National Park of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Engl@@ ish@@ ham , a trainer of the National Team and thus the things began to turn the better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , an mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the working sp@@ ens@@ um in London that we now have .
we have the flo@@ ck of completely emp@@ t@@ ying .
&quot; on Thursday morning , B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a refund from the local area . &quot;
&quot; India was not gone without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed a surprisingly tough and held the playing distance from 1 @-@ 0 to into the third quarter until B@@ am the game took into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it accomplished a Spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved to the middle and lu@@ cent the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ e@@ pers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs that have so far had to book a gate in any of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games the Zen of the trampoline
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling @-@ resistant and in@@ es@@ capable of a rapid stag@@ gering between competition and pursuit .
&quot; it is , as if the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , from the w@@ rist@@ band to protect the tur@@ ner to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you can not turn on the TV , read a paper or listen to a conversation of your neighbours in the queue , without over Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ af@@ y or the battle between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , would definitely have been sent with this known name that could be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertisement if he would be a swim@@ mer , gymn@@ asts or even fe@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic trampoline around gold . &quot;
the ol@@ ymp@@ ic flame does not illuminated any event equal .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always swim the chest and may reign it for a long time .
&quot; but if I might make hum@@ ble arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me direct the attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has already been a ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 it had been in Sydney it was said , it was the last 16 years so pointed out that many the I asked , did not know that it is at all an Olymp@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the USA saw athletes on competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had made a Ath@@ l@@ ete to the end of 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on the trampoline has a certain aliens , partly because it sounds for an un@@ contaminated ear @-@ proof for a c@@ lown@@ school than those for the Olympic Games sounds . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a rede@@ emed enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous cit@@ ations of his never to end @-@ ben@@ evol@@ ous tre@@ m@@ alls - but also the refin@@ ement of the gym and diving , which are two sports which are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; dates from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling moves ( turning , H@@ ave and sal@@ ts ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ap@@ olog@@ ram after execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
&quot; secondary athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are in Rio against each other . &quot;
the most common ol@@ ymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; Medal must continue in their quest for gold further , faster , upwards and over , sometimes until the end , sometimes go back and back , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only apply the por@@ k or the output , but also in the television transfer there is another well @-@ known target : the world or the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ eful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to raise even a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I think about having this games than a bit ti@@ ring .
of which the trampoline offers an at@@ re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is up .
a backward movement is not the target .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t from , apparently he@@ el@@ os like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes down , then down@@ wards , then effortlessly back upwards . &quot;
&quot; even here there is a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the goal , no cur@@ bs in the distance , only the tr@@ as@@ tical , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and du@@ des of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in stre@@ aming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will shine over the end as part of a afternoon blocks on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia @-@ man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably be over@@ looked at the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
if the thread of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the obj@@ ection of mascul@@ ine Ath@@ l@@ ete - as it sm@@ ote the male US tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal recently . Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to air rin@@ ce ; new fan@@ club .
&quot; a Generation Protest@@ ant &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is a composite of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters are demanding political changes in Ethiopia in violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ ested during the cl@@ ashes with the police were killed .
is Ethiopia straight to cr@@ ying with it ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid exile of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last months of sh@@ aken protests against the government , the country and stretches into more areas . &quot;
last week stor@@ ms thousands of people on the streets and slow@@ ed fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful according to human rights organizations .
witnesses gave us that polic@@ emen gave to zig un@@ armed prot@@ esters and t@@ uns .
&quot; in the or@@ bit of well @-@ being videos about protests , which probably come from the last or beginning of this year , show how security lo@@ ot young people merge with staves , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot;
the Chief of the UN Authority on Human Rights is now asking for a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to maintain this country and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is much appreciated by Nigeria the most pop@@ ulous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians , to fight terrorist attack over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get as much western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dr@@ as@@ tically improved - there is a new p@@ end@@ ent place in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations , continuing the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dis@@ president have been effective to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or pushed into the desert of the desert . &quot;
yet this could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover everything from ground use up to the thro@@ po@@ ise in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions continue along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this qu@@ ack@@ y , contro@@ versi@@ al line called for in June hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts , such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ liber@@ ating front or the National Liber@@ ation of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were more or less forced in recent years to ar@@ ming the turbul@@ ence . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of the bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of the end of a guard under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media as cheap smartphones have been more frequently used and improved the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies that hide from where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave that they gathered themselves to protest themselves .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ es in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons of prosper@@ ous the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly in the Christian highlands , in politics and economy , while they are the Oro@@ mos exploited , of which many Muslims are and live in flat regions . &quot;
but even this is changing exactly .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which are about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in the trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former vine leader , was until his death on a non @-@ coun@@ cils made in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think of corners . &quot;
&quot; an@@ alysts say that it was particularly vers@@ ed to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers , to edit opponent and make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the present regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ clear reasons to assume the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; different from the Lord Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Serbia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services rendered by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had lived a rebel@@ lion in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested according to analy@@ st , according to the analyses of analy@@ st , and subsequently st@@ olen from the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following raid , many protest were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; development experts &quot; &quot; Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary Infra@@ structure planning , as the new p@@ end@@ ent train , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intention of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month of attacked in gon@@ dar , an am@@ ho@@ ical city , of Tig@@ ray @-@ held shops and the hat@@ red towards the Tig@@ ray in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests in the US and other Western allies can bring into a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neigh@@ bou@@ levard of Somalia , even though she recently called that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to support the democracy , he does not want to break its exile in a already vol@@ ati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot; &quot; walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama was founded IS@@ IS is &quot; Sar@@ cas@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried out to sc@@ atter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that his campaign returns , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &apos; founders of the Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clari@@ fying new questions about the communication skills of the presidential and rep@@ ublic@@ ans whether he is able to communicate clear and understandable to the American public .
&quot; it also brings forth his compassion , who will endeav@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful stage in protection to explain in the peculi@@ arity position , statements , which he could not meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having done the clear@@ ing event at a el@@ ectoral event at the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp in relation to asser@@ tion on Thursday and consisted in interviews on that he really did not intend to fix the President and Mrs. Clinton IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp , he was simply s@@ ark@@ tischen . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a number of interviews , he said the ap@@ ologies completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp would help to destroy the statement that Mr. Obama IS@@ IS wants to destroy it , the rep@@ ublic@@ ans presidential race wanted nothing of it . &quot;
the last storm the cri@@ tique of Mr Tru@@ mp came down while he has tried the focus of its campaign for falling re@@ fr@@ ame@@ values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton kept speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this issue .
&quot; on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already given sar@@ cas@@ m to its defence .
&quot; in late July he said strong criticism as he said , the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons E@@ mails , but he said later . &quot; &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then back to the need .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages sent by his fans , as they arrive , and then appropriate &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ p@@ ly the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted a yet estimated sound since its re@@ fr@@ age@@ able values are further gone . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a tour with a great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; during Mr. Tru@@ mp in general tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he acc@@ used his critics frequently to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he has strengthened the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze his loyal Mit@@ stre@@ ite in the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant his statements might be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in an CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asking for the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is in this sense true that Obama IS@@ IS was an almost un@@ familiar , small organization , he called her back@@ war@@ der , totally wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most ma@@ instream @-@ rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to ar@@ gue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as the Secretary General , IS@@ IS allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressive under control . &quot;
&quot; before the el@@ ectoral events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them to be taken on each of his words and to be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he desp@@ ised the &quot; poor , j@@ or@@ able &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; you cannot do it ! . &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked on Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s exc@@ use as only one more evidence that he is not suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; most viewed via the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ worn café in William@@ sburg , where you can only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years with good coffee . &quot;
of course the prices of his Bedford Avenue Lad@@ front has been displ@@ aced .
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 was sold , sold so@@ ap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people smo@@ ked it as last loss in an gent@@ a city .
&quot; the artist in Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ass wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a so@@ ap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York Change is , it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ year staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when he offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ lay , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , be@@ held much . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els , the same es@@ pres@@ som@@ ing model . &quot;
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and cheese and there are Gar@@ ni@@ ers like KA@@ Per@@ n and A@@ ck@@ ated oni@@ ons .
there are natural keys .
&quot; the café serves no beer more , but there are fresh fruit ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , that he noticed a steady stream of old tri@@ bal customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed through prizes in William@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , dwelt in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after they had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way up . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee shop , she said . &quot;
&quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verse , which was liked to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even though she ordered a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea in this day , which is another new addi@@ tive . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inev@@ it@@ ably always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss flash@@ ing and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with but@@ ter to , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he has no co@@ ll about it , that the so@@ ap business has taken the old business . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to produce a special so@@ ap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ hot coffee of the cafes as an ingre@@ dient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents of Green@@ points , the café also accepted . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish , and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he gave them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has its advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ locally would like to fill the cold coffee to the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding on a dis@@ advant@@ ageous building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favorites .
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was chief , and said that he was destroyed at the ground as the Café closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ ile said that the beg@@ ining of the locom@@ otive and the order was a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ w@@ ling it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich@@ est meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as gour@@ mets he had president Roos@@ ev@@ elt a Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ chicken soup .
&quot; his menu on this day was a bit hum@@ ble , filled Eg@@ gs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , pot@@ ato har@@ sh@@ ree and as dessert a p@@ av@@ d@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans , how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both the food histor@@ ies .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was one of the Chinese food in the U.S. , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine while the Great depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , as they meet with a re@@ por@@ ter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ apps di@@ p in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese with olive @-@ piece , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with pot@@ ato har@@ sh@@ ree and vegetable . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ por@@ ter h@@ ackers ordered , this was the pair for a discussion about eating in the era of the great depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ anu@@ t , liver , and b@@ bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingre@@ dient and a bit more cheap@@ ly made of the ingre@@ dient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ est .
&quot; it needs to be placed in the stomach such as lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; during the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American household , mainly in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women bo@@ died for male fiel@@ d@@ workers and it was served fresh b@@ aked past@@ es for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who sent food to star@@ ve Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; stands out the ways that the country turned out to be no longer the bat @-@ land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans a central , an@@ ed subject was founded , &quot; talented co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as ten@@ se was the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ ki : mysterious foods such as lo@@ aves and ch@@ asser@@ ia have become basic nutri@@ tious , the ch@@ asser@@ tion as a &quot; wonderful way , Es@@ sens@@ ants , &quot; mer@@ ated Zi@@ egel@@ man , since chefs could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a Cre@@ ed sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry .
&quot; meat , for years the center of the American cuisine was , became a rare luxury . &quot;
peculi@@ ar mix@@ es were tried because a cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority to taste or even healthy kitchen .
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes includes , prepared Zi@@ egel@@ man a dish from that epoch , b@@ aked oni@@ ons with pe@@ anu@@ t but@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addi@@ tive at the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t but@@ ter and b@@ aked on@@ ion do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the family recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , ex@@ agger@@ ated budget - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country such as such . &quot;
&quot; published their recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; budget &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform the cre@@ m@@ ess sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historic treats . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ cake @-@ meal @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he pra@@ ised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s cuisine of its cuisine , he pointed out like the millions of the severe man of the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ urs continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and carried out a tu@@ x@@ king .
he was wonderful real@@ ign@@ ation .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have been committed to the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or could have asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the editor of an house@@ ke@@ eper had no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt that the White House brought forth the boring house in Washington but also one of the most prepared food prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food to handle , was rejected once the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on cal@@ ories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as to how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple gave me better understood when writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man re@@ minded : &quot; she made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind @-@ exploited .
&quot; after the dish at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s ab@@ vac@@ ated , she and Co@@ e came out a dessert that had prepared them at home : the p@@ avilion , the President Roos@@ ev@@ elt to noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une wh@@ ip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a great trick , hum@@ ble recipes will send a name to miss . &quot;
&quot; there was no shif@@ ted cream , just pl@@ ums , some fl@@ our , sugar , water and c@@ innamon . &quot;
everyone emerg@@ ent something rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a sp@@ oon in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly tasted it not bad .
en@@ du@@ ck three times a post@@ ure .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer said to his wife , &quot; A few geh@@ ogs wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o
he set his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save the lives of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died on a façade attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; &quot; White Hel@@ mets &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group that has previously saved his life according to 6@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 Volunte@@ ers put their own life on the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war region .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil protection , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a cleansing from the ruins of a house , went around the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans for the shining symbol in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; but as a hero he has never seen himself , &quot; according to the picture : &quot; for me that is the true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I can save life , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar fell an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the hel@@ icopter have rejected four wall bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing difficulties . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the toxic remains of bom@@ b , so that not children play with it , c@@ ited the picture his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad has to meet terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest spine is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Gre@@ enland @-@ ha@@ y usually occur only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Gre@@ enland comes only with 150 years of off@@ spring .
&quot; frag@@ ments of the Gre@@ enland at the bottom of the North Atlantic on the bottom of the North Atlantic in an hour , it is at the average of 1,@@ 220 meters far . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five meters long animal up at s@@ atte 2.@@ 6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a robot . &quot;
but this of long@@ itude of lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science &quot; at least of a Gre@@ enland @-@ shar@@ k at the age of 392 .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ controll@@ lein by Max Planck Institute for dem@@ ographic research in Rostock this way of life , which means for sp@@ inal animals a world record . &quot;
&quot; though , the evolution of evolution has long been known that Gre@@ enland @-@ ha@@ y are being painted . &quot;
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Gre@@ enland @-@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sk@@ inny co@@ asts of Canada , Gre@@ enland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive at the surface mostly only in winter . &quot;
about the lifestyle of Gre@@ enland researchers know researchers according to little .
your Zeit@@ l@@ up@@ emp@@ o ma@@ ze them when they used six animals in front of six animals with a transmitter .
&quot; boot@@ y make this shar@@ ks anyway : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a robot , another had the or@@ thodon@@ tic of a young ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s . &quot;
possibly it sle@@ eves sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for K@@ ada@@ ver that tor@@ ments from higher water layers down .
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Gre@@ enland @-@ ha@@ y , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Gr@@ ön@@ land or Spit@@ s@@ bergen , from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 inches long while the largest 502 cen@@ timet@@ res .
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , analysed it with the carbon @-@ 14 method the ruler of the hair . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ et is already created before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ cy@@ cle@@ us .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 19@@ 60@@ s , as a nuclear @-@ prolifer@@ ation in the atmosphere of this radio@@ active carbon . &quot;
&quot; in which with 220 cen@@ timeters length of the smallest animal contained the lens against against it a low over@@ shot of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear w@@ af@@ er , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all major Gr@@ ön@@ land har@@ es in their lens against normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities that arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeters long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai became an age of 335 years , during the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ timeters even 392 years old might be . &quot;
&quot; that Gre@@ enland @-@ females only get descendants until they are longer than four metres , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers in the length could be assigned to an age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 392 cen@@ timeters probably stood at the thres@@ hold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years ago , Gre@@ enland @-@ ha@@ y is obviously at least one and a half @-@ centuries . &quot;
also this may be for sp@@ inal flu@@ ids at the moment .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme mainly live in icy waters is no coinci@@ dence .
&quot; the previous record fix@@ tures , a 211 years old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck a 120 years old Har@@ po@@ en@@ spitze was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures often the body of the animals live there on as@@ parag@@ us . &quot;
they are mature later - and al@@ ted s@@ lower .
&quot; to warm water up in cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; for the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal heat bur@@ sts . &quot;
the heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on it , as soon as possible as many descendants as possible , explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
a very big animal should rather invest in a long life on the other hand .
construction @-@ based in double @-@ pack
&quot; with themes around the building , the council has been focused in the recent session . &quot;
with relief the panel took the message of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that will finally start the marketing of the youngest living areas .
&quot; after the basis of the estate , par@@ zel@@ li@@ fication and final questions were clari@@ fied and the mot@@ ions were posed , the sale of the plots in the residential area &quot; crossing &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Ex@@ traction section 1 ) to prosp@@ ective buyers nothing more in the way . &quot;
the par@@ der@@ at is convinced that the mess@@ engers in the rural and quiet residential neighborhood of beautiful young families and r@@ ile elderly alike exc@@ eeded .
&quot; as it was called , buil@@ ders can report immediately on the Town Hall , regarding the allocation of plots will be advised in its September session . &quot;
&quot; to also change requests for sett@@ les of other commercial companies , associated with the creation of jobs , we decided to change the municipal council , which only changed in the spring of this year , re@@ produced in part of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of sub @-@ time , the estate is already proven by two plots towards the national road 2112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the Main has dem@@ arc@@ ades the best chances in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract the best opportunities from London . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether money buildings continue to operate from London from finance to the entire EU . &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport the approval in the UK is enough for the so @-@ called EU passport .

&quot; in a cr@@ ack contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s hidden behind the wrong interpre@@ tations and re@@ pul@@ ling with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax expl@@ ores . &quot;
&quot; it is usual for US presidential elections to publish their tax expl@@ ores , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New Yorker &apos;s busin@@ es@@ sman , and his lawyers have stated as the reason for its den@@ ial a tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;

&quot; on Thursday , she spoke the topic also during a speech about the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he refuse to do what every other presidential race has done in recent decades and publish his tax expl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; pol@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has paid no or very little taxes on Friday , and an economic amount of New York Times on Friday may be a series of tax ev@@ asion and tax advis@@ ors that might still be the case . &quot;
allies have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ et that would make sure people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a vote event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ alization gl@@ omer@@ ate has its headquarters here to exchange their tax ev@@ asion . &quot;
&quot; buff@@ et said , he was also subjected to a tax examination of the IR@@ S , and Tru@@ mp have &quot; fear &quot; against the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot;
Cl@@ int@@ ons campaign has published tax declaration until the year 2007 .
&quot; Cl@@ int@@ ons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax turnover of about 4@@ 0.1 % . &quot;
the tax return of the Cl@@ int@@ ons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 perceived as wage of wages compared to most of the Americans .
&quot; its main objective was an economical index fund , from which the Cl@@ int@@ ons divi@@ den@@ ds and revenue of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 hidden . &quot;

previously there are many sp@@ ers used to defend themselves .
Friday is dedicated to the telephone number which is dedicated to the animal protection .
&quot; since then we have developed the ...

Jewish Director defe@@ ats Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arabic &quot; challenge - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots escap@@ ed a media watch , after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre @-@ election since it would have been an Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ au@@ st@@ document &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; sent his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried Israel to find a list of hotels available in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via a private call center . &quot;
after a statement exam@@ ining the director at the hotel &apos;s reception .
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel provided that the measure is a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the &quot; Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason , the behind it stood , rede@@ emed in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they demanded that the pres@@ election is deleted , was c@@ ited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli Ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ commerce &quot; &quot; called this one &quot; big shame &quot; , &quot; the South German newspaper reports . &quot;
we were dis@@ solved by this event and trou@@ bled .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this is due in Germany this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions draws , &quot; &quot; said the ministry . &quot;
&quot; the incident , a pretty big reson@@ ance on the internet , in which people saw the whole of a scan@@ dal . &quot;
some talked to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that had given the inn@@ ero@@ sion of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; ash@@ amed of you , called it in another post , in which it was noted that the hotel , which is located at the no@@ des Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ da@@ mm near the synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel proved to quickly all acc@@ us@@ ations of himself and called the incident , and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reported the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct statement , Israel would not include into the quick@@ ers list , the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung proclaimed a spok@@ es@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the country @-@ election has now been added .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % to - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly to businesses in the country , distributed the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections to Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 was increased by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 rise and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
in particular the Russian imports of exports to Iran around 9@@ 1.5 per cent spr@@ ink@@ age and bet@@ ched $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade fair was reached by deliveries of machinery , land @-@ witnesses and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian colonies was held around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , first line Travel ev@@ is@@ as , an Irish citizen . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries that affects the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record of Ira@@ qi tourists in Russia will be broken from the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians do Iran , something , of which the amb@@ assador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Sh@@ ir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition said . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms at home as Br@@ ite Gold for Rad@@ sport
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the fl@@ y@@ team Spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to Ru@@ f@@ ame as the British team announced the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ al role , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the j@@ une and made the legend proud to settle a victory from the favorite New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory for four years ago , while Ho@@ y had the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals . &quot;
&quot; she reiter@@ ated the trick , after they took place in March at the Bahn World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ dri@@ er Jam@@ ie Staff .
they did this in time as those of the emerging .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ ring made a gap that k@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man who remained with whom they saw , when they saw potential in the vill@@ i , which has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who made four years ago with Ho@@ y triumph@@ ed - and Sk@@ inner played a Olympic stadium in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ardis@@ ed of the New Year in the first lap . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap was short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner stopped . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a great part of the transformation , when Hin@@ ding in a higher gear , to slow it down , and allow sc@@ ep@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as an BBC expert , and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they came to the ped@@ est@@ al . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make my name a name .
in the end we put up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defe@@ ated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the tri@@ umph 2012 at the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there was Hin@@ des that he fell on the railway after a weak start .
he returned to this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England .
&quot; with such a victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; said : &quot; it feels with the whole GB flags on the ble@@ achers like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many world tracks , that it was incredible to win again at the Olymp@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; this is an event that won a gold medal for the nation , the seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months is that we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
&quot; with the form Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of possible that he has repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three ol@@ ymp@@ ic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; this would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently p@@ lig@@ ent date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a cul@@ mination of six gold medals and a Silver medal . &quot;
the cheese of the testi@@ cles is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Spr@@ int next day and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ year from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the Knights . &quot;
&quot; it was the only new competition for the day , but there was more good news for England . &quot;
Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ minute walk . &quot;
they came in 3 : 51,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
&quot; the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord , the 2012 in London Gold won at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with safety in focus . &quot;
he had sung himself yesterday with refer@@ ees in front of the qualification than him called function@@ aries to measure his body size .
&quot; in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , tomorrow , and ended , av@@ anc@@ ered Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in space period in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team leaves itself on its strong train team to domin@@ ate the medium period of Olympic Games and to pick a ch@@ ar of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio was rund@@ own . &quot;
&quot; it played in the background , as the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical guidance Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April within the middle of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es , as well as reti@@ ring of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees itself the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like this now legendary reputation of GB@@ s who has reached his climax once again . &quot;
the future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract
&quot; the future of the aluminium @-@ mel@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as the hundreds of jobs of workers - are standing on the game , since the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thereby raise all supply agreements as the lie@@ uten@@ de energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government at Victoria in the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant . &quot;
for 20 years the payout in@@ vention runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be at one closing time .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ oes effects since the mel@@ ting is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa , the Point Henry mel@@ ting , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Austr@@ al@@ ischen dollar and last but due to the electricity price for the installation . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which over@@ sh@@ ale the large aluminium @-@ mel@@ ight with its Lo@@ y Yang A power@@ plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three further owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L goes out that the plant is still operated in Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt tion , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L still said that the Tre@@ aties will be called &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have been in force starting November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Tre@@ aties have a 12 @-@ month period of cancellation , so that they will end 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this , AG@@ L goes out that the contracts in the financial year will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the power supply . &quot;
all potential implications for the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong appointments for wholes@@ ale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L divided , that it has already written the value of the Tre@@ aties in its annual amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; capacity of Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; the mel@@ ting and power supply to the mel@@ ting will not be com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; the US @-@ company said that it was completed in 2010 a 20 @-@ year treaty with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still a declaration guilty why it has res@@ igned by the contract . &quot;
an@@ alysts war@@ n due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ tics at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ aw@@ att and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ aw@@ att . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , which would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ da@@ shi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the sept@@ ember of the Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ denom@@ in@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ i and mother of the Kar@@ da@@ shi@@ an @-@ J@@ enni@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted sept@@ ember of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and ran out on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to the we@@ eping , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ vei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bar@@ gain ( or simply Ke@@ eping up with the Kar@@ da@@ shi@@ an &apos;s family ( with exception of the problem of Rob and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ yn ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and ends with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the kl@@ ash holding action nearly every birthday and a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; you were able to forget ? &quot; , &quot; with the honest@@ y of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this Public@@ ity . &quot;
with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue has begun a new era of the Kar@@ da@@ shi@@ ans .
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim likes it , what the Vo@@ gue covers , have be@@ aten ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September magazine is a le@@ ague for itself . &quot;
the September edition for Vo@@ gue is the most sold @-@ selling issue of the year .
&quot; with a circumference that resem@@ bles rather a screen by a modem , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the r@@ amp@@ er 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ vei@@ ling of his Cover@@ stars is expected so worth @-@ addi@@ ctive , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still crosses the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ om@@ i Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , clearly more &quot; celeb@@ rities , the model@@ s &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; are on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ te and th@@ or @-@ brand amb@@ assador Lawrence was 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga &apos;s honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Ms J@@ denom@@ in@@ ator - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; flow @-@ model &quot; &quot; of its generation - below the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or Reality stars or young people of today who know how to set a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true on the in@@ ator ) .
they are really talented women who are exhibiting in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had been with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like to succeed .
with their Reality @-@ TV history was J@@ enn@@ ers position in the fashion world always ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ denom@@ in@@ ator and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the mist@@ ress of the eyel@@ id . &quot;
&quot; these feelings could be back high , when the message came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover . &quot;
but riding on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut it seems to go on the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ denom@@ in@@ ator is on the cover of the September &apos;s edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters are selling you images of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
it sold by her done pictures from C@@ indy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine love .
and in their free time she is at Reality TV to see . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; common @-@ centres centres in 16@@ 0,000 people each year &quot;
more than 16@@ 0.000 of the mer@@ gers of the country are rejected every year by the coun@@ cils @-@ centres throughout the sector on the effects of other medi@@ ations on already over@@ load transactions .
&quot; in Queens@@ land there are already three of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for odd Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ages and similar - in their assu@@ mp@@ tions on free legal couns@@ elling and legal status . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ dated , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , this legal centers will lose further 30 per cent of their federal states . &quot;
&quot; the director of the simil@@ arities of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of community centers revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation without a repe@@ al of the resolution of the Federal Government would only be worse .
&quot; Queens@@ land council centres are chronic , what does thousands of people are of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with uns@@ ur@@ able and impressive debts , families , which were released by separ@@ ations , workers who have un@@ just cast problems - all these people have problems legal nature and this collection shows that they may not get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will cut funds from June 2017 , which means thousands of help need@@ less people from Queens@@ land shall be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the gener@@ osity and Federal Minister of Federal Minister as well as the Sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to raise these mid@@ range as soon as possible , allowing people to obtain the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government filled its commitments , resources for legal assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now at the time to see the needs of the community centers and their customers , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work . &quot;

&quot; after having regard the local and regional campaign management , Bor@@ dini made that already at least four more persons had made the same experience with Philli@@ p , he was in the indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be dism@@ is@@ sed to pass damage , &quot; &quot; Bor@@ dini &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the SPD parties and CD@@ U . &quot;
this was representative of the opinion of the opinion of the public research institution IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while red @-@ black government agencies in the north could be more re@@ igned in the north , this is not possible after the re@@ fr@@ ame@@ values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both countries , the SPD would be the strongest party and have had good chances to continue to face the government . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD thre@@ w the SPD 6 percent five years ago at 24 percent .
&quot; according to the survey , the party took only just shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is contro@@ versi@@ al between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left fighters to 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be present at 19 percent for the first time . &quot;
the green in spite of mild losses by 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) returns to the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the country at 3 percent .
&quot; according to the Member States of the survey , the SPD of the survey took only 23 percent to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent by 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are thus still behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Parliament .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss the place in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and the Internet in Zeit@@ l@@ upe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator on the market .
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - his maker lived a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half a kil@@ ograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thick@@ er and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would be today for about two sel@@ fish with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &apos; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros lovers can still buy the devices still on the internet , but they come from the St@@ one@@ age of the dormitory . &quot;
&quot; however , 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish cell@@ ular phone manufacturers had previously announced the product a few months previously on the Computer@@ messe C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the west format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator to achieve . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , although agon@@ izing slowly . &quot;
a pocket calcul@@ ators was available to a digital addres@@ see and an electronic calendar .
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be re@@ done similar to a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphones in Germany was at 392 Euro .
nobody could have imag@@ ined in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator of the beginning of the smartphone era would be .
since then everything is different .
the clever teleph@@ ones are a success story , if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile @-@ card of the Finn@@ s lived an un@@ preced@@ ented des@@ aster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and executed . &quot;
the market today domin@@ ate the market that all came a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere be online that is today for a very many people everyday life .
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; sold around 1,@@ 4 billion devices , by Samsung and Apple it falls 555 million pieces . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
these are the well @-@ running business of the numerous App @-@ providers and telecommunic@@ ation .
all around the smartphone have now developed a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market appeared only in the beginning of 2007 and announced the Apple leader Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communication , everything per touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , which had conqu@@ ered the market . &quot;
&quot; finally , you have disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the S@@ ear@@ ing have now Apple and Asian provider such as Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its in@@ vention a self @-@ compreh@@ ension .
&quot; in the cut , each German has now look on his mobile phone for 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we need to learn all to put the smartphone even sometimes , &quot; said exactly Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Management Board responsible for personnel . &quot;
permanent expan@@ da@@ bility is now regarded as a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must guide the ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and extend Heathrow
&quot; Heathrow will not only bring you to our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me that was the biggest attraction of He@@ thro@@ ws , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we had a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions were benef@@ ited by the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; we will achieve this , and we will achieve new opportunities for local resident and companies in the vicinity of Heathrow . &quot;
&quot; for our local communities we will create a 10,000 new appr@@ enti@@ ces to create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; just as they were ahead of London in 2012 , it will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ art@@ ws is too great . &quot;
I told me that England never will be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ aze us on the world stage .
the two @-@ wing had been wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow .
&quot; there are always obstacles to dis@@ appearance , but Heathrow answers each given question . &quot;
like the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for a single Infra@@ structure project .
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to hum@@ ili@@ ent growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both at the airport and in the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in Heathrow , which has been launched a £ 11 billion in a budget , from T5 - the five years in a row for the world &apos;s best airport was built , to the T2 , which was built in the midst of the two @-@ frequ@@ ented dur@@ ations of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to supply a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investments . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one .
&quot; it is time that we bro@@ aden this ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and create Heathrow , and create a legacy of skills and employment to which England can be proud of . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; regarding adverti@@ sers
&quot; for companies who make money with On@@ line@@ value money , according to one of the software &apos;s attempts to handle adverti@@ sers , a &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would release ad lock@@ ings on his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side , published Ad@@ block Plus a blog@@ post to blo@@ cking their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday shared Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coding in terms of its advertisements in order to detect the display , which part of the page advertising is to ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ate . &quot;
but Ad@@ block pro@@ claim that it has found a new way to deal with new codes .
&quot; in a blog@@ post the spok@@ es@@ man wrote by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ fight between the turn @-@ loos@@ ening Open Source Community and the res@@ ellers have already been underway since the in@@ vention of adverti@@ sers in the event , and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world @-@ largest company has left the fight for social media in the fight , is a strong indi@@ gn@@ ation of being wor@@ rying to the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people ad , nearly four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 15,000 per day active users who access Facebook through their mobile devices , making hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 percent of the adverti@@ sed Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has used it on display recorder on Desktop PCs apart , because mobile ad rec@@ ed@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs is making a sufficient large proportion of revenue , so that Facebook appears to be the investment of such step as re@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday shared Facebook with , that it would be to update his &quot; ad pre@@ matur@@ ation tool &quot; to have more control over it over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook assumed that Ad@@ blo@@ c new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page , which are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users this does not represent a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , distributed a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; adverti@@ sers are a steady tool , which is why we concentrated instead of developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control in the hands of the people . &quot;
wife in susp@@ ected su@@ ic@@ ide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses in having a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a susp@@ ected su@@ ic@@ ide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the Canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a silence at the age of 49 years , consisting of several vehicles , including a load carriage , was transferred to even kill . &quot;
it still died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already heard that some are still not identified , the police told these as well as any witnesses of the incident to come up . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation is told G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Trib@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
however it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoi@@ dable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ ut@@ or must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers cannot be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - when a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers will not go beyond that a ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans run in the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
&quot; last year a polic@@ eman of driving pot@@ tery was acqu@@ itted , after they over@@ ride a man and killed that in August 2014 , one night was on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year victims had dr@@ unk and has become the street unconscious .
&quot; the Court set that the polic@@ eman -- that responded to a not@@ ation -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was an &quot; totally unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should register with the police on number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Kli@@ mam@@ o@@ dell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
Venus had probably been inhabited according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model probably once .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms that resem@@ bles those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus with their hot , water @-@ free surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once pushed @-@ like conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously understood that the slow revers@@ al of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points to that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere , and yet slowly . &quot;
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet was probably more dry land than the earth , but had once enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and res@@ ett@@ led more quickly . &quot;
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation exp@@ on@@ ated the slow revers@@ al of Venus its grid side of the sun nearly two months long , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which affects the surface of a large part of the sun war@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the result is average @-@ temperatures , which are a few degree of cooler than that of the earth today . &quot;
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution previously created by Plan@@ etary resear@@ cher .
although they were once inhab@@ itable was the Venus -- in the course of several billion years of --@@ zu@@ by much heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light exposed .
your oceans were dar@@ ker and their water@@ da@@ mp@@ f was burned down from ultra @-@ avi@@ olet light .
&quot; as their Hydro@@ gen , only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , which as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

&quot; the company said that additional cuts in the enterprise gives the space required to come through the market down@@ turn . &quot;
&quot; shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to give up his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alized his business activities as a result of its meg@@ az@@ ing cooperation with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure , economic situation due to lower raw materials under pressure , an economic situation which had strengthened by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish parliament member Dave Ander@@ son met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the greatest occupational disputes which have been held since a generation in the North Sea .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a business that works for many and not only for a few works , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,@@ 4 billion euros will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea in comparison with an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the Pl@@ ple@@ ads
&quot; the latest mission with Ke@@ pler &apos;s space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers , the complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ple@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star cluster are rotating to different edges , as well as in what connection are the rotation @-@ time rooms with the planetary exploration . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we read through the compar@@ isons of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a resear@@ cher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ christ@@ enings of the Pl@@ ei@@ c lies 445 light @-@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this star cluster , which originated about 125 million years ago , are now reaching an adult . &quot;
you are now turning on the fastest .
&quot; lead to peak of peak rates , these gri@@ pping stars also encounter large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since this win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
if a star switch off his rotation rate begins to slow@@ down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zes the time between the show of a recogni@@ z@@ able constell@@ ation -- like sun@@ spots -- recogni@@ zes .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates points out that massive stars are more slow than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dances , with larger stars s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ters are turning on smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Pl@@ ple@@ ads , we see that slow rot@@ ors to be massive , while faster rot@@ ors will be able to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star cluster of the Pl@@ ple@@ ads is so close , it serves as an ide@@ ological cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the constell@@ ation of the Pl@@ ple@@ ads offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rot@@ ation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the How , When and why stars slow@@ ing up their rotation rates and so@@ cks of their &quot; dancing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three times in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pl@@ ple@@ ads which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a contro@@ versi@@ al bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs
the t@@ ears went by Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball @-@ Star in the best days of Base to base .
&quot; after his emotional revers@@ al announcement , the 41 years old pro will be a last time against the Tampa Bay R@@ ays a last time the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos;s &quot; , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ star All @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected as the most valuable player of the League in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a tenth year deal has been awarded to him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contracts on 31 December 2017 , he will be arranged in future as consultants and youth coach - at full distance . &quot;
as players paid it Rodri@@ gu@@ ez long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es created some mil@@ estones . &quot;
with the Hall of Fame @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e Ma@@ ys there are only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
&quot; however , in the glory of the bas@@ eb@@ alls , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old might not be recorded . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - Nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Ro@@ d &quot; &quot; - in the field was , so contro@@ versi@@ al is its appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star presented at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 saw bot@@ an@@ ed ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis until the end of 2014 for 211 games . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as captain , for years to have an anti @-@ aging clinic in Süd @-@ Florida . &quot;
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot;
even his far@@ ewell days are not running smoothly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball leg@@ ends in their last games still get the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit often on the bank . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a far@@ ewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , the Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; at least Rodri@@ gu@@ ez got married , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and actress K@@ ate Hudson , the sympathy of fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ di@@ ous Boston red SO@@ x . &quot;

&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first D@@ op@@ ing@@ es &quot;
knowing : because of a positive di@@ op@@ ing@@ ray may not start weight@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
a bl@@ ur@@ ring Ath@@ ad could have won almost a medal .
&quot; prior to the seventh race day , the first official d@@ op@@ sis of the Olympic Games has become known in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight@@ th@@ ever Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil and exp@@ elled directly before the beginning of the anyway cri@@ tic competitions come to this news at the time of time . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en , the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de had been proven in the last Sunday that is used as a m@@ ative means for dop@@ amine . &quot;
the International Sports Court CAS CAS confirmed on Friday morning except for the exclusion of the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ fly only by 0.@@ 09 seconds they missed the bronze medals .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to take part in the fo@@ oth@@ s over 50 m Fre@@ est@@ yle .
he has requested the opening of the B rehear@@ sal and a hearing in the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association will take the matter very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation in investigations , &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanctions of the ath@@ l@@ ete with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio sick@@ ened the message about the positive trial at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old then went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV Channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is in@@ no@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplement , &quot; explained the lightweight . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is expected to act in the exp@@ unding substance by the blood @-@ offering EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was pro@@ visional suspended , according to B@@ NT also the B sample has already been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w en@@ acted as soon as possible with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ation .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right shots , &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all the weight@@ lif@@ ter from the chron@@ ically @-@ related nation did not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday was also known the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; , &quot; the London Olymp@@ ics in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before positive to the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid n@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both are taking the intake , both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
in front of the start of the sa@@ ath@@ l@@ ete is especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa a further heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
&quot; the World Association I@@ A@@ AF had the complete Russian team up to an exception because of systematic no@@ op@@ ings to the start , even the dec@@ eption of Kenya produces in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the life of life , the earlier compar@@ es in China had also taken care of the athletes . &quot;
so grip the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ p .

&quot; if I see the po@@ dium over 200 m Fre@@ est@@ l , I want to pass myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;

&quot; I have no time and no respect for intelligence sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;

Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ ecting h@@ ackers their ran@@ s@@ om
programmers of compres@@ sor m@@ alware are currently targeted companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a current survey of m@@ alware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of the requested companies in the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of an attack with pres@@ ser software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of firms were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
40 percent of the victims paid some will@@ ingly prepared by the offen@@ ders to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators are specialized their pres@@ ser @-@ software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; are they successful there , the potentially pressing ran@@ s@@ om falls significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of harm software , &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then we discovered the perpet@@ rators software for itself .
&quot; first , he did not use the goal , but the change to company attacks occurred in the past months terri@@ bly quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware is working after a simple sample : once on the computer of a victim , she is specifically looking for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as to archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encrypted the Ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustainable .
&quot; afterwards , the software presents the demands of the pres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ tion Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , the company is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is mis@@ leading . &quot;
&quot; accordingly higher the damage falls , if a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break the operation completely , in case of cases men were in lifestyle . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals are victims of attacks , whose patient can be threatened by the loss of n@@ ac@@ credit@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : paid not , it thereby promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in the light of down@@ time . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know that and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety resear@@ cher of F @-@ secure user accounts and contact the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their sacrific@@ es by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t any example files . &quot;
&quot; and we shall redeem individuals after payments of a few hundred percent , the company must be able to negotiate on a hard drive and pay five st@@ elli@@ ge sums to ref@@ rain their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware ext@@ or@@ tion , the h@@ acker are always professional and share the work , explains safety experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from the Anti@@ virus provider Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is possible that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmer sell their damage software then in the form of a software building at the actual black@@ sm@@ ser .
&quot; the former m@@ alware kits were created by the m@@ alware , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; delivery includes a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configurations that can be modified and Brand@@ ing , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the pres@@ ser are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the fresh@@ ly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so it lo@@ gs in one of the forums in the underground , purchases the set of a crime and also commissioned another to install the software on the best of many PCs . &quot;
payment is made per in@@ consistent calculator .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als then sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread &quot; , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
&quot; by now , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that make their data better . &quot;
more than 50 per cent of firms in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes pol@@ l trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes pol@@ l trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file Back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful experience , the perpet@@ rators are held instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with this , the damage potential for the type of data is still higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the offen@@ ders may take completely new goals in the internet of things . &quot;
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrates security resear@@ cher how they could get started with the Internet connected thermo@@ stat in their control .
in the middle of winter the fre@@ eing of such a rec@@ u@@ ated heating could well be worth a ran@@ s@@ om .
&quot; if the offen@@ ders then instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will un@@ pack all : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini @-@ water . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , proves to be very flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,60 has high HR @-@ V rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the tor@@ ond . there is no place in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , just the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls into something . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V at the storage box .
&quot; it is not just a trunk of 453 l at highly @-@ appointed and 10@@ 26 l for wr@@ apped back @-@ ups , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , as it sounds : the seat areas of the back@@ seat can be polished as Kin@@ os@@ arm@@ chair and thus offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to the ceilings 1,@@ 24 m . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , however , the charging height is 650 mm somewhat higher than the compar@@ ative Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; the tested 1,@@ 6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large swi@@ vel ranges very powerful . &quot;
&quot; however , his work is likely to be silent . &quot;
pleas@@ ing is the everyday life of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is still another motor : a 1.5 @-@ l gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the chassis is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
the steering is likely to be more direct .
&quot; the equipment is in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; executive &quot; &quot; no desires open . &quot;
among the safety systems the City @-@ Not@@ br@@ aking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) the coll@@ ision system and the donation wiz@@ ard super@@ visor .
&quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ned sometimes , because he has been evaluated in the ran@@ ch many obstacles as &quot; &quot; extrac@@ ting objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;

and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ eg@@ ler respon@@ ds to the traffic sign and dro@@ pping when needed the speed .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are lying under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something to reach .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; who do not want to invest so much , the gas@@ oline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;

Air@@ line cannot be held : fall on flight &apos;s bridge
a Air@@ line cannot be held liable for the fall of a passenger on the air bridge .
&quot; for a liability is concei@@ vable only with dangers which are typical of air traffic , argu@@ ed the Upper Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the Kl@@ äger had broken down with the fall of a knee @-@ hunt .
&quot; however , the accident could have happen everywhere - it is a general risk of living , so the judgment . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease : when paid the organis@@ er
&quot; paid holiday makers get only money after their journey , if the cause of the disease is du@@ bi@@ ased in the hotel . &quot;
but this is only the case when more than ten per cent of the guests have to show the same symptoms .
in the wast@@ ed case a family was heavy on the second day of her tur@@ qu@@ ur@@ ry heavy of diar@@ rhe@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting .
she spent almost the whole vacation in the room .
her illness led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back on a def@@ ective joints that suppos@@ edly had the sea@@ water poll@@ uted .
the family was the view that the journey was so faul@@ ty - and def@@ endant against the organis@@ er .
in court the reb@@ els had no success .
though the plumbing was indeed def@@ ective .
&quot; however , the organis@@ er took only shortly before the departure of the Kl@@ äger . &quot;
he had to go beyond that the sea water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially in the samples of water no cont@@ amination were found .
&quot; the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ red , through an@@ st@@ eck@@ ung among each other - belong to general life risk . &quot;
by 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 erk@@ ill .
&quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , following the violence of refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have concern about further attacks . &quot;
the state was prov@@ oked and decided to react at the same time .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hate and split .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this tri@@ umph we will not treat the terrorists . &quot;
&quot; if criminal proceedings has to leave the country , the increase of safety and strength also the consent of the population for the refuge@@ e policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning to implement the proposals made by the German Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel ampli@@ fication of the security forces , namely in the middle of medium @-@ class sizes over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ iz@@ ers for terrorism must be back on punishment .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the tru@@ ction should be so power@@ fully adapted to the purchase of weapons in the Internet . &quot;
the last much discussed silence @-@ light for doctors should be washed following de Ma@@ st@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to seek out in dialogue with the anger for solutions just as the threat of the citizens could reduce , he said with a view of psychological points . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; for the persecution of criminal in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of compres@@ sors . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to the safety further . &quot;
it was important that the interior ministers have clearly spoken against action .

better transport flow on the highway
it is regularly on the envel@@ ope - here is a picture of November .
but that should change : the legal ab@@ esp@@ ace is to be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all the cars of motor@@ cyclists who stand in traffic on the ambient street every evening in St@@ au , when they drive over the motorway of Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road @-@ road construction extends to the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer , and the exit V@@ eler road to the right foot of 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then be directly connected directly from the hammer street on the right .
&quot; the big advantage : traffic shares an early stage , thus reducing the overall impact on the multi @-@ driven section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the District of Münster @-@ West .
driving on the fe@@ eder close to the fe@@ eder the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days extends the back@@ stage to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous watch on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler road .
from here the traffic will only be logged on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be returned from a three @-@ thir@@ teen years ago .
the reason : static calculations had result that the bridge does not have the required power to absor@@ b especially the sever@@ ance of heavy traffic .
&quot; how long this bot@@ @-@ pass and the connected St@@ au is going to last , the competent state can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , it is possible to count on years : for the bridge has an official remaining duration up to the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal li@@ abil@@ istic period , the state @-@ operation has chosen the limited time spent in the school holidays because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic is guided through the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural events for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the Theater@@ piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the young theatre are now planning a music project .
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with migration and refuge@@ e background , cultural institutions in Münster to visit . &quot;

in the context of the association N@@ ima &apos;s initiated &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the st@@ aging in the little house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with migration and refuge@@ e background , in schools with welcome classes the possibility of visiting this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most young people of the class will be between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and spoke little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the ch@@ oreo@@ graphic , the s@@ zen@@ ical images and video animations be it possible to follow the action on nonetheless , so the press release of the Young The@@ aters Münster . &quot;

the weather has made the star ri@@ pping Gu@@ ck@@ ers in the southwest of Germany at night for Friday a stroke of the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was suitable because of clouds and rain poor@@ ly suited to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory of Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we see many star@@ ters in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ters are pers@@ ei@@ des , which belong with 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour to the fastest ast@@ ri@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; their name have them , because they apparently come from the constell@@ ation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for ins@@ om@@ nia
&quot; in the evening you are etern@@ ally around , at night it is st@@ un@@ da@@ w@@ ah w@@ ah , in the morning is not far before the w@@ eck@@ er@@ kl@@ ing@@ eln no longer think about sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , it is possible with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sle@@ e@@ eding ?
&quot; there are several forms of ins@@ om@@ nia , and there can be many causes underlying , stres@@ ses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ed , Managing Director of the German Society for Sleeping Research and Sleeping . &quot;
&quot; what you understand land@@ line , but is the in@@ som@@ never , i.e. an input and a sleeping @-@ out disorder . &quot;
&quot; right now , many people tend to find themselves as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ir@@ cht , Deputy member of the German household association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind bed@@ bugs ?
the causes of ins@@ om@@ nia are complex .
&quot; behind it can organic , psych@@ ic or wast@@ ew@@ ater @-@ related factors , but also medicines are stuck . &quot;
not rarely is the disorder expres@@ sive an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is common especially with depression often , &quot; says We@@ ed . &quot;
and it can be that different factors asser@@ t each other .
&quot; who has , for example has a Band@@ shell , can bet bad , w@@ acht every two to three hours and starts bl@@ ur@@ ably , over all @-@ day problems and care to greet , there we@@ eds an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to strain , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
from when to do with sleeping disorders for the doctor ?
&quot; who is not well as@@ le@@ ep for a period of a month at least three nights a week and on the day is affected , should be directed to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; imp@@ air@@ ment can be quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ plug@@ ged , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is slightly irrit@@ able , has voting fluctu@@ ations or bodily disorders such as stomach or he@@ ada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; to all@@ evi@@ ate the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , a cog@@ nitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping @-@ coated only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ sight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; low @-@ approved sleeping medi@@ cs are available in Germany , with Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary dormitory of the Char@@ ité University of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should look at sleeping problems at first at the home@@ opath@@ ic , betra@@ ying white . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied by exam@@ inations if the problems have a physical cause .
who should in sleep labor and what happens here ?
&quot; for example , for the examination of sleeping laboratories , for example in snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory disorders , in case of disease and if one does not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; actually , you do not need to prepare for the study . &quot;
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch sheep , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the c@@ lock@@ wise one goes to bed to his normal time .
&quot; besides the electro@@ des in the body , one carries a Nas@@ en@@ br@@ ille , a chest strap and a bo@@ ast at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping room . &quot;
how can those affected the problems get a handle ?
there are quite a lot of foot@@ screws where you can sleep for better sleep .
&quot; it counts on : regular sleeping and lifts , not too long in bed can not sleep , not far from sleeping , alcohol , and at night will not look at the clock - then you start to count immediately , and that is not at all condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German swim@@ mer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has vo@@ iced by Facebook to the dis@@ appoint@@ ing of the D@@ SV team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he had fet@@ ched gold at the short @-@ world championship in Doha and presented at the same time his first world record .
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler faces the latest ex @-@ team members in the cri@@ tique of the ex @-@ team members .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ asi@@ eger 20.000 € award and a jungle kö@@ nig 15@@ 0.000 € should no one be wonder@@ ing about missing medals , &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on Friday at his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls , however very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot , and do not operate so closely with the subject matter , or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls will be adjusted , &quot; he stated . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , would have had to be reported first nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ doping agency Germany ( N@@ ada ) . &quot;
it is precisely how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who can not be controlled a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent controllers of W@@ ada / fin@@ a , must not participate , &quot; &quot; demands of the choice of Hamburg , which now operates a ice cream . &quot;
airport : ban@@ de by Bag@@ h@@ eben
professional di@@ ers at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; at the age of 50 and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years , the police took place in the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the in@@ di@@ gesti@@ ble had committed as a ban@@ de several ash@@ - and bag @-@ ste@@ els .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 p.m. the civilian officials realized in the area of the airport in Düsseldorf , a gang that was known for the polic@@ emen from past theft . &quot;
the two women and two men had committed several delicacies since the mid July of this year and were very professional .
&quot; the specialists of crime against criminal off@@ ences , the specialists of criminal off@@ ences were to be followed by criminal off@@ spring to Germany , four acts . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they had a total of over 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; alt@@ built , a few Lin@@ den@@ b@@ äum@@ chen , a few l@@ oth@@ ills , inter@@ mitt@@ edly , the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ peaceful sh@@ ain works on the first sight not so , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walk along the road from east to west , one arrives at play@@ grounds , a refreshing nur@@ sery and a bi@@ ol@@ ates . &quot;
on the façade of a gray house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; opposite to a Li@@ dl , which should be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; trendy part &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate firm peac@@ em@@ ain are called in the last weeks however preferred with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the residents have hired lodging , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and used for events . &quot;
especially the Berlin Inter@@ sen@@ ator H@@ enkel had been several times for the beginning of the year several times for a hard drive of police against the project to be the &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonom@@ ous violence .
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ for@@ ge had been vac@@ ated with 300 polic@@ emen , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams wag@@ ons on site , sper@@ r@@ te parts of the road and held visitors from the house to enter the house with number 94 . &quot;
currency of its renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown domestic land@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July a Berlin Board of Directors was decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others are talking about pre@@ dat@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left force is not the main or@@ ge of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer who lived since 1999 in the pin@@ z , and Jana * that runs here three children especially from the police section . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the home projects they share the concern of rising supplements and g@@ entri@@ fication .
&quot; it does not sound according to a p@@ aci@@ z , which affects himself from multi@@ pl@@ ish@@ y pl@@ aster in front of the left &apos;s left . &quot;
the dit@@ ch that enter the Berlin interior and the police between domestic and their neighbours does not exist .
&quot; the peaceful workers &quot; district in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which also has a lower average pace today as compared to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; also house land@@ ings , and the bor@@ ns of this family @-@ projects are long occupied for a long time ago : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the whole Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under great police , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and partly inhabited today by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly to the mag@@ net for tourists and el@@ ectoral liner from all over the world : with them now supporters of the GDR and former landlord will share their p@@ ines . &quot;
this also has been noticeable in the Rent which has grown almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them on st@@ owed discs or fresh painted fac@@ ades which were rejected with color .
&quot; no other street was mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neighbours can be seen as a problem , be that it is not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : criminal off@@ ences such as body infringement are consequently almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
the most important part of the criminal off@@ ences make experts more likely to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the contro@@ versi@@ al 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; concerning violence , it is descrip@@ tive : people in the 94 are their neighbours , which may not be determined . &quot;
even the famous fl@@ amm@@ able cars give it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er even longer .
&quot; for the studied architecture , her street is not a crime point , on the contrary , &quot; &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliber@@ ately moved into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and stayed .
&quot; therefore , it was also so important that the inhabitants left their street : from the police , politics and the media , that all suddenly blame the interpretation of the district in July all suddenly . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road will still be taken away : through a secure re@@ building of the former buildings , which over@@ ride the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are indeed con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well preserved , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I be absolutely not thei@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; but what should you do , if any one never listen to someone ? &quot;
there is fru@@ stration on all sides as well as in the police and the residents .
&quot; for tu@@ f@@ lown , who like about colour bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house @-@ projects and the left scene belon@@ ged to the pine . &quot;
&quot; who draws , it should be aware - just like somebody who can complain into a pub . &quot;
all persons presented only with pres@@ en@@ ame persons shall not be asked to be called by their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organizer .
&quot; besides , she is a social @-@ worker on the spot . &quot;
since July is Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le the refuge@@ e officers for Ur@@ bach .
the social pe@@ dagog@@ ical team supports the team of management at Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact for all players : refugees , working group refuge@@ e assistance , authorities , authorities and who else is still mis@@ understood . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine client from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le now is , the ei@@ gh@@ ing Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less sp@@ spot@@ ted as rather on the variety of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; sear@@ ched for a administration force with a talent for languages and people , associated with many years of experience in the field of social work , just a super@@ ficial Woll@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; administrative work is not its central area , suppose Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as networks . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place on three years with the possibility of extension .
&quot; it was highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le ehr@@ en- and full @-@ full actors supports . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organisational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
new containers in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
&quot; a serious problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for the conn@@ ect@@ arians who have been acknowledged . &quot;
for the connection @-@ application the municipalities are responsible .
you must accommodate refugees in own or rented homes .
&quot; the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself . &quot;
the responsibility is variable from the coun@@ cils on Commun@@ e and J@@ ob@@ center .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord will offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for quite a while .
de facto the management takes no private apartments .
&quot; so far it has not been doing so far , be dependent on private apartments , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the apartments must be re@@ produced , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will soon be placed in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; apart from a firm B@@ lei@@ gh there are trainees , educational sites , training courses , One @-@ euro jobs and out activities for refugees and migrants , have to be established or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help Hau@@ ling master , do non @-@ profit work - and the motiv@@ ates and very or@@ derly , such as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive overall impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not work just work .
&quot; the day usable a solid structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop an en@@ force .
&quot; so , there are offers like sports , contacts with local people and especially Spanish courses . &quot;
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so also here administration and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain the refugees that it will just take and take the time to be useful , for example , with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach nobody would not work , nor be tun@@ nels that will never be integrated . &quot;
the significant majority would be motivated .
&quot; however , however , there is also , says customer honest@@ ly , &quot; people , with whom nothing goes . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two after the recent occurr@@ ences are fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; what would call be nai@@ ve to name &quot; &quot; a res@@ tr@@ is@@ iko and would not want to ex@@ clude them . &quot;
&quot; sensitive , the hel@@ pers are already familiar . &quot;
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely into call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , the main - and volunteers have to hold on site and in the region according to its activities . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they always have in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; this question is clear to answer , neither is the policy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees who would relax the situation .
&quot; Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher also makes it out , so that the human beings are negoti@@ able to integrate it up to date . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people in need are , m@@ ould you help them , both women are united . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complex , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : em@@ bro@@ ker with hel@@ icopter
