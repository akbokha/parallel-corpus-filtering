<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and to prevent the Trade Agreement TTP - this want to both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"moreover, the two US presidential competition are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The report on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt more small and warned of how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to put the economy to death and regulating death," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, it would be quite different, claims turmp."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively return regulators, and he makes himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax-treasures strong - for individuals and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton against it says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged opportunities and need money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes would increase for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the mnuts will be invested, say Trump and Clinton almost worm."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants still announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly refused by the state-wars of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Trump thus they could not be party for internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">More clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power stations and uplift coal production in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas that wants to cancel the Treaty of mitigation Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"on the contrary, Clinton wants to strengthen and calls for the renewable energies in their investment program:" "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpaziet trade agreements, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US do not want to isolate from international trade - but simply protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"these should be paid even better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump will do in this question is not quite clear: once, he says: the minimum wage must be rally, then he says he will not be altered."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand stands Trump, which wants to boost the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold him before, so the budgetary would only be even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton, who want to demand at least by the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="14">"she is a department of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fleed.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Münchner north in one of the few decentralized shelters for women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs set up the institution with Pro Familia and the Münchner Women's Aid.</seg>

<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has done on her escape experience with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="30">"who believe that the end as soon as they were in Germany, earre, tells."</seg>
<seg id="31">Also here the women in refugee accommodations are often considered as a minderwery and the worst event.</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 percent of women that live in Münchner north, traumatized, appreciates them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so normal that they don't say anything.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they are not afraid to speak openly about the experiences, because the sheep is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they are often not helping to help wifists, you need more accommodations only for them, calling."</seg>
<seg id="37">The seven district governments in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question, whether from a similar project like in Munich, in its jurisdiction, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there are so something in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Schwaben are not separated alone women alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesperson of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Unter- and mittelfranken there are some common accommodations or houses only for all-related women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study which was published to the committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or will find men and women together, it can come to - continuous - violence against women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of aliens"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but as Vladimir Putin his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of St. Petersburger Palastes in reception, I can not rebate myself that Ankara wants to reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the envelope, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin in smiles, carallible and he can hardly ry warmth, even for his reserved relationships."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count it.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day I described a newspaper that Erdogan had heard that Erdogan, as would never be something worst."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me the enthusiasm of enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin showed radiant, sustainable coolness showed that the State of Russia had forgotten anything."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downcast of a Russian struggle on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow in response to time was vutentment.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to like Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger because it was committed by a allegedly friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">"it's going to rebuild it again, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media led a fierce unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">"once it seemed, the Turks seemed to bear the Turks for everything to blame."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most importantly were the allegations of senior officials, that Erdogan has benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamist state."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it is time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erdogan received the excuse that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are clearly obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan needs all friends, which he can get, after spending last month at a failed state of almost his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is gone by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia travel agency and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a delay in the Tower of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week predicted the state remotely cheap fruits and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formed it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West since it considers its reaction to the tried of power over a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the ongoing Groll come about the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike on it is to pull out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara with certainty, the Russian state of states won a bonus that he called for the state-rich support for the elected state organe."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-made for Moscow, a self-comprehension, which itself has a profound fear of rain-change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this amazing palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one, as it was an analysts once described," "Alliance of aliens" ": two countries that treat themselves from the West and are now poorly treated."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference in Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey are opposing sites."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be granted, that after nearly three hours of first discussions on press conference, they said that they would not even have stopped the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey resed it on a question of their differences while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a perfect dispute as the NATO member of Turkey's Russian martial arts - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will speak at least one another.</seg>

<seg id="11">"de Maizière, after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, has sent a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But they fall into the wider range.</seg>

<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of memorial for example - raises the question: what does that actually have to do with certainty and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be in speech that the attacks were made by Ansbach and Würzburg refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "moreover, many people in the face of the high refugee are concerned about security."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men medium age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you assign the commenteen parts to overlay it under the pseudonym non-inalienation of men with rust insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multipurpose of repentance is not to be found on a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the novelties of physical objects, but on Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all forks according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable chains."</seg>
<seg id="7">"there is also no hormone by hobbyists, it has an emotional meaning: older platter reserve their feelings more likely to spend (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it, alone time (69% vs. 66%)."</seg>
<seg id="8">But will the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a humble ascent and wild grading, my hands keep and a bit critily say as:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos slowly goes to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller were arranged - there are still a handful of fantastic tables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman, shut the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and vegetables by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle ages, a woman, presumably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector that I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already cherish," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have approx. 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these sound plates, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by his home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy plates, which he could not afford to buy them when they were previously released, when he was young and bankrupt."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things that I buy are from the late 60s, early 70ies, which appeared, when I had 11 or 12. things, when I was probably something to buy them, to buy them," "says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who purchase plates, more introverted and eager to spend their time, and adds:" I do not smoke and I drink not very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my veraster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meets Yougov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard of the Medienhpe people who have heard about the comeback, and let yourself be seen again to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"by the conversations that I have led, people usually have chosen about 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to a trailer of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the innate emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a business like phonica, in order to recognize that record stores a soothing community of pargestures."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to draw back to the stability of familiar sound-platform from objects that weak itentices.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the posal possessions as a kind of comfort," "says WEZ."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" "a staff of a record-stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought this month a record, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey took also out that 41% have a record player that they never use, during 7% of those who buy a record, no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the report, I would probably look very worried while I was shining through a stacks of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle ages), has noticed a" trophy "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently came here purely and said," I do not say a record player, but I would like to buy a radio record record so that I can put them into the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"producing more products, less musiklastically."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no turntable. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older that are only slowly pure."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stop, that has dedicated to the muff almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I reproduce."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women aged middle aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat more relaxed than in the above-standing shops - Wild Beads neuester Synthesizer and sextted pop instead of experimental jazz, from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them sees mourky, but brand mental traumata are hard to imagine if you are long next to someone over 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variation of the plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is rather a mannequins as a large shopping cart.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore, the collector of records is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from one computer or in another way, but the beauty of plates is..." it drives along with a degrated sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, from which is said that a new generation of record owners is to have inspired: urban outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the onshine, the jeans-Hotpants to patterns, could be grouped by a group of young teenager before a father and his daughter to remember, a crosley turntable to buy."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees her - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "turnart."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my post-ups take, that the results of YouGov vote, let them, at least in record business in Soho, the great number of female collector's and record lovers that exist in reality, record business and in Onlinefores, unconsidered."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty with security out of record stores of Berwick Street and leaves through plates, while they die the starring of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator, who dominates the shoulders of middle ages."</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling-resistant and inescapable of a rapid staggering between competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the olympic torch itself is a burning rod, from the wristband to protect the turner to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not turn on the TV, read a paper or listen to a conversation of your neighbours in the queue, without over Simone Biles, Katie Leafy or the battle between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warm with dimples, would definitely have been sent with this known name that could be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertisement if he would be a swimmer, gymnasts or even feasts."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline around gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminated any event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports which are not generally accepted: air pistol, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always swim the chest and may reign it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I might make humble arguments for my particular darling, then let me direct the attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has already been a olympic event since 2000 it had been in Sydney it was said, it was the last 16 years so pointed out that many the I asked, did not know that it is at all an Olympasportart."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA saw athletes on competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had made a Athlete to the end of 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on the trampoline has a certain aliens, partly because it sounds for an uncontaminated ear-proof for a clownschool than those for the Olympic Games sounds."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a redeemed enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous citations of his never to end-benevolous tremalls - but also the refinement of the gym and diving, which are two sports which are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "Trampoline" "dates from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling moves (turning, Have and salts) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are evaluated according to the official Olympiapologram after execution, difficulty and" flight time. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"secondary athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are in Rio against each other."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Medal must continue in their quest for gold further, faster, upwards and over, sometimes until the end, sometimes go back and back, up and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only apply the pork or the output, but also in the television transfer there is another well-known target: the world or the Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to raise even a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think about having this games than a bit tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of which the trampoline offers an atreprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">A backward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prallt from, apparently heelos like an astronaut, goes down, then downwards, then effortlessly back upwards."</seg>
<seg id="34">"even here there is a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no curbs in the distance, only the trastical, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and dudes of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will shine over the end as part of a afternoon blocks on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of Olympia-manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably be overlooked at the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">If the thread of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the objection of masculine Athlete - as it smote the male US turner according to The Wall Street Journal recently. Mr Dooley expects his to air rince; new fanclub.</seg>

<seg id="11">"in the orbit of well-being videos about protests, which probably come from the last or beginning of this year, show how security loot young people merge with staves, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority on Human Rights is now asking for a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to maintain this country and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is much appreciated by Nigeria the most populous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians, to fight terrorist attack over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get as much western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new pendent place in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>

<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or pushed into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet this could change.</seg>

<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists, such as the Oromo-liberating front or the National Liberation of the Ogaden, who were more or less forced in recent years to arming the turbulence."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitterness after years of the end of a guard under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media as cheap smartphones have been more frequently used and improved the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet-proxies that hide from where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave that they gathered themselves to protest themselves.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnies in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons of prosperous the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly in the Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they are the Oromos exploited, of which many Muslims are and live in flat regions."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing exactly.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which are about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former vine leader, was until his death on a non-councils made in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think of corners."</seg>

<seg id="45">"the present regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analysis. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively unclear reasons to assume the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"different from the Lord Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Serbia, Mr. Hailemariam from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services rendered by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more blood shed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had lived a rebellion in 2005, after thousands of elections protested according to analyst, according to the analyses of analyst, and subsequently stolen from the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raid, many protest were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "development experts" "Ethiopian leaders for their visionary Infrastructure planning, as the new pendent train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intention of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month of attacked in gondar, an amhoical city, of Tigray-held shops and the hatred towards the Tigray in social media."</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-hay usually occur only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland comes only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"fragments of the Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic on the bottom of the North Atlantic in an hour, it is at the average of 1,220 meters far."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five meters long animal up at satte 2.6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a robot."</seg>
<seg id="9">But this of longitude of lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science "at least of a Greenland-shark at the age of 392.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Schcontrolllein by Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this way of life, which means for spinal animals a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"though, the evolution of evolution has long been known that Greenland-hay are being painted."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-haie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the skinny coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive at the surface mostly only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenland researchers know researchers according to little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your Zeitlupempo maze them when they used six animals in front of six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">"booty make this sharks anyway: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remnants of a robot, another had the orthodontic of a young icebergs."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly it sleeves sleepy animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for Kadaver that torments from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland-hay, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Grönland or Spitsbergen, from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 inches long while the largest 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, analysed it with the carbon-14 method the ruler of the hair."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelet is already created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lincycleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as a nuclear-proliferation in the atmosphere of this radioactive carbon."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in which with 220 centimeters length of the smallest animal contained the lens against against it a low overshot of carbon-14 from the nuclear wafer, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Grönland hares in their lens against normal carbon-14 quantities that arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimeters long Grönlandhai became an age of 335 years, during the record-shark with 502 centimeters even 392 years old might be."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-females only get descendants until they are longer than four metres, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers in the length could be assigned to an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years ago, Greenland-hay is obviously at least one and a half-centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this may be for spinal fluids at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme mainly live in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record fixtures, a 211 years old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck a 120 years old Harpoenspitze was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures often the body of the animals live there on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">They are mature later - and alted slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"to warm water up in cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"for the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal heat bursts."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on it, as soon as possible as many descendants as possible, explains the evolution of evolution."</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should rather invest in a long life on the other hand.</seg>

<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory for four years ago, while Hoy had the fifth of six Olympiad medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"she reiterated the trick, after they took place in March at the Bahn World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Hoys only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Andrier Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as those of the emerging.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retiring made a gap that kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man who remained with whom they saw, when they saw potential in the villi, which has now unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny - who made four years ago with Hoy triumphed - and Skinner played a Olympic stadium in the qualifying rounds, but in the standardised of the New Year in the first lap."</seg>

<seg id="14">"Hoy saw from his position as an BBC expert, and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they came to the pedestal."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make my name a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the end we put up a Olympiarekord and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph 2012 at the page Kennys and Hoys there was Hindes that he fell on the railway after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned to this statement later and there was no objection of England.</seg>

<seg id="44">The GB team leaves itself on its strong train team to dominate the medium period of Olympic Games and to pick a char of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio was rundown."</seg>
<seg id="46">"it played in the background, as the resignation of the technical guidance Shane Sutton in April within the middle of Sexismus- and Mobbingvores, as well as retiring of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you are eternally around, at night it is stundawah wah, in the morning is not far before the weckerklingeln no longer think about sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, it is possible with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleeeding?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of insomnia, and there can be many causes underlying, stresses Hans-Günter Weed, Managing Director of the German Society for Sleeping Research and Sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand landline, but is the insomnever, i.e. an input and a sleeping-out disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"right now, many people tend to find themselves as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenkircht, Deputy member of the German household association with practice in the Anglo-Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind bedbugs?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of insomnia are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can organic, psychic or wastewater-related factors, but also medicines are stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the disorder expressive an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common especially with depression often," says Weed. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors assert each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who has, for example has a Bandshell, can bet bad, wacht every two to three hours and starts blurably, over all-day problems and care to greet, there weeds an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to strain, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">From when to do with sleeping disorders for the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who is not well asleep for a period of a month at least three nights a week and on the day is affected, should be directed to the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can be quite different: one is downcast, tired, unplugged, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has voting fluctuations or bodily disorders such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options include behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping-coated only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - insighted."</seg>
<seg id="22">"low-approved sleeping medics are available in Germany, with Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary dormitory of the Charité University of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, one should look at sleeping problems at first at the homeopathic, betraying white."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examinations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should in sleep labor and what happens here?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, for the examination of sleeping laboratories, for example in snoring with respiratory disorders, in case of disease and if one does not find the cause of a sleepy disorder, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">"actually, you do not need to prepare for the study."</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a lunch sheep," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">After the clockwise one goes to bed to his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes in the body, one carries a Nasenbrille, a chest strap and a boast at the finger."</seg>

<seg id="21">This also has been noticeable in the Rent which has grown almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>

<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as networks."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place on three years with the possibility of extension.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was highest time," says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle ehren- and full-full actors supports. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for the connectarians who have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection-application the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accommodate refugees in own or rented homes.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is variable from the councils on Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord will offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the management takes no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far it has not been doing so far, be dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, the apartments must be reproduced, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"apart from a firm Bleigh there are trainees, educational sites, training courses, One-euro jobs and out activities for refugees and migrants, have to be established or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building or help Hauling master, do non-profit work - and the motivates and very orderly, such as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive overall impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not work just work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day usable a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop an enforce.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, there are offers like sports, contacts with local people and especially Spanish courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain the refugees that it will just take and take the time to be useful, for example, with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach nobody would not work, nor be tunnels that will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority would be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, however, there is also, says customer honestly," people, with whom nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two after the recent occurrences are fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer very clearly, "what would call be naive to name" "a restrisiko and would not want to exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">"sensitive, the helpers are already familiar."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely into call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, the main - and volunteers have to hold on site and in the region according to its activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they always have in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"this question is clear to answer, neither is the policy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees who would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbacher also makes it out, so that the human beings are negotiable to integrate it up to date."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people in need are, mould you help them, both women are united."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complex, there are no simple answers."</seg>
