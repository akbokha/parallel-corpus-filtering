Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as regarding Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
&quot; but during this meeting , it should also be a conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years now .
Washington critic@@ ises the long @-@ term settl@@ ers of Israel and thro@@ ws the Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of action in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal of the death deal on the Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship of the two further worse has deter@@ ior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had been held a contro@@ versi@@ al speech at the invitation of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , in front of the US Congress , which was formerly used as aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
in a state of emergency professor he created his girlfriend
&quot; in a not@@ ary , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on &apos;s voice of the police he told his girlfriend and that his officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; , &quot; but still live and probably be excited , and he said , the family contacts of dead women could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house the officials found the ly@@ che of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was running on a white block , I loved it , I loved it , I loved myself , I loved myself . this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by himself . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississippi River , already 300 miles for school grounds , E@@ than Schmidt has shot at the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Pol@@ es Bu@@ ford Bu@@ ford said that University employees have heard the sl@@ ate at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he has made the fat@@ eful not@@ ation at some point after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took his life when the police took him .
&quot; a day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what &apos;s most motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
they said that they are looking forward to their teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have history of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
Schmidt himself was not mentioned in a written book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
&quot; both wel@@ ded in the department of social sciences and history , whose privileged position 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some prophec@@ ies to problem@@ ati@@ cal behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , he said , he also seemed a little up@@ set and ed@@ gy , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that the lam@@ b told him that he had at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
he had previously asked the Delta State University to be asked for a state of health reasons and said that he have any health problem .
in this year he only set two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the University &apos;s employment policy meant that the Promotion , for which he has worked so hard for him to represent no guarantee of an automatic way to a position as a Assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; University William La@@ For@@ ge said , he did not know anything from a conflict between he and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s conception . &quot;
these are questions that &apos;s no longer answer .
&quot; after the flight from the Campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs lane , when he was back into Mississippi from Ark@@ ans@@ as imports . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , un@@ anim@@ ate himself self with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber Pist@@ ole in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ inth meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the driv@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b said to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
he grew up in the area .
&quot; he &apos;s work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pe@@ dagog@@ y . &quot;
he has taken his doctor@@ ate in spring in pe@@ dagog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs wonder@@ ed him as intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and Lamb was 20 , when she met through mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach the guitar game for some years . &quot;
he was at the time of the wom@@ b .
&quot; all girls sh@@ mol@@ ten thi@@ ther , when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson city of fire . &quot;
he &apos;s and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously quite some time together .
&quot; he said in the emergency , &quot; I did die my wife , but there was no judgment of a marriage . &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick building that is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband by Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they were left 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
he &apos;s met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both in a summer months ago .
later they played together the one or the other G@@ ig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer and a Jewish coordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time , his guitar and harmon@@ ic game ended over a sp@@ inal audience . &quot;
&quot; there were no signs for it , that anything may not be un@@ anim@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were on au@@ fr@@ aming and a talk together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , they both had a good sense for j@@ okes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester programme and specialized in American n@@ atives and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at Em@@ por@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Br@@ otherhood and University of the Committee .
&quot; on the Delta State Campus in C@@ lev@@ eland , on Tuesday evening , about 900 people , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle party . &quot;

this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from C@@ lev@@ eland and Mississippi .
&quot; associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans in this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to conf@@ lic@@ ed that the police now says , after he was on the emergency , and that Lamb in his emergency ad@@ mitt@@ edly referred to as his wife , but there is no indication of it that the two ever married . &quot;

&quot; back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also not@@ able for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als and I remark that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; back in Time . &quot;

&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon says , its response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support to Syria : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution for the nearly five years of continuous conflict , and more weapons will only squ@@ ash@@ ing violence and mis@@ ery for millions of men . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss again demands all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said a press conference in Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the Annual General meeting in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he de@@ pl@@ ores that the revol@@ ving in the Council and within the Syrian people and the Regional powers shall make this situation un@@ solu@@ ble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called for five permanent members to face the crisis in Syria to show the same solidarity and unity which they have proven in achieving a nuclear hol@@ ocaust on Iran . &quot;
8 re@@ fr@@ values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a break .
&quot; however , no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks of surveys down , it has not yet worked . &quot;
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in a two @-@ digit area and some begin to ask yourself what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate counter .
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the el@@ ectoral period . &quot;
no claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the rep@@ ublic@@ s nom@@ ination .
&quot; empha@@ size that at that time in 2011 R@@ ick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership has been released to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of them won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have a general choice to fight .
&quot; but outside groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC , and the conservative @-@ group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s stamina and start to exp@@ ose their dollars to overthrow him . &quot;
here are some current conver@@ sions that indicate that the Real Estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary stage :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ da@@ cy in mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
until mid July there were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in early states .
Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say , they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; Ben Car@@ son makes approximately the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; &quot; loved &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same over Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees the temper@@ ament &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and Belgian testim@@ onies , believe 52 percent of the basic Irish el@@ ectors believe that the real temper@@ ament is the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first for@@ age of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think he &apos;s personality for one over@@ lap , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent , that he did not have the personality to be able to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 could say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / Post . &quot;
rep@@ ublic@@ s voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they set off their funds , we rep@@ ublic@@ a voters Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who adverti@@ sed the GO@@ P Nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July they took their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P el@@ ectors in the past did not have the clear@@ est cryst@@ all@@ ball .
at this time last cycle had four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans that R@@ ick Perry the nom@@ ination would win over only 28 % for the final Candi@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a multitude of GO@@ P @-@ voters Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign can be viewed as pl@@ au@@ si@@ bel . &quot;
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still nearly every . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp &apos;s majority supports . &quot;
&quot; he has two points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , in front of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , prior to J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally from the edge of Paul , John Ka@@ ther and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who is propos@@ ing him ?
Ben Car@@ son would collect the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a cr@@ ack majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans says that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters , the Tru@@ mp support they say that they have been able to forgive her voice . &quot;
&quot; of course , it can happen much to change this , and no one can truly say that never mind the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters that they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign was released two months ago from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ h &quot; , &quot; the immigration and fishing point was in public dis@@ course . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tru@@ mp will hold decisive H@@ isp@@ ano US from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re @-@ oriented efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they are in with Tru@@ mp in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as long as immigration in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tru@@ mp will seem to do . &quot;
the fru@@ stration on the government clim@@ bed up to new high@@ s .
&quot; at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile takes around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new assembly survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry in Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa faced two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have been frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; car@@ ved . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive sh@@ ame@@ works in Germany

&quot; on Sy@@ lt is the offer of objects natural , in particular , it is stated in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study reveals , in which special shell is one square meter most cost . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ ck in Munich are not really little . &quot;
in contrast to Germany top @-@ locations there is one of the prizes as pe@@ anu@@ ts .
the real estate provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has released a rank@@ ings of the most exclusive German work@@ places - with square @-@ prices in snow@@ ing heights .
&quot; some ten thousand Euros are ni@@ x - per square meter , aff@@ lu@@ ent . &quot;

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Trau@@ m@@ start thanks to Müller and i@@ dol
two @-@ maker tor@@ ch in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just running a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller on the way to a con@@ den@@ sed 3 : 0 on Olympi@@ ak@@ os Piraeus - then ran out .
a sover@@ eign of champ@@ ions of the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario id@@ ols have covered a dream start to FC Bayern in H@@ ex@@ enk@@ essel by Piraeus a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola won their pr@@ el@@ ude in the Champions League at the Champions League at the Champions League at the Greek record A@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ols hit ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth launch of the series is intended to take the first step towards the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich on 28 May 2016 .
Müller received the Champions League of Bavaria &apos;s Champions League at the Champions League for Bavaria guidance from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto which caused one as a sl@@ ender shot of the world &apos;s master@@ y .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , had promised Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp le@@ ah@@ m before the game at the Kar@@ ak@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 688 . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated vision with no to shine .
&quot; Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the König@@ s@@ class , including rep@@ utable clubs like Manchester United , Sp@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ ageous , in their off@@ ensi@@ tive efforts , but often to lay un@@ preced@@ ented . &quot;
the attacks were too often crossed by play@@ m@@ ation on Link@@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa rec@@ t that rarely crossed against the former wick Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
&quot; Müller on the right hand , right more luck , than his side stri@@ pe from the right h@@ emisph@@ ere in the left upper case . &quot;
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , called the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ stor@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown the head @-@ ball of the Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
then by direct acceptance the go@@ alie Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although Bavaria had been used as a normal game could re@@ tire re@@ con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous .
in the case of Tor@@ tu@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was a conc@@ e@@ word .
&quot; about , as he had a shot of ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te side ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
in front of Neu@@ er guar@@ ola left a square with David Al@@ aba in the centre beside Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
&quot; Mario id@@ ol@@ e , after mus@@ cular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat out above . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero started only after the final training green light , said Sport@@ sman Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it that is already vi@@ cious . &quot;
also during the first change guar@@ di@@ ola decided against him as he placed King@@ sl@@ ey Com@@ an for the ancient Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
&quot; i@@ dol was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ metres he put a third on . &quot;
in front of the game it was at the stadium in Kra@@ w@@ alle .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly ref@@ used Bavaria fans in their audience , the followers of Host@@ s had re@@ bell@@ ished Piraeus with words and ges@@ tures , attacked the security forces , and went with keywords against the Mün@@ ch@@ ner trailer . &quot;
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was off@@ ended from the stadium .
&quot; he smo@@ ked , has a higher risk to lose teeth
&quot; he smo@@ ked them not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this places a Pots@@ da@@ mer long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : the risk decreases the risk quickly .
smo@@ kers have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this goes out from the long @-@ term study of international research teams , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smoking , smoking is the risk to losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely , in order to make the 2,5@@ - up to 3.3 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had been watching more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major contribut@@ ors for tooth decay be car@@ ies and infl@@ amm@@ ation of the g@@ ing@@ iv@@ ey , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking a risk factor is stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental care is therefore going to be leading to frequent g@@ ums of car@@ vers .
not clari@@ fying to what extent is smoking also the risk to tooth decay increases .
&quot; people who have stopped using smoking could their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; however , it could last over ten years until the threat goes back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; first author Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English university Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; man must convince people of them , non @-@ smoking , &quot; &quot; said Mr. H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking , the lifetime of life . &quot;
not too smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge also to a good dental health even to the high age .
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 per cent of the population affected by 14 to 74 years of dental surgery , the DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth decay .
the new long @-@ term study starts the findings .

EU @-@ Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the intensi@@ fication of the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a large reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the contro@@ versi@@ al private sphere of jurisdiction for disputes between affiliated and states should therefore be loos@@ ened by a transparent system , which corresponds significantly more traditional dishes in his work@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens seek , &quot; stated the official EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Sweden has to introduce the proposal to a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade agreements with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; in TTIP , the largest free trade area of the world is to develop with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings have been instru@@ mental in particular , that the EU states and the USA can jointly select independent judges for a new investment Court . &quot;
&quot; they are supposed to come from the EU , the United States and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to raise against judgment .
&quot; so far , the procedures involved took each other on a refer@@ ee , an obj@@ ection to which the jud@@ g@@ ments were not . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months has become clear that citizens from the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fairness and justice does not trust , Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work according to its own data on an International Investment Court . &quot;
there could be an example not to be clari@@ fied between Chinese companies and EU states for example .
the investor @-@ state @-@ state arbit@@ rators required mainly of large @-@ concerts ( IS@@ DS ) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed by oppos@@ ing opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ectoral campa@@ ign@@ ing , to manage the company poll@@ ut@@ ants , national laws , or reduce consumer protection and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first opinions of anti @-@ TTIP , such as Camp@@ act received the proposals by the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; critic@@ ised , notably that they are not intended to apply for the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) . &quot;
the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) describes the plans on the other hand as big progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered essential points out at the reform of essential points , the Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration shall be of the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European corporation of B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE war@@ ned that the economy of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by it .
when the talks on TTIP TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded on Wednesday until further .
the negotiations run since mid 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was already at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer considered to be un@@ sustainable .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s debut in the issue of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s was expected by the frag@@ rant of the Prime Minister &apos;s Prime Minister with voltage
the new Labour Office of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n shall give his debut on the issue of the Prime Minister and to lay down with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be raised to ask for the first of his six questions shortly after noon and his performance by the media is likely to be tested by the S &amp; D Group .
he called for &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p a few sessions to leave them to their colleague .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ et and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the decision of the Labour Day on Tuesday during the Sin@@ ite dyn@@ asty , during a memorial party to commemor@@ ate the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ising criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs , and is at the heart of several title @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s decision to sing not the National hy@@ m@@ n to sing draws attention to itself
&quot; a spok@@ es@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he could &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence and he had the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told by the BBC Two News@@ night program , he got to sing the Labour president to sing the national anth@@ ems , &quot; regardless of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have consec@@ rated to serve in Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s peak team and refer to differences in the economy , defense and foreign affairs , whereas less than a sixth of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary party was originally a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says , that political differences become st@@ acking also within the Labour Party and by Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s statements on the position of the European Union and the limit for Win . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour can put on a whole to remove all the idea of a limitation .
&quot; ( hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of work@@ - and pensions Minister , that the Party is very clear to cut the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the 5th Labour Office , from David Cameron , since then he is a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the D@@ isp@@ atch Box . &quot;
&quot; the Labour Office that promised a different policy set , says he said &apos; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Isl@@ ington North MP said that the frag@@ ment of the Prime Minister has said to con@@ front@@ ational , and that he has under@@ min@@ ed both &quot; perc@@ ep@@ iness &quot; and the dispute with resist@@ ors and to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadows can be represented by him if he is not taking part - for example if Mr Cameron is on the go . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ co@@ w , the spok@@ es@@ man of the House , addressed to the issue . &quot;
&quot; as he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron told that he wants to move from politicians in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ par@@ le Theatre &quot; who often is linked to the frag@@ ment of the Prime Minister . but some years later , he ad@@ jour@@ ned that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; when she was first sent on TV in 1990 , the issue was argu@@ ed with Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the origin@@ ator and his leadership in the sub @-@ house and his position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics were argu@@ ed in a car@@ ic@@ ature and fur@@ row far@@ ther reforms . &quot;

between May and July the result was grown without bonuses in the United Kingdom at 2.8 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the fastest and in@@ sist@@ ence over the time of an interest rate .
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and has been clim@@ bed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ TSE 100 Index concluded with an increase by Red % at 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a leap of 20 % after the acquisition of ri@@ vals AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
&quot; this transaction would combine the two largest brewer@@ ies of the world and brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;

met@@ abolic - start @-@ up campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ do
met@@ abolic tries to protect Ig@@ A @-@ Fili@@ p in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ als have launched a shelf campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of an 700 million US $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di , the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia have prepared the early next year , to strengthen and Ig@@ A markets its relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by ma@@ instream @-@ marketing and marketing through the Social Media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ distributors and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer Sim@@ mo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop@@ ke@@ e@@ pers , the remaining tickets for the South Australian Football Association to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it will be expected to public@@ ise a further detail of its defensive strategy on 29 September , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices leads to its annual investor &apos;s strategy . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia are nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ shop stores and higher profits than Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ Network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; shop@@ pers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious and Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer holds much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia comparison to some 14 percent in the east countries . &quot;
&quot; however , analy@@ st such as Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will take away and all existing players , but mainly independently sel@@ ections . &quot;
a report published in this week report the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailers 360 $ million turnover per year and cash to lose 250 million US $ by the end of 2016 .
&quot; progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened twenty offices in SA and 30 in Germany , and will receive a turnover of 500 million US $ and 600 million in each market . &quot;
the loss in foodstuffs and grocery store and in the amounts of met@@ cas@@ hs high fixed @-@ based could only cost some 13 million US dollars before interest and taxes included , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time met@@ abolic market shares in the east countries , mainly to Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that Ig@@ A @-@ purchas@@ ers are the final . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley takes up that met@@ cas@@ hs sales in the foodstuffs and grocery store will be around 3,@@ 8 percent in 2016 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and increase the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10,@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ trials probably will likely van@@ ish within a decade . &quot;
cash @-@ cash regi@@ sters it to respond openly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a committee member has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As Market &apos;s share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from met@@ cas@@ hs foodstuffs and food trading companies , which is approximately 1.@@ 200 Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer , has been refl@@ ecting 43 percent since 2012 and refl@@ ecting the operating pressure on sales and mar@@ gins since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ alers sm@@ ates however and invested more than 150 million US $ , in order to deliver boats with CO@@ LES and wo@@ unded by hundreds of products every week , and Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer to improve their shops through fast growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private @-@ label food . &quot;
&quot; met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tations and loading programs to vig@@ or will be put to vig@@ or and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis club Steve Heal@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; within the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and earned after the president of the Australian tennis court Steve Heal@@ y rather praise to his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the youngest of the talented Du@@ os that is called again as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; gr@@ ated by the in@@ famous struggles of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ r@@ inka with the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator : &quot; W@@ aw@@ r@@ inka would have to kill K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; last seen as he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a Kr@@ amp@@ f was fail@@ ing a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is was defended by Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the contest behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals at the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I got pretty much ei@@ f@@ ere is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi has moved a little in the battle , &quot; &quot; Heal@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat , when he has broken down a bridge in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has bre@@ ached a bat from fru@@ stration and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has responded in the US Open extremely well , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think that he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe that he has been treated a little bit away . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he doesn &apos;t fit into the team and so on , he has never practi@@ sed a problem with the other players he is sh@@ attered . he is well in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision to take K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in the key pre@@ decision , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but it ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term component into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ verti@@ s , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick was done very quickly to understand what people like fe@@ ather and Mur@@ ray . he asc@@ ends in the eyes of the public , and he deserves to understand him . some time outside the r@@ amp , in which he can only pon@@ der him , I consider appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
European refuge@@ e crisis : Hungary explained not@@ e@@ ze the border , holding refugees back
&quot; Hungary explained the p@@ avilion , and ri@@ dden the south @-@ border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all firmly that tried to come illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered themselves in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials with rebel@@ lion . &quot;
people who have been f@@ lown away from violence is hidden for an unknown time in a land stri@@ pe on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built up tents and settled down there .
but fru@@ ity have been clim@@ bed .
&quot; as a police hel@@ icopter on them p@@ ending , sk@@ andi@@ zed the migrants &quot; Op@@ ens the border ! &quot; &quot; and cri@@ ed ins@@ ults against the Hungarian production @-@ policy . &quot;
some are returning from protest foods and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary while being more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ als .
&quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries will take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the hung@@ arian @-@ Ser@@ b border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a tough meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed upon to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were forced to refu@@ ge in Italy and Greece . they oppressed up their hopes that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would have reached another 120@@ .000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; in Hungary , however , his hopes were not able to enter any action from Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency was out@@ dated on Tuesday , in two southern regions , authorities gave more authority to tackle the crisis , so that they could reduce roads and asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also ends the construction of a bar@@ bed wi@@ red us along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it ends a fence at the Ser@@ b border .
&quot; CB@@ S News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons in the race , the bar@@ bed @-@ wire tor@@ n between Hungary and Serbia were introduced . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant increase in the Middle East from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Viktor Or@@ ban has existed , however , that most of the coming economic migrants are , who are looking for a better life , and no war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ us , which led the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher skins for de@@ filed human retailers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation which was created through mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said governmental speaker Z@@ OL@@ TA@@ N K@@ ov@@ acs Repor@@ ter in the southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , that is expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen the border hard to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already to date . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , land @-@ security advis@@ ers for Or@@ ban , said that authorities lift 45 people by trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by the fence , they are now in police force and are acc@@ used by criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are to fix the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials opened in the Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a turn @-@ wagon with sp@@ os@@ wire , to close the borders , arrived . &quot;
&quot; chaos conver@@ sions the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container , to work with the data of people and op@@ pressor a crowd to get out there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 they managed to come into , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
&quot; another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection of Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse to travel food and water until they travel to Hungary . &quot;
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former U.S. Foreign Minister Hill@@ ary Clinton is continuing to keep a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won her face to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the presidential elections ( 58 % previously ) , while S@@ anders is second in second place , at 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who still has@@ n &apos;t announced whether he is for the presidential Office , received support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say that it too early is to say that their opinion stands , what candidates they will support . &quot;
but Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters are in their election more durable than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ News @-@ survey , Clinton had lost a number of dem@@ ographic groups while S@@ anders sc@@ ored some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton is a great lead in women and farms , but these proj@@ ections have decreased . &quot;
their support in the men has declined significantly and S@@ anders is only with 5 points .
&quot; cl@@ int@@ ons advantage in democratic voters under 50 years have been fle@@ eting , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same height . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton had a great advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton had been working with two @-@ digit ahead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections , say that they would support enthusiasm by enthusiasm when they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
a quarter would aid it with some rulers and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Cl@@ int@@ ons current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are stronger by those who currently not support Clinton - only about a quarter would you like to support them .
&quot; during 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections say that they are supporting Clinton with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ublic@@ s all this over her go@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters have asked in an open question why they want the candi@@ da@@ cy is the most common response ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time is that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) , and that they have the best Candi@@ date for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
by Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters also their connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the us@@ ef@@ ulness are c@@ ited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president raises the potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections will see him in the race - although a third believes it should not do . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked to choose the elections , who would be a second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; by Cl@@ int@@ ons followers , more than half , that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far ahead of them . &quot;
&quot; decides Bi@@ den , not to run for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons increased ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in competitions on 30 points without taking him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a Candi@@ date with the best opportunities to win elections ; however , this figure has declined from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ bar@@ est &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , in the question of what is more important when a candidate call the democratic voters regarding voters . &quot;
&quot; just like in the last month , no single country candidate or a potential candidate for the voters of the pre @-@ elections as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic and potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristic of the constitu@@ ents of the pre @-@ elections of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership . &quot;
bi@@ ds cuts among the three candidates most from honest@@ y while Cl@@ int@@ ons strength is the guidance is .
&quot; thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , approximately a quarter of the democratic voters has no idea of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions on Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons will continue to be ques@@ tioned a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as the Secretary of State , most of the Democratic voters of the elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions do not have been influenced . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent have said that their opinion has still deter@@ ior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 , saying that their views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered v@@ ents : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the eligible voters do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the voting land@@ locked far also Tru@@ mp is not honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton and Tru@@ mp receive good notes by leadership . &quot;
&quot; the candidates were best tested by the six , Car@@ son and Bush best for honest@@ y . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders more than sincer@@ ely , but as at Car@@ son many do not have any feedback of him . &quot;
the fault rate for the sample of the 351 Democratic voters of the pres@@ election is 6 pp .
Ben Car@@ son returned to land@@ land pol@@ l close to Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is close to the latest survey of CB@@ S News / New York Times d behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; the two candidates now fall to half the voters in the new pol@@ l , and others are losing dramatically . &quot;
rep@@ ublic@@ ans voters do agri@@ cultur@@ ally still G@@ mp in large numbers . the support is growing by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey conducted by Fox news debate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sh@@ oss in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey revealed also that Car@@ son in dem@@ ographic groups are well received and Tru@@ mp sur@@ fers with rep@@ ublic@@ s with higher education education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio &apos;s govern@@ or Scott Walker , who has been deep@@ est , namely by 10 % support last month to 2 % . &quot;
the former Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , the former Gover@@ nor von Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ cke e and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located with 6 % on the third place . &quot;
the bug@@ ging in the sampling of 3@@ 76 persons of rep@@ ublic@@ ans in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which has been published last week , shows that Car@@ son went to the surveys by 19 % support with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to one of the last week rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp took some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son was ap@@ olog@@ ised to ask Tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp on last Saturday during a show in I@@ owa . &quot;
acceptable temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values can be measured only in the distance , ranges for swim@@ ur@@ ry already a trip to the Mediterranean to find still hot water . &quot;
a bath in north or Baltic Sea is likely to be a more short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
man@@ cher goes no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees Celsius ( DW@@ D ) in the north and Baltic Sea during this week , the German weather service is shares ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continues to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , there are at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes on 28 degrees .
five members of the Br@@ otherhood led to the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Neul@@ ing
&quot; almost two years , after a student during a sch@@ ik@@ an ritu@@ als of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will be filed against five persons . &quot;
members of New York &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PS@@ I @-@ Br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ritu@@ als in September 2013 and hes@@ it@@ ated to hospital which has contributed to his death adop@@ ts the police .
&quot; officials said , it was loaded with its eyes with a 30 pounds back@@ pack of sand loaded and repeated , and repeated , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g said finally over he@@ ada@@ ches , then he fell or impot@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PS@@ I @-@ Br@@ otherhood did not get the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g is power@@ less and wa@@ ited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes to move his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Br@@ otherhood , to seek advice , commented on a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point the members , fos@@ sils had to hide and put the good of the Br@@ otherhood fundamentally about the written by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
he could not revi@@ ved and he died in the next morning to his injuries .
after an Autop@@ gue written th@@ g repeated with bl@@ unt power injuries by head to tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s were added .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Sch@@ ik@@ anen &apos;s Br@@ otherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 every year at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement . &quot;
fr@@ aternity and its members must be held accountable and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended a indic@@ t@@ ment due to murder of the third Gr@@ ades for the first five members .
&quot; twenty @-@ two members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for ch@@ ik@@ an attacks and form of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to make the involved persons responsible , but if there is an organization that has - officially or in@@ officially - this is s@@ ank@@ ered , so we will also hold it to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College is banned the Br@@ otherhood , and the national aternity of withdraw its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases rates
&quot; a inser@@ tion will come , and the landlord will come into w@@ aking , return for bonds , and the economy will float toward a recession . &quot;
this we know .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy gives a little guide to the procedure . &quot;
a recession came over within just 11 months after the first interest increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggressi@@ vity of the Federal Reserve at the raising of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor there as the economy and the financial investment . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed not so veh@@ ement that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase rates , but rather over the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
at the end could market participants find that the whole excitement was ex@@ agger@@ ated because of a inser@@ tion .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted inev@@ it@@ ably by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; budget &quot; , &quot; said Julian Is@@ so@@ p , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om near Capital Economics , in a communication to clients . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at the lowest level to be used to se@@ is@@ mic Sho@@ ck that many to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is one of the historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could respond to :
&quot; as seen in the market last month , the occurrence of c@@ entering things may make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l . &quot;
&quot; once the increase comes , the impact is not so dramatically . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth exp@@ ires 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analy@@ st in a newer study to what is occurring after inser@@ tion threats of the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in exactly the past 35 years , the market has mostly been in warmer - about 14 percent - on the way to cement , fairly flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief system strategy at Nu@@ mer@@ en Asset Management , when Bar@@ ron &apos;s published . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stock tend to occur later in the boo@@ sting cycle and the yield to decrease it begins .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic survival , but disc@@ er@@ ations they often promote it . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is facing some conditions which did not give it before and they could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; extremely not@@ e@@ worthy is here that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in a place of tick , the F@@ ed will be . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 ig@@ ion cuts costs since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3,@@ 6 percent , expect only a few that this will last and expect just 1.5 percent forward for the third quarter after Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; c@@ entering in such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
market participants took place the whole year on a inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday .
&quot; while many Str@@ at@@ ches and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could make an increase in this session , the Futur@@ ES trading may only be a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all boo@@ sters have been taken from 1950 to date in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum when GDP had taken place and pre@@ dating back very fast after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; so the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been awaiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and these have been 74 months .
&quot; the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ l as the market assi@@ sts off a threat , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds will be faster than with shares , when they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; at bonds , the yield seem to switch the direction as soon as the first raise / drop in the cycle takes place . &quot;
at the end of the c@@ eas@@ iness the bond exp@@ ire immediately ; the Deutsche Bank .
Str@@ at@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the rate of interest will result in that yield will move closer to bonds between longer and shorter bonds and push the curve of the curve .
&quot; consuming bonds often bring in such a climate better income , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come an@@ alysts at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop of inflation waiting there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more str@@ ingent monetary policy , &quot; she wrote them . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates rise , the yield ur@@ ve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ n@@ oses have risen and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen - all characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed intensified their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and entire entire companies under@@ ne@@ ath the larger share of their operations in the US , benefit from interest rates and local products are more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multination@@ als with high debts are worse , since an asc@@ ending Dollar will make their products on the global market more expensive and also funding their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares ten@@ ds to respond exc@@ eed@@ ingly positive , three months after an initial appearance , &quot; &quot; said gold @-@ analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exc@@ eeded the company with growth in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital yield as well as lower vol@@ ati@@ lity at their shares also met their counter@@ parts with low quality by average 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are becoming a major problem .
companies with a high percentage of flexible interest will lose most people said gold .
outside of the pure stock market consumers will also profit from rising dollars .
&quot; austerity could see profits by higher y@@ ields , even if experts are in different opinion how soon it will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM @-@ member committee Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; the conserv@@ atives of the parliament cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the transmitter because of its &quot; &quot; du@@ mm@@ age &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is becoming increasingly different from commercial vals .
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards and said that she was just The Br@@ its im@@ i@@ dered
parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins handle the broadcast The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leader member and increases new pressure on the stations , to prove that he does not do something that the private sen@@ ders does not do . &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender &apos; sil@@ ly &apos; and increasingly no longer differ from its commercial vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I use the word &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; - but it seems to transform itself into Classic FM , &quot;
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards held in the last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - this are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only watch what is already on the market , Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Director dism@@ is@@ sed back to the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ing that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and education . &quot;
&quot; what I &apos;m from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new works to order , I also consider it important to be important . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that har@@ med to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing organised in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , among fire , the commercial Rival facing the feet . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins handle The Voice at - the musical talent @-@ show of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for a valued cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see a , why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall consisted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC Way .
&quot; he added , he wishes you to find that the company &quot; &quot; take a hit from our in @-@ house &quot; &quot; barn , &quot; if it is the next time a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , it ref@@ used to ex@@ clude the order of further ranks of The Voice in the Future , or convert money to the pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet revenue grew in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday it can be responsible for this purpose
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online selling .
in the last month the lowest result was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online purchases increased three years ago by using phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has released the expenses
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping mall , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into spirit cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now signs that the online deal@@ ings are stagn@@ ant after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
&quot; experts say that there are indications that online purchases are stagn@@ ant after new numbers , only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot;
&quot; if you consider the growth rates of the previous years and go back to 2000 , then that has always been evol@@ ving in the course of time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ RG sales decline in the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he commented that the online sales revenue grew from three years ago , as a buyer to make shopping with their hand@@ lers purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
but now the one comm@@ utes itself and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is c@@ ited as a reason for the re@@ ass@@ ing turnover .
&quot; experts believe that buyers have their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
last year five times ticket the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gain and some dealers can@@ cel@@ ed .
&quot; belief that Black Friday , in which the Buyer cl@@ ashed against bar@@ gain , buyer of them could hold shopping for purchases . &quot;
&quot; a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium emerged , that from 5 £ spending a little bit more than 1 £ . &quot;
&quot; with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online , instead of the Mo@@ dec@@ antation into the inner cities . &quot;

the number of qualified arti@@ sans in Eastern Europe has a rise behind
&quot; this leads to that 200 other screens shops , which are aimed at craftsmen , will be opened &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales make land wide close
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ dent of the Daily Mail
&quot; it is asser@@ ted that British carry out their offices and brush for the use of skilled East craftsmen who perform their work in their home . &quot;
if you are sent with a hammer or a brush to reach out of walls you are nowadays seem to be a minority .
&quot; for British are increasingly popular cr@@ aft@@ sman in order to run home jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new business leaders of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree markets , said that a large increase in the number of qualified arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to inaugur@@ ate 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that close to craftsmen and to close the 60 outlets of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten arrived in the shop will be affected by women . &quot;
in the moment the men prevail over the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing dem@@ ographic trends , the more female single households that carry more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move it more into a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , which is one of just five women at the head of a British in F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 index listed companies , has also instruc@@ ted her top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in executive positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies almost 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is here an important issue .
&quot; it was not difficult , to find good women for our Supervisory Board . &quot;
King@@ fis@@ her def@@ ends a decline in the half @-@ year &apos;s and the outlines after the group had the cost of closing the stores .
&quot; due to the trend King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new stores . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of judgment
at the heart@@ land Kl@@ agen@@ furt met on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball @-@ Viz@@ or A@@ i / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and disp@@ ense .
the acc@@ used were not guilty .
one of them had been su@@ ed for am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ors .
&quot; from this book , he has been acqu@@ itted to our force in May . &quot;
the present process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Adv@@ oc@@ ative Adv@@ oc@@ ate Robert Ri@@ ffel had found out in the pre @-@ investigations that acc@@ used in the years 2006 to 2011 , has been disp@@ ers@@ ed in their features , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; with the damage it is caused by approximately 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sport @-@ functional are also charged because of financial signs .
&quot; this fact divided the chairman of the S@@ öff@@ ler , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , from . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to the pro@@ filing of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represents that the association came into an asset not at any point in time . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ alities had only been calculated and the sports club , which had been active for the sport of 1982 to 2011 and have invested a lot of time and money from which they have invested a lot of time and money , dating back to 2001 some 600@@ .000 ch@@ illing ( about 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; back then we stood in front of the situation : do we lead the club on or lock ? &quot; , &quot; told a of the acc@@ used , in the Br@@ ot@@ fun@@ f @-@ plant @-@ audit@@ or of the financial market . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task . &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; we have re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated money , our life insurance as security in the bank , &quot; he said in the inspection . &quot;
&quot; with the association was agreed , you can freely manage the money , it may only be made no debt . &quot;
furthermore - due to appropriate financial success the payment of the administration sl@@ ums was postpon@@ ed until 1991 .
&quot; hence , one part of the administration was killed only years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus in the account has been paid . &quot;
therefore also l@@ ump and not detail records of the former Ob@@ mann illustr@@ ates the processes .
&quot; the accounts and as@@ parag@@ us managed the two acc@@ used together , the second acc@@ used . &quot;
why the payments made by the association were not detailed reveal the jud@@ ging .
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial aid , is important only the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one functional investigation of investigation began , an amount amoun@@ ted to 120@@ .000 Euro has been transferred to the club account . &quot;
that was already un@@ law@@ ed av@@ owed the indic@@ tee .
&quot; this content account ran out upon the name of the second acc@@ used , and was not known to the association according to his statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; he wanted to know the judge . &quot;
on that the Be@@ asked question did not answer .
&quot; then he said he finally , he believed that this is the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened , no one would have known anything about this money , he noted the prosec@@ ut@@ or in the room . &quot;
the co @-@ def@@ endant would have been informed and the function@@ alities of the Particip@@ ate .
these refer@@ ral was formulated as &quot; damage rep@@ ut@@ ch . &quot;
why ind@@ em@@ nity ? ? they wanted to know the jud@@ e@@ eper and the prosec@@ ut@@ or .
&quot; that the first acc@@ used , he did not agree with this wording as the association could never arise a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the functional , he has never related a p@@ enny , he just started to redeem and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; in di@@ ets it was charged to the Club 1.000 Euro per month , the actual effort was however much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not prove the acc@@ used .
&quot; these are after a business examination , in which everything was judged as correctly , no longer have been preserved , they explained . &quot;
Kilom@@ eters had also taken the second acc@@ used .
&quot; all will be in cash , for this he has to drive from his home of international market to Bank after B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on September 23 with the reporting of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard Spe@@ aks to more 30.000 jobs

&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2,@@ 7 billion dollars , which will fall in the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs have not yet been completed , and has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP employed at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 still about 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

time for decision on interest rates for US bank@@ note
&quot; the world observed if the U.S. bank@@ note is coming to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to make the important decision whether for the first time in nearly a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey under 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will last a little longer and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0,25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has seven years since the F@@ ed interest has placed on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may aband@@ on the zero @-@ section and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , Gu@@ idance of employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , Bil@@ li@@ on@@ ous dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less strict outlook of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ned the markets , indic@@ ating itself to an increase , but the signs pointed out that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20.00 hours ME@@ Z on Thursday

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play double sentence for double ac@@ upuncture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
&quot; while this entered the left outer junction for the wine and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al is no hope that Sha@@ w can play in this season again . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rec@@ kl@@ ess attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V category .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and required oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has double points of leg and lies in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he will leave tomorrow or perhaps a day later , and then operated in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United which comes very hard and then , and then happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had a oxygen @-@ mask on .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and he won &apos;t play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can again play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy to be a red map and the im@@ position of a El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nicola Riz@@ z@@ oli , the arbit@@ rators , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ected the Italian refer@@ ee had to be mist@@ aken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that an el@@ ight and a red card has been pr@@ one . &quot;
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; a Twe@@ et to Sha@@ w@@ h account I said : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I am coming stronger again . &quot;
here : Manchester United inv@@ enting the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at the PS@@ V
the England def@@ ender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very sil@@ lim@@ me violation . &quot;
if a player with this kind of injury leaves the place all very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Moreno suffered a leg ry as Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you then listen that it is a very f@@ aint breach is that isn &apos;t good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction , so that it looked like he &#91; Moreno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how difficult to be . &quot;
I feel very bad doing it . I am sorry so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought in hospital - after a f@@ moul@@ ding game by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long before you get it almost extensive . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he asked for a supplier of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book decided to call himself Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 sh@@ ien@@ ene environmental policy from Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message ; it is a book that I like to submit to my children , because it seems always a picture or a message that we have so far missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron suppos@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead , there is a abstract of the film version of 2012 playing with new characters and details add to the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled town Th@@ need @-@ Ville where all nature has gone , and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , whose name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose rich@@ est name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss , who died and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this is not yet sus@@ pic@@ tured enough : the text presented by Cameron presented here , partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; though he ad@@ mitt@@ edly to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely to be familiar with the action of the book so little . here , an un@@ anim@@ ate boy , like the local environment by the play@@ able , trees @-@ ring , th@@ ink@@ le @-@ coloured beings who talks in the name of the trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely such a relatively low PR @-@ task is deleg@@ ated to a volunteer , which has not read The Lor@@ ax a 20 times in a new@@ born child . &quot;
a down@@ ing street spok@@ es@@ person said that the text was probably paid by Camer@@ oon &apos;s constitu@@ ent office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons , but there was no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the elimination of England &apos;s squ@@ ad , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; to encounter in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you have selected the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , is a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not make a down@@ war@@ ring .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in batt@@ ing installation , and the community is strong ; they are not wearing any sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test layer , is an option for the attack . &quot;
in @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th separ@@ ators from the England test Ka@@ der and replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th of course , is of course for me as his boss @-@ trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ player is oriented towards results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question mark upon Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I told this - players their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the course of Ly@@ th but had control over his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; if he will find more l@@ ust for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor of Bay@@ l@@ iss pra@@ ised his attitude , even if he did not deliver as good performances , and that struck me not : he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test thr@@ iller gets to put his character , is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - he got nine Comp@@ ton nine .
only Comp@@ ton has got the chance for home and forward play .
&quot; the only acc@@ us@@ ation that one can raise that England was first presented Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in peak form - but this lost opportunity now lies in the past . &quot;
Alex Hal@@ es is coming in and he is a stroke that I appreciate high .
he is a X factor which we saw from Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season as he was 236 oppos@@ ing us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square which was very satisfied us .
&quot; he must receive at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea , mo@@ een beside C@@ ook suggest what an extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler will bring and four qu@@ icks , I emerged , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a stroke cannot beat there ; and this Lef@@ th@@ anded has already shown that he is a devil @-@ cut from Cri@@ cket Player .
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps does not have his job for his County Wor@@ ces@@ ter@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no difference . &quot;
my former team@@ rider Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined the Open@@ er in 2001 .
he has made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and looked no back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; you may see his statistics on - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ c@@ er , but there is no major number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who elev@@ ates their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England a few cl@@ ut@@ ge additions are made available at trainers .
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ding , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master cou@@ p . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , since he played amongst all the conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming up for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful operation in the Setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as player or as a coach ; and as Mah@@ ela he has insights , from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air , even if the messages are in line with the singing . &quot;

such decisions will not be made easy heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it bearings ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Ret@@ rie@@ ve Britain from the EU ) could be appro@@ vals from the economy until the year 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced new@@ building strategy to keep Britain in the EU , will slip himself into difficulties with each day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is there yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour , or the TU@@ C , who was cru@@ m@@ bled by Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ ats un@@ anim@@ ate saying that some member states , so deeply caught in various crises , like the EU it is now and not always from its own gu@@ ilt , Britain themselves put up agenda with the conc@@ essions and dis@@ rup@@ tive conclusion , which they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bright@@ on , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting , that it does not like it , if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they have allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend who would like to over@@ look outside the UK inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can be seen that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ed ministers and officials in some capitals that are not matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s w@@ ro@@ ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a subsidiary , but she has been in power for ten years before it looks bad for them as it looks bad for them as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) , and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande takes a look at his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a flash@@ ing force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left @-@ wing . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that she should rip off a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie control , whose energy should be used better for the UK , Scotland &apos;s unlikely to avoid , because most similar to the st@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers might even tend to un@@ clear remarks , completely at the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ en@@ dum@@ br@@ itt@@ agne in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ected my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt , and &quot; Great Britain has not gained anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans need to know how r@@ ally the Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tic is the oligar@@ chy of the press mode , as it did not have been inspired during the Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms 1975 but did not receive our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Opport@@ unity , who has given a name as a &quot; &quot; EU &apos;s &quot; &quot; ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ he years . &quot;
&quot; in all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sm@@ ur@@ ging , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ In@@ Coun@@ tries , most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air thought much about it , but fixed that when you &apos;re sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , man sitting better ban@@ anas to distr@@ act him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself , when he rejected Camer@@ on &apos;s refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ wir@@ l because Bl@@ air had put the principle on which is not passed the constitution by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which were then an amb@@ ush . &quot;
the press has never seen him that .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster a friendly l@@ apse on his back - I said to him that he didn &apos;t want to repeat any time for me , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ phy of the 80 @-@ er years , an error at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but it must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s official position towards Europe is - I press a friendly welcome - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ b tendency and the wild poems by Tor@@ ies Klein @-@ England can probably tell everyone Yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not a &quot; Ben@@ n &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on TV this week , said that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s appointment of the prov@@ ok@@ s appointment of the pro@@ vo@@ or@@ ant John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it re@@ minded me of the 70 @-@ s , as his old father cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed on TV , is loyal to his Labour cab@@ inet@@ comm@@ on@@ ists without losing being too far and lose his cab@@ inet@@ job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was still more attractive .
&quot; but to fight in order to stay &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ ett &quot; - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C said his Mit@@ ter@@ ites and Members according to all reports on their sent@@ ences during the evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the tou@@ ching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n I want to convey to this , that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a brood @-@ centre of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ dum@@ br@@ campaign for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership - in line with its B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ess economy , their anti @-@ capit@@ alistic past - is no longer just a question of es@@ oter@@ ic discussion among the left bank of dis@@ ar@@ tery a central principle of dog@@ mati@@ tic disputes . &quot;
&quot; like with its ambig@@ u@@ ity to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C is no campaign to leave for leaving , foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find in all a sense of their ad@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin turn to political capital , - they also have sus@@ pic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already rather disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government at power , where I was re@@ minded at the start of Monday by the British influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking origin@@ ates from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) will be joined in the Lanc@@ et by cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze the ti@@ ck@@ eting of Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; current report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
yet some researchers have ques@@ tioned the data base and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a Editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month anticip@@ ates the &quot; extraordinary wind@@ y basis &quot; on the p@@ he was established its most important conclusion .
&quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked , whether the declar@@ ations &quot; will build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ dem@@ i@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he is that &quot; &quot; the present ultimate estim@@ ation is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of rep@@ elling and mod@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ rit@@ eria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis -@@ MC@@ DA ) , to introduce their opinions about the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine products to a synthesis ; the results from the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell we said that a sponsor of the meeting of Euro@@ Swiss Health was , whose director began to have received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also wrote the testim@@ onials of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report and told them .
&quot; one of the 12 participants stated in the meeting to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but do not get the financing that he received after reports previously from tobacco , Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee will not be delivered , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes Champions , some of which also indicate a business financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco .
the session also took part in the tobacco @-@ direction of p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; b@@ lows &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or limitations in the p@@ he report is deb@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell told that the declar@@ ations of p@@ he , that &quot; it has so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; prof Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director for Health and Wellness at p@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J was previously responded to . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second li@@ fel@@ ong pre@@ dat@@ ors dies in his addi@@ ction .
&quot; any evidence is close to the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to that , but that we continue to study the long term impact . &quot;
&quot; he has the unique obligation to inform the public about what the evidence is occupied and what does not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually at a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion € a year . &quot;
&quot; clear precau@@ tions that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of harm to be caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should aband@@ on East@@ En@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop giving programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Riv@@ als &quot; would give her right arm &quot; &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio fees should only be used to make the type of programs which are not sent by other UK stations .
&quot; he cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the BBC for making them publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard contro@@ versi@@ al window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ itters as BB@@ C4 on . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company said to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he has tried for six years in his time on Channel 4 without being able to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC Programs is commissioned or sends , which would also be clearly shown by not sub@@ conven@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus @-@ communications committee in the framework of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I consider medi@@ ated or long @-@ term is not for a good idea , one should do its production at least on programs that do not do or put in order . &quot;
they send the Voice in an excellent time window as they want to achieve as much as possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is natural non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs are financed which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
honest would give other channels to their right arm for it .
I paint me to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a business builder for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said , said that the BBC owe to the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC show this again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , recorded in his Mac@@ Tag@@ g@@ art conference in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they can &apos;t match the audience , but they perform their tasks and they can ar@@ gue on their apparent missions to the justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ Broad@@ casting fees , &quot; &quot; well , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs which no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one would ever wanted to see .
&quot; at the Rund@@ funk@@ Fee &quot; &quot; Johnson said the committee &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions to find the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think all that you will get a great value for 150 € a year here , but for those 150 £ a lot of money , I wonder if that &apos;s right , for it does not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for BBC their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission to provide and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV @-@ production and 0.1 % on the radio , and it should take a sample of the public @-@ legal channels in Australia and Canada . an example is to change , clarify and enter@@ tain them . &quot;
&quot; to question the partnerships said El@@ stone , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , some of whom he said that only a handful of TV will be demonstrated to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control bra@@ id cells through sound @-@ waves

&quot; the impul@@ ses work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane channels , which are responding to ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und waves . &quot;
further informations to this topic : researchers read and write sh@@ in@@ activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the Wor@@ ms pointed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , for an ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und , to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , resear@@ cher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of mill@@ ennium , an invasive procedure which gives the electrical impetus to the treatment of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; wor@@ rying are usually not responding to ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und but Hal@@ as@@ ani made it that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found he out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und waves are influenced by structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ onic channels and in the membran@@ es of some of the thro@@ po@@ et cells .
the sound @-@ waves bring the opening of these I@@ onic channels and activate cells that are associated with such a report Nature Communications .

&quot; when using ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und applied to the changed credit , the sh@@ afts are reinforced by the micro @-@ b@@ lows and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they turn off the modified mot@@ on@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has several simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool , which enables scientists to launch neur@@ ons with stim@@ uli of light and turn off . &quot;
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , that is to be sent to an op@@ tic fiber to the desired place in the brain , the low @-@ rate ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und tissues can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with pleasure and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make temporarily double sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und signal in a clinical attitude for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dor@@ ms
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormitory , but still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but now I remember the ten@@ se smile that I have angry - and to the numerous , leg@@ ged complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I learned is can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
&quot; the suit of student Residen@@ ces reaches from slightly ner@@ ven@@ ing up to absolutely sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sn@@ ak@@ y : people tell about where and where you come , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are &quot; honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - place questions and show interest .
&quot; it lowers the interview and helps you figure out the people you like in contrast to those , with whom you would not talk , even if your eyelashes are in fire , and that fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
allow people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages account , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting , but they are also the places where people wear and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
addressed here : do not think to catch a relationship at the university
-@@ deep@@ ened a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refu@@ ge to be a refu@@ ge , but many student Residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room ben@@ ds culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be the hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship goes on , but you must go away , so I have the energy back I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a cl@@ as@@ best@@ cl@@ one is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
speaking of ank@@ lo@@ bes : do it .
&quot; a guy in my student Residen@@ ces had the idea that a not resol@@ ute door was an invitation . &quot;
he looked some things .
friendship with b@@ aking .
&quot; start the uni at the peak of the Back manager , the clo@@ cking at the doors of people , to imagine less peculi@@ ar as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighbourhood , I have to give you something to b@@ aked out . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends .
&quot; your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and will end up your face with a delicious surprise . &quot;
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
&quot; bad plumbing of fl@@ our , sugar and fat make it possible to make people sle@@ ep@@ y when you get ank@@ p . &quot;
food to ste@@ al is a common crime in student Residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a rob@@ ber@@ y , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the dairy owner .
&quot; the chances are good for they say to serve themselves , even if they cook in the inner . &quot;
&quot; he conc@@ eal your stuff , is the anno@@ ying , and you have my sympathy - but try to handle them as my ro@@ ommate that added their milk a fl@@ ap to pun@@ ish th@@ ieves . &quot;
it is now in prison .
they should not make noise from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the sp@@ wor@@ ts to the men who are sitting in the gl@@ ass@@ house .
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours , whether they make them something narrow , Drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a examination in the morning . &quot;
it re@@ acted to this with even earlier music .
&quot; when she was up at 5 am , she left her neighbors kindly left two hours before she left her own music , shut her door down and settled into her three @-@ hour trial . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to take into the same student residence ?
&quot; the other way round , it would not be aby@@ sm@@ ed if you had a ro@@ ommate for your future spouse to stick to them , and then join them each day , and perhaps face it , how they bring together all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , at least , try to talk a little reason to your ab@@ dom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; in the ex@@ iting moment in which you notice that someone has his key in its not closed room , the border between an ultim@@ k and Mob@@ bing f@@ einer , when it seems . &quot;
a good st@@ reich is funny but it takes only moments until he is going to B@@ um@@ er@@ ang .
tell by adjusting a valuable and am@@ using lesson via security - but don &apos;t leave someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ amp@@ oo .

&quot; I show how one can even buy stuff today and well , &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ er believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds on a project terr@@ aced for refugees .
&quot; Mr G@@ ild@@ er , a lot of refugees will be pushing on the market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ er : mass accommodation in containers or sports halls does not have sustainability .
because people remain to a great part here .
&quot; in view of the refuge@@ e stream , we also need enough living room in the next few decades . &quot;
a very ban@@ quet set @-@ up of the house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ a : a house @-@ detached house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
&quot; that is different , if you put the people in housing . &quot;
&quot; each of the six houses , which are precisely constructed in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will tell , there is peace , I go back . &quot;
then houses can be easily transformed according to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ er : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is adjusted to 184 000 euro , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months has taken the construction .
this is appropriate .
do the assemblies have their plans to be complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ a : construction @-@ legal I have kept my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ cle@@ us special structure and the pitch regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
there is still under@@ going that in a re@@ building house three apartments manages to have at least three plots .
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents respond to their tires @-@ house @-@ project ?
G@@ ild@@ er : there were those who have thrown over me to create luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but do not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competi@@ tor in order to be paid @-@ in apartments ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ a : true one is true : we had a building boom in Germany in the last five years , but were built luxury apartments that can barely afford a more . &quot;
my project has the message to also use the normal people living room .
&quot; not only refugees , but also the educ@@ ative mother or the righteous . &quot;
I show how one can even buy stuff today at a low cost .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are st@@ olen after the installation on problems , as they get a error message that hur@@ ts the &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to deal with the problem , users are advised to either wait , until the crow@@ ds returns or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the telephone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the delet@@ ing of apps to create space - but Apple did not make it more likely , if you use a special tool to delete apps and then install them new once the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s worth to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is located near a charging device , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not admit that the update may be continued since the phone could possibly change in half way and this could lead to a break @-@ off of the updates . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller to take over practi@@ se in field and invest 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship .
&quot; moreover , Sam@@ t@@ gener@@ a deb@@ tor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ists studied at Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ se Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
doctors are missing in many places in the countryside - As@@ endorf arranged on the other hand : Dr. Frank Müller to take over the practice Fel@@ ic@@ ausen on the 1st of October .
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen , his successor is reti@@ ring , her husband &apos;s Karl @-@ Heinrich has left his successor to his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a change phase , Müller opens the practice on the 12th of October , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 euros to the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy for the first sight , when the Fel@@ lowship met in front of years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently completed their professional qualifications in the Ver@@ den@@ er Hospital and will also want to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when I was there , I just inv@@ oked . &quot;
a couple of Müller fell the idea to put their own practice in the future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
we would like to meet and accompany the families over the years .
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss . &quot;
and so one was agreed that the gar@@ bage bought the house with the practice .
live they will continue in An@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ es .
&quot; there is the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller raised , his medical studies in Hanover , followed stations in several medical practice and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
currently he is working as a chief doctor in Sul@@ ingen . in addition he was appointed as a senior staff in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in the DR@@ C @-@ willingness of a fraction of the DR@@ C .
from the 19th of September the practice for the new Chief has been prepared .
&quot; during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ic@@ ausen as a home@@ opath@@ ologist , his spouse has specialised on the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle as household cast . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes therefore out , says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after conversion the rooms are modern look .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and pay@@ load EK@@ GS and need a microphone .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a supplement of about 500@@ 00 Euro will get the gar@@ bage under a funding programme from the county circle ( 25@@ ,000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ ,000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; that shows how proud and happy , we are convinced that the practice is run , &quot; stres@@ ses the deb@@ tor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; around 2000 patients come to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ ge each quarter into practice in practice , in the northern German average practice session there are about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is still another home@@ work@@ station .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practical capture by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no successor would have been found , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; who visits who stands one session , and continue to be in familiar faces : takes the seven medical specialized employees and the cleaning force of the field . &quot;
&quot; with its part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the medi@@ ators have been practic@@ ed there 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , re@@ minded of Ur@@ sel bu@@ gg@@ y . &quot;
a little sad@@ ness for@@ getting them after the long time already .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or , and many patients are still often seen , &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; your man is compl@@ ac@@ eful : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ meter plot . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have always pushed ahead of ground work , now this could be different . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the pair has two grand@@ children and is happy . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we make the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now border controls also be driven at our south @-@ border &quot; , &quot; said the Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border will remain in parallel to it .
&quot; after all , it is clear that everyone wants to make a asylum application , this is also &quot; natural &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; sure , too , &quot; &quot; that there is clear signals &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows - not via the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia wor@@ es &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
&quot; the Croatian government had previously communicated , also Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany and also under circumstances to build cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; quite so , the minist@@ erial Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Stav@@ anger was not seen . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia leads rather the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , border with Croatia is already very controlled by the border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , he wants to settle his borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system can not work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian Government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to travel to East Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to go to the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could spread it in the nearby Ma@@ is@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly meeting the police force with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the days ahead he b@@ lows his country with about 4000 refugees , said Minister of R@@ anko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo at the Maced@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border that had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade stands out , however , that it may be to propose a certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot;
&quot; according to the media , the first bus with around 50 refugees had arrived in the Ser@@ b border town Si@@ d , during the day we would expect further buses . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ m@@ ates were the whole night away from the approximately 500 kilometres from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police declared that we are supposed to drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
&quot; with this , it could now actually occur on the shift of the previous Balkan route to Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia to a somewhat further west @-@ eastern country . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options for limit@@ ing control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s interior of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously empha@@ sized that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong refu@@ ge of refugees corresponding plans for possible out@@ going situations . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t bore him not , but pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive options for limit@@ ing control . &quot;
they run strict controls to qualify for the membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners share a good record , which concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
on Serbian side just stuck behind the Hungarian border fence about 300 refugees .
&quot; according to the Bel@@ gra@@ der media , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing H@@ org@@ os , who spent after R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossing H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees wish to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
&quot; the Serbian Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ re at an early stage in H@@ org@@ os : &quot; &quot; he considers the debate about alternative routes in refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast . &quot;
it would not at present itself to be very high refuge@@ e camps .
&quot; one cannot say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or any other country . &quot;
hel@@ pers rates of migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refuge@@ e shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute the refugees , where alternative routes are being inserted through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the bor@@ derland between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are even 20 years after the end of the country &apos;s victory still not vac@@ ated mine fields . &quot;
on the thir@@ st afternoon the Croatian police were known that a team of mining hosts was sent in the border region .

&quot; that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the tables , but it is understandable , finally it is a very personal matter . &quot;

&quot; the lower view is higher despite the price increases , which are on average 4.@@ 9 percent and despite high inf@@ alls for transpor@@ ting parts of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless , however , that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and because of growth in the online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will bring solid income , if you consider the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the ri@@ vals is planning , 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour power , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share stood at € 2,@@ 42 billion per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of the ferries Investment Research and asked questions . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the h@@ acks were asking the an@@ alysts expecting 12.@@ 23 billion US $ .
Fed@@ Ex has in recent years experienced a decrease in international Pri@@ ority shipping , bringing the turnover in his unit Express delivery for stagn@@ ating . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping found the results with Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
the express unit posted higher revenue due to higher prices while the result is decreased due to higher labour costs in freight for@@ s@@ ank .
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trade , approximately one hour prior to opening , repe@@ ating the Fed@@ Ex shares at 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
on Tuesday they closed by 11 percent loss for year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
&quot; on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen two days sitting around a 27 @-@ foot in Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni &apos;s table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since nearly a decade to head the lad@@ der . &quot;
&quot; th@@ re above them at an end of the wast@@ ed , two @-@ stor@@ ey seating area , is located a picture of the United States . &quot;
&quot; the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ad and her colleagues want to set the economic interests of the nation , before all other things . &quot;
the Central Bank has a second order from the congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. employment and prices thus stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ preced@@ ented mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ di@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the un@@ preced@@ ented stim@@ ul@@ atory since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that they can have solid growth , the latest turbul@@ ences in the global financial markets make the already pre @-@ cau@@ tious f@@ ed representative , to intensi@@ fy this vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only around one quarter percentage . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing to watch what they observe , &quot; &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Ch@@ ef@@ economies in the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to raise the interest rate , the increased ins@@ ec@@ urity about the global market enough justi@@ fication , continues to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is to do and ass@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were told lately about Bloom@@ berg have been predic@@ ted this week .
&quot; financial markets however expect a pick @-@ up of the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ si@@ er , which indicates a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline of the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the str@@ at@@ entered in@@ stit@@ ches carries the blow by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday sp@@ rang the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average worth 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1,@@ 4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 99@@ ,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed politics dict@@ ated the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om said at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the sent@@ ences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you do it , they would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they do not get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts faced that a list of financial markets would calm the financial markets , because they ins@@ ec@@ urity about when the F@@ ed shall act . &quot;
&quot; even before a month the F@@ ed appeared on good ways , the sentence increased about 25 percent@@ ages this month , the first small step in a slow tight@@ ening of mon@@ et@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ e had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints from Liber@@ als , more economic progress would be required to expect an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased down to 5.4 % last month , the lowest possible for over seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage boo@@ sts have shown signs of a recovery .
&quot; and although inflation continued under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives said that the main reason is the temporary impact of clearly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy can deal with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ b@@ om , at Pan@@ the@@ on &apos;s Macro@@ structure . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world suffered from the end of the last month after China had been valued its currency .
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average fell in May by more than 16 % among its peak , considered investors fear@@ ed that a slow@@ down of Chinese economies would be the global growth of th@@ rot@@ tles . &quot;
&quot; the market has a little recovered in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now at almost 10 % below the high level of May . &quot;
for the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives influence the market uph@@ e@@ av@@ al the complex calculation when to increase rates .
&quot; when the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economies in the last few weeks would not occur , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of US @-@ Not@@ en@@ bank . &quot;
&quot; now , he pres@@ upp@@ oses that they will wait at least one month to better get the impact better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main factors of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end it has become the F@@ ed Monetary Authority of the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere note of the then Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed its mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; is able , extingu@@ ish turbul@@ ence around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are becoming increasingly inter@@ f@@ lowed from the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , they can not only super@@ v@@ ise the developments in other places , but also with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of head@@ ings on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to economic fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , de is advoc@@ ated for a list of advertising media , pro@@ gres@@ sed decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut their guidance into three sessions &quot; despite limited recognition effects on growth in the U.S. &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should be aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the mar@@ gins of cooperation in 2008 , said Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee for the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ences are not coming near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly wants not to get into the situation in which they are afraid of a breath @-@ giving ceremony , because the markets took up , &quot; &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that will be changed , I do not believe that they should rise in time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this days .
they welcome you to prepare not without the commitment of inn@@ ate volunteers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are quite a number of people who want to give un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
among them belong Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 people she is still teaching .
every Thursday she does in the asylum seek@@ ers along the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
&quot; he helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan being able to learn German language . &quot;

Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian organization SP@@ RS tries to clarify the sho@@ cking way of women in sho@@ cking how important good nutrition during lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , who are prop@@ elled with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that collect babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements will be pregnant and young mothers , their daily cal@@ orie intake around 500 cal@@ ories per day will increase . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation is to make the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bav@@ arian College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually concerns the genes her babies and protecting them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively impact the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.@@ 3 Million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plan@@ ations for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau at Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ campus make step by step ahead : in the recent public meeting was opened by a large discussion without great discussions .
&quot; in fact , the panel was agreed among other things another request for a construc@@ tive &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; of the valid structural plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; , &quot; it was the permission of a special form with regard to the construction construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof &quot; &quot; should not be built with non @-@ comp@@ elling First and bad@@ ger &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; &quot; this is a great great south @-@ roof , &quot; &quot; explained may@@ or Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; at &quot; liberation &quot; again , in turn it went to the roof pitch that is made up of energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan of itself - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; has therefore been necessary because the construction plan does not per@@ missible for an &quot; exceptions &quot; during the construction plan - with the Bern@@ ph@@ ate council , as a rule on fre@@ eing orders more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; however , the Turn@@ hall@@ ulture is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau at the sports centre is a community @-@ project of the municipality and of the SV Bern@@ ried .
there are approximately 2.@@ 3 million euros in the cost .
subsi@@ dies are expected from the school and gr@@ ass@@ ing funding .
in the next procedure part of the construction contract for the 18 x 36 meter will now be submitted to the land council for the examination .

refugees need accommodation : study ar@@ war@@ ns in front of the house
the location on the German living market is stra@@ ined .
more refugees are still looking for a paid balance .
the pressure on the market market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribu@@ tions in the German living market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and des@@ seek@@ ers from the EU push for more and more people on a market , which is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with in@@ comm@@ on@@ ties to the last be@@ atable apartments .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for numerous homes , we would have to build new units to 2020 every year . &quot;
this result comes a study on behalf of the form of social housing . &quot;
&quot; for comparison , this year in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated in the first three months of their stay , as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial condition to live . &quot;
many then come across the marketplace and rows into the long sn@@ akes in front of the flat @-@ flat .
&quot; according to statisti@@ c Federal Office , however , there were less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only at the increasing number of refugees . &quot;
the study also remains considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the construction policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany &apos;s an apartment defic@@ it before , which is bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently missing in the metro@@ politan areas have already been around 77@@ 0.000 dw@@ ell@@ ings , indic@@ ted by Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities of not@@ able in WG rooms .
young adults remained below the over@@ head on the market offering an optional longer in &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined in the last years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance is propos@@ ing &quot; Social Building &quot; : a Rel@@ aun@@ ching . &quot;
thereby new incentives is to boost the social housing construction again .
so could be disp@@ ens@@ ed on the under@@ read@@ iness tax and the basic tax for promoted apartments are fixed .
&quot; in addition , according to the Alliance &apos;s attractive tax @-@ taking action is necessary . &quot;
the sponsorship programme for refugees in the state of the state Bank K@@ f@@ W comes already well with towns and villages .
&quot; a good week after the start was launched on the assembly line of 184 million euros , more than half of the amount available at approximately 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be stepped up . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia leads cor@@ ridor
&quot; Hungary is practically no escape to Hungary , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the passage across Slovenia to north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; dangerous is the route , however . &quot;
Croatia wants to deal with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian interior minist@@ erial , and when it is necessary we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister R@@ anko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already one of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the closing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to go from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports of the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had tor@@ n its border for refugees at the beginning of the day .
&quot; new laws , which occurred on the same day in force , make an decent asylum procedure in Hungary nearly super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
&quot; most of the h@@ amm@@ ite media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk on foot via the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees arrive not at the border fence . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border stri@@ ps to other dangers . there are still sharp min@@ es from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
Min@@ en@@ spatial aims to quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary after the closure of the border , there are hardly any refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted the police 366 da@@ ined people .
shortly before the Tor@@ sh@@ o on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws boost the overcoming and damage of the border review as a crime .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border city Sz@@ eged will therefore be initiated by 35 criminal proceedings .
the condemned thre@@ aten thre@@ aten up to five years and exp@@ ul@@ sion from the country .
&quot; on Tuesday , after the immigration authority , we took the Tuesday to the newly at the border &quot; &quot; Tran@@ se@@ ated &quot; &quot; with a total of 94 asylum orders , almost all - 93 - on the most important transition mark@@ ers . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
at the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow there were still 40 refugees away .
&quot; however , it is practically no longer a prospect of getting to get granted in Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; in hung@@ arian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be given over there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to dream .
they collected the tr@@ ash which left the ti@@ of thousands of people over the past weeks at the road@@ side .
pl@@ ywood were rebuilt and one of the se@@ pul@@ le@@ ager in the bor@@ derland was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this set @-@ up .
Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only few refugees .
the country also has strengthened its border controls .
&quot; in order to meet the 20,000 migrants , but still in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the German authorities .
in free@@ zing met regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .

&quot; because Germany had a surprisingly busy railway transport with Austria on Sunday , for it was an end for them in Wer@@ n@@ stein , &quot; as a town@@ ship , immediately his help offered and the mess@@ enger together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the Nahe river Passau . &quot;
&quot; previously , we had the un@@ hop@@ ed guests once shortened , with j@@ ause and drink . &quot;
&quot; we have said right , we bring them by car to Passau . &quot;
&quot; that was of course for us , as a town@@ house in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
one man did not let it take to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire of fire .
&quot; this is very glad , so the town@@ house . &quot;
&quot; the draw @-@ visitors were re@@ acted at the Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional train towards Passau , in order to dis@@ continuation it following the notice that the train traffic to Germany was dis@@ continued , but still on the border to try . &quot;
the regional train was put down in front of the border in Wer@@ n@@ stein am Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein is the cross @-@ border general high in the course .
the bridge @-@ linked linked with the Bav@@ arian neighbors on Sunday for@@ et@@ ely in advance - organiz@@ es a branch @-@ bridge spor@@ ty - organized by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; now Viktor Or@@ b@@ án can now send more f@@ ences to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing politics : &quot;
&quot; instead of promoting structures at the establishment of structures , ensuring humanity has been highly publi@@ ci@@ zed and publicly the position of the Hungarian government tor@@ tured in the dark circle of the National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; Lei@@ d@@ seek@@ ers of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted on the border @-@ areas with cha@@ otic conditions . &quot;
&quot; the refuge@@ e have to notice that the &quot; &quot; pra@@ ised Land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcome , nothing but another refuge@@ e camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a big challenge , given the lasting refuge@@ e rivers and the approaching winter , with us decent conditions for protective addi@@ tives . &quot;
&quot; and there will be another bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad on the search for 3@@ 5.000 , firm Quar@@ ry &quot;
Konrad has filled all hands with the refuge@@ e control of all hands
Christian Konrad is familiar to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker to establish lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos in the first @-@ condition Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad already has got a handle on the handle . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success . &quot;
&quot; accommo@@ dates of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday to Austria , be said without great vor@@ tex , &quot; Konrad and pra@@ ised the organisational &quot; master . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the State of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , however , spoke of a &quot; cr@@ is@@ enh@@ old situation . &quot;
&quot; overall , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ ry in the he@@ uris@@ y year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , we have to be found 3@@ 5.000 accommodations in the coming weeks - 20,000 people are supposed to provide the countries , 15.@@ 000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should it be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; Konrad . &quot;
with the state @-@ time he has already led discussion .
they would have promised him to create lod@@ g@@ ings also for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it is good , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ burg , thereby it is to be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations is the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private people can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Not@@ a , it would not be that accommodation editor will have to conc@@ ise a certain amount of the Hand@@ tu@@ b@@ holders or the size of the fin@@ s . &quot;
for a temporary time would have to apply &quot; Not@@ standards &quot; .
&quot; that he is more successful in contrast to the State Department in the accommodation , but Konrad with his experience . &quot;
I am an older gentl@@ eman in which one cannot say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
beliefs is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause any cost , as they explained himself . &quot;
their employees want to increase it on three to four .
the own lod@@ g@@ ings had not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; however , there are apparently problems with the permit . &quot;
Linz calls for better distribution
&quot; the only opening of the city &apos;s city of city and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena , and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary , since the person affected people currently can accommodate without these measures , says Mayor Klaus L@@ ug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot;
for the emergency situation further locations will be checked for their fitness .
criticism of the Municip@@ ality is exercis@@ ed in the division of refugees within the federal state .
other areas must also make their contribution .
above @-@ sea @-@ level : &quot; borders are not viol@@ ated &quot;
in a longer telephone call by the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Vol@@ o@@ fer ( C@@ SU ) has indicated govern@@ or Josef P@@ ef@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the next steps in the refuge@@ e question .
above @-@ above has ass@@ ures me that German borders are not viol@@ ated .
the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic will continue to be possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; special payments with refugees to Germany will be no longer there . &quot;
however the prot@@ ectors would however have brought with regular trains to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger demanded more increased solidarity in the refuge@@ e question . &quot;
&quot; that Austria has again in@@ scri@@ bed Austria to its borders , is a logical consequence &quot; of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the General Manager of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz Industry line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T moved , the remainder ( 27@@ 00 m ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT are the clever heads of our raw materials - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chef Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine to invest in start@@ up companies of the Neue Wer@@ ft and later also to ak@@ rate .
&quot; from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to collaborate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.9 million Euros were invested in the plant by S &amp; T in the plant , 3,@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is certified from the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meter in the building are rented out , for another 40 per cent there are requests . &quot;
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni &apos;s owner opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop vene@@ er @-@ hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ ad wanted to put a dog .
this project had to shift the 49 year @-@ round owners of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tauern market short@@ cut and finally she has now gotten deeper in the form of another business location .
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the company , in which they s@@ ells pockets , suitcases , shoes and tissues of various manufacturers , now all around the bags brand she@@ ers are starting from 75 euro . &quot;
greater pockets and accessories costs up to 500 Euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
&quot; previously , several weeks has been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long over@@ laid out whether I still want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among others , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna , from the idea of a private location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the he@@ aters in the Greater Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
their fashion interest has given Bre@@ it from her m@@ om into the cradle .
&quot; to me , most when something developed and I can show new trends to high @-@ performance prices . &quot;
&quot; why so some women can keep track of a beautiful hand@@ bag in consumption , also the specialist can not be answered with absolute certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful p@@ ouch is fit for each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the thre@@ e@@ fold ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called Recommen@@ ded .
this property also connects man@@ sions with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the U.S. president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always available for off @-@ off .
whether it is manifest@@ ed itself as xen@@ opho@@ bic ( journalist or scientist in the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant for the US presidential Office and the election campaigns .
and cuts well in doing so .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real @-@ milli@@ ard flight . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ er track is a term in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf at the Wein@@ straße .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ resident place is related over -@@ y corners with him .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in El@@ ectoral mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his aim to become a mighty man in the world ?
&quot; I think that is somehow fascinating , but are not so deeply impressed in their neighborhood , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous s@@ war@@ ns to which beside Tru@@ mp also counts the Ket@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz .
&quot; Tru@@ mp is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
but the king of the hearts he did not put it there .
&quot; although there are respect for the performance of the family , but also bi@@ ased the opinion that Tru@@ mp is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; random@@ ly loud the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too Hoch@@ deutsch : the quot@@ a , says it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is therefore coming from the village of the Con@@ ferences .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 1885 when the later grandfather went out and in the USA opened a e@@ ater@@ y for gold gr@@ aci@@ ers .
corner@@ stone of the real estate companies were first plot of purchase in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of Trag@@ ic : your desire to return to the homeland , sent to the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Palatinate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once without permission , the director of the Institut für pf@@ alz @-@ History and Economics , Roland Paul , explains to Film@@ start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal ou@@ tre@@ ad . &quot;
this is in contrast to the statements of the off@@ spring .
&quot; he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall , to prevent illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; as the pol@@ tert , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote @-@ born Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ eg@@ rower in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so cru@@ el . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never taken care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the retirement present Ver@@ on@@ ika Schr@@ amm is mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz during a visit something for the F@@ athers , what generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; that can I imagine of Donald &apos;s , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they take it better if he did not bear the choice , for &quot; he has such a radical view , I do not know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; those who had been in the United States at the time of his grandfather in the United States , had been as if he had never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are interesting topics as it , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ cks Sarah B@@ üh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; says she . &quot;

un@@ vei@@ ls secret ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have not know@@ ingly who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was un@@ vei@@ led in primary secrecy . &quot;
and none of the remaining remaining girls will certainly not award if it is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before being made of three two , including check@@ ups , you may possibly have given an indication of who the winner will be . &quot;
Sam Wood holds its lips until the final on Thursday to be sealed
&quot; all three women dropped out on ly@@ rical way , why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambi@@ tion , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is posed &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; , &quot; if their answers to the game will be destroyed , who won the heart of the Wag@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki dr@@ ones both quickly - except for itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies have noticed that they were pretty compatible , and I &apos;ve thought it throughout the show , &quot; &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; he added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
you feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the group visit last week has made her clear that wood &quot; The One . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ stopp@@ able to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , whom Wood sel@@ f@@ le , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL @-@ career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle demonstrated great interest after moving into the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ es chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ p@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
&quot; some trainers could have banned Hay@@ es for the rest of the game to the Bank , when he lost a sc@@ angel , how the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by @-@ League conver@@ ts at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 win in Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula familiar with his husband and gave Hay@@ es the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing play after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ as@@ ula continues to show its true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ as@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ es also public in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ es was also encouraged by the specialist team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who has got to for@@ got his pack catch up and take care of the next game . &quot;

it was certainly not the start to read the Hay@@ es and his massive Australian Nar@@ r@@ ity for his N@@ FL @-@ Deb@@ t .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and spoke later to the au@@ str@@ al Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he would not have a bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that now occurs , you just takes care of the next game , and that is it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;

&quot; so it is not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free el@@ ectors as soon as possible .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen rubber hike on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police mel@@ lowed a crowd , demonstr@@ ating the proposed new constitution , said a be@@ amer on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out in the morning night in the district Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; Bis@@ hn@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Vice @-@ State District Apostles , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of them were bricks and br@@ bom@@ bs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ d and then shot into the air before they return on rubber hike .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians have been viol@@ ated , &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear , why the used rubber compound , known by which they can kill , but is traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the examination was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ al@@ southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces , which would reduce within the framework of the proposed new Constitution . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus ades which want to make up an own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police forces , were in violent struggles since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed August 3 when the four major political parties signed an agreement to tr@@ ap the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very contro@@ versi@@ al issue in Nepal , the centuries has been centrally ruled . &quot;
&quot; working on a new Constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator acceler@@ ated the process after the devast@@ ating earthqu@@ akes , which had killed in April thousands of people . &quot;
&quot; the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitu@@ tional definition in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the City
the plot when em@@ bos@@ ch &apos;s youth center is scheduled to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter surface .
&quot; the plan is to be a mixture of trade , commercial and living - concrete offers but still not . &quot;
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den is to market some 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the youth center Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently running .
&quot; plan is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; wait for appropriate offers , it is about the part of the town . &quot;
which investor @-@ question may not be clear yet .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were closed . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , that is situated at the Ring@@ straße / corner Large street , already bought a few months ago and can rip it to the ris@@ ome building . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
the plan@@ ations of the cottages on the little sea near Em@@ den are taking shape .
the investor was first publicly set up plans for the project .

&quot; Monthly doors had been negotiated behind closed doors , v@@ owed , deb@@ ated and marked . &quot;
&quot; now , the plans for a new holiday cottage to the little sea near the Em@@ den on the table . &quot;
&quot; the prosp@@ ective , the medium @-@ sized em@@ aker &quot; &quot; System Construction &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal develop@@ ment@@ or Committee of the Em@@ bar@@ Council . &quot;
it originally had that point on the non @-@ public part of the day of the day .
&quot; under pressure from the critics and the F@@ DP Group , Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ing went pre@@ matur@@ ation from the system building management into the offensive : &quot; &quot; we still didn &apos;t answer any questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
&quot; however , it is good to be able to encounter all the od@@ ors . &quot;
the project around ten to twelve million Euros has been in discussion for months now .
&quot; intense reactions to sea @-@ bu@@ den@@ ers came into the meeting , they called the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bus@@ h@@ owner and Executive Officer at the stakeholders of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , charged : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z , who domin@@ ates all the other past@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; moreover , he fear@@ ed like any other project critics that the traffic through which intended size of the system would increase : &quot; there must be whole of the bos@@ itations , so that it expects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the good one hect@@ are of the former Gast@@ stätte , however is still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a conclusi@@ ve concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this is not yet inf@@ alli@@ ble , the development plans are not yet variable . &quot;

Google starts de@@ dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to raise € 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign that should help thousands of refugees who will help thousands of refugees who are overwhel@@ med by the European nations , since they fled from the war and fle@@ eing countries . &quot;
Google has un@@ usually personal approach to disclosure of donations to his blog .
&quot; instead of giving a manager the announcement made by Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who fled to her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; on our journey were many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote them . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refuge@@ e crisis and migrants are grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ perate for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High @-@ Com@@ miss@@ ary for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million to googl@@ e.com / or will be upgraded to 11 million $ . &quot;
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refuge@@ e crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , distributed over 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many fle@@ e from the war of Afghanistan , Y@@ emen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

for slightly overweight dia@@ be@@ tics can be weight loss surgery helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss is longer life than those that do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a Editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
weight loss or Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery is using different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years have proven obesity for the treatment of type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been carried out with people who are path@@ ologic with an Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that anyone is overweight , and people with BM@@ I over 30 are regarded as obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study , compare two types of Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery - Mag@@ en@@ b@@ yp@@ ass and Mag@@ ni@@ b@@ yp@@ ass - Medical treatments for type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes in people who were easily overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I under which this operation is under@@ gone from 31 to 24.@@ 5 till the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who have non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ gone a surgical procedure , sol@@ ves with 36 % the diabetes disorder completely and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes is not only a percentage of percent and partially with only two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Cholester@@ ols &apos; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also sur@@ ge the patient @-@ blood cell of Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , who reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent by writing the researchers .
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level of about 9 percent to about 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but these better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; &quot; - as you are reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mortality in five years , so the leit@@ ner resear@@ cher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also uses average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass @-@ Surgery Clinic has lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , att@@ ained bigger post@@ ulates in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 against 5.1 ) and Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.@@ 1 % vs. 2.1 % ) , and already experienced a complete overcoming of the Diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16,@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not cause a survival part of the surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of heavy people in Sweden that lead surgery to a longer life , Black@@ stone says from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was with obes@@ e people who had to die out of a obesity , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - in comparison to a group that conven@@ tionally @-@ conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I less than 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this trial , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without raised risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone is added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we will wait too long until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have plug@@ ged their body with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love story in H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is a theme , which is currently ob@@ serving in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ sight@@ ly , meets after years the flo@@ ating of her youth and this is love in her . &quot;
so also in the recently established novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Luisa binder .
about the love story that the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r@@ ator because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author is grown in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that they could put his hom@@ etown a liter@@ ary monument .
&quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot vote all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refuge@@ e crisis in the Middle East said . &quot;
the ti@@ be@@ tic Buddh@@ ist leader called on to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of permanent refuge@@ e rise at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford with regard to ethics studies .
he asked that in the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be made before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also empha@@ sized that the reaction of West European countries to the refuge@@ e crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; though the Dalai Lama himself and Austria &apos;s efforts in overcoming the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot;
in the end we have to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force never solved these issues , he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and introduced that the violent reaction of the USA moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after the 11th of September , I put my fellow sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that has un@@ expected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of hand san@@ iti@@ zer through children in the past 4 years
&quot; in the United States , Gi@@ ft@@ Control centers in the United States report almost 400 @-@ percentage increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts from hand@@ ing inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the po@@ ison control centers report , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children always come more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out of the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants have dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant while some do them to impress your friends or because of a mut@@ ation of social media .
show videos on YouTube like te@@ ens dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
young@@ sters have suppos@@ edly mixed with dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant / non @-@ alcoholic m@@ outh@@ wash to get a tough@@ er beverage .
younger children can be caught by attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange shower , which are very pleas@@ ing for children . &quot;
wall dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in case of to@@ dd@@ lers can already lead few sy@@ ringe at the alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical Director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ebook in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let go wh@@ is@@ ky wh@@ is@@ ky , but people leave this hand inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Russell , a six @-@ year girl who had recently taken four spra@@ yer of the hand san@@ iti@@ zer and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in school , was taken into an emergency . &quot;
&quot; your blood drink was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold , which applies by an adult laws , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated it in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah l@@ all@@ te her words and wasn &apos;t able to go as she anch@@ oring in the emergency .
&quot; doctors over@@ clim@@ bed her over night in a separate children &apos;s house on signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and was caught the head , &quot; Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very fright@@ ening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been more deadly to my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use soft products or inf@@ ect@@ ants and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
over alcohol @-@ tox@@ ins were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario , after the sl@@ ing of hand@@ ing inf@@ ect@@ ants , which includes a toxic , not dedicated ingre@@ dient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities susp@@ ects that the product contained meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , rather than an active ingre@@ dient , was listed as an active ingre@@ dient . &quot;
&quot; in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; &quot; master instruc@@ tors , in order to cast anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says it a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly arti@@ sti@@ cally allergic to the san@@ iti@@ zer and den@@ amed it from her room .
&quot; the police regarded the planned plan as &quot; &quot; br@@ oth &quot; &quot; and prev@@ discipl@@ ined measures to the debt authority . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; at a driv@@ eway on the cross@@ roads between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and On Her@@ oes , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car has been easily viol@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck drivers went to the cross@@ bar in the direction of the roundabout , and accepted too late that at the roundabout two planned vehicles had been hal@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he pr@@ un@@ ted with his trucks in the h@@ eck of an audio and whether this vehicle is placed on an earlier Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;

&quot; currently Bo@@ er , currently a Ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland does not show any highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers is not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland that want to see these games . &quot;

now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;

&quot; I voted , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists should see exec@@ utions in the US and since often more applicants are available as places to choose , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery is taking place to decide who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who will be chosen will it be emotional .
I cannot do that .
in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps I will sit in my friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ony and a two @-@ hour visit .
I like the guy .
we lau@@ gh many times when we speak .
&quot; the j@@ ail authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and take a pen to take up what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma describe me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the screensaver like he wants it and you will get access .
I pay attention to her .
&quot; they feel that they could have no better form@@ ulate about , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
&quot; I said to him , that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot;
however he wants that an international Repor@@ ter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a Repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the pod@@ casts series . &quot;
I will not go here again to see all details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is in@@ no@@ cent .
&quot; his acts after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese , would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of action . &quot;
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of mor@@ tal .
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a death .
I believe that its execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I shall see him dying .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
others re@@ por@@ ter will give in which you can turn to for this .
&quot; what you will get from me , is what it means to see a man the necessary death . &quot;
man stri@@ ving to mo@@ ist police forces hunt from the C@@ anning River
&quot; the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ is remained dry , when he sp@@ ake the man from the C@@ anning River . &quot;
&quot; an attempt to hang a man of Per@@ th , the police was un@@ successful , when he found himself in the submitted and su@@ mp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police force , which tried to move him gently to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was born on Tuesday to a domestic break@@ down in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ected , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water@@ - and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and hol me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; De@@ stable Sal@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ v@@ ec was not too enthusiastic about making his Uni@@ form , so he turned into a reliable tac@@ tic &quot; a good pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people doing funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master@@ pieces Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins went his car into the dit@@ ch to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards were tried to negotiate him and dro@@ ves the racing sports
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and dis@@ continue to end the race immediately .
he pointed to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the full Department of Racing Victoria and asser@@ ted that they led a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a racing day treatment that last stra@@ w on Wednesday .
m@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media that he always tries to do what is best for racing and he even found themselves in difficult conditions to see the positive Kob@@ alt trial of Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; he had kept herself for 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age pre@@ y decre@@ es and would not want it to be &quot; &quot; see like too high suspended grapes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing to say anything , and I have long looked after , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything gets stuck at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it goes on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I must live with it what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to go by the head , and I want my owners think I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I do not do this , then I should not be any more coach . &quot;
&quot; I have to think , what I do with my license . &quot;
previously m@@ oo@@ dy had the Bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com state that the Integr@@ ator Department had tried to hide its shed .
&quot; before eight@@ een months sa@@ e Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - whom I am asked - and offered him a work in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said m@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they are trying to put me into it . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , official President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should I bring this to the view that it personally becomes ?
&quot; has the RV@@ L conf@@ ess and does perhaps responsible people outside of trainers , what is happening in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the business ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and b@@ ail me , and I have no doubt that what I say , she can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where I am concerned , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
&quot; I will exercise the pressure on them , and push them to make a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of trainers have built up with the long @-@ lasting Kob@@ alt examination of Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he said he could throw his license over the table .
&quot; m@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s best known for his preparation of the un@@ written master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the racing Mon@@ days @-@ treatment rule &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse , what fell against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take on responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mist@@ ak@@ enly called the leg .
it could have been that yesterday evening .
I could have been so yesterday the whole day what was so .
but it was also like that on the race day .
m@@ oo@@ dy could be associated with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the racing day . an inquiry of this proposition was opened .
it is a joke .
people who imp@@ ose these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see one that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y strikes against ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations to ring fight
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has cri@@ tique of tac@@ tic his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League Favorites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Ro@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ er gave the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring fighters &quot; with his team during the high Storm @-@ Si@@ egs in the qualifying @-@ Final in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Br@@ isb@@ ane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely covered comment on the Storm @-@ Team after his team sc@@ ored the final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Satur@@ days , and said that the two of Queens@@ land were not too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that they may only be concentrated on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; at the Tac@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team showed him confident as it was worried , that they were worried , taken up by the Storm @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; this p@@ opp@@ ed again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ tone , when she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed in our def@@ ective system or techniques for the last six weeks , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tactics to a real focus , and that has performed for us the Tr@@ end@@ wende . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not to lose used , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it is strange as this is always coming to this season again .
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett idea from &quot; exciting football &quot; and re@@ minded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra is the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; so@@ ccer . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our evening Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of it a she@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team who can play and see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball game , which you want to play if you have this kind of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as this . &quot;
&quot; I increased trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think of us when the Big Games went .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game Storm against ro@@ sters had a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not yet considered , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that a thr@@ illing game ? &quot;
or have p@@ auses do and no points do something consuming ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
&quot; when they mention , it means that in a phase we will meet again . &quot;
&quot; the Storm @-@ team has free on this weekend as they have won the right , either North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the finals at A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales starts from the next year morning . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200@@ .000 $ deposit on drug pre@@ age
&quot; a man who may have been threat@@ ening a life @-@ long punishment because of his promise to come into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was de@@ vised by Queens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 each . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men , were arrested the last month after the federal police fell 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ Ph@@ c was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse , where the police were 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite an possibly life @-@ based punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ain , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the total amount and that in the cafe could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Fl@@ agan , was worried about the escape from Mak@@ si@@ dents c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the case of corruption the police have weigh@@ ed the police about its place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and st@@ ep@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as a security jointly to achieve its release .
&quot; after reading the enclosed explanations of the two persons it is clear that the edition represents a security of 200,000 dollars a real financial burden , &quot; said judge Fl@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; however , this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent it from it , not to appear , war@@ ned it . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ Ph@@ c was released against deposit on arrival , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian passport , en@@ cl@@ ade in the police daily and lock themselves at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

the mass makes it : every two years the A@@ AA show its novel@@ ties on the I@@ AA .
especially movement for the compact vehicles that are currently especially good for sale .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : about 28,@@ 1 per cent of the new registr@@ ations were according to the force of force ( KBA ) alone in August at this segment .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( publication from 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concepts and new upper @-@ class , and luxury cars will be presented in this year especially many new compact models . &quot;
&quot; one of the largest Pre@@ m@@ ation for the German high@@ ran@@ che is the Opel Astra , which will be present at the deal@@ ership in autumn . &quot;
&quot; Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra be also not much more expensive for it . &quot;
&quot; Opel is an entrance below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf in views , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra cost from 16 990 € .
Astra is available with a new 1.4 l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; furthermore , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / / 200 PS , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gas@@ oline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel is not only the Opel Astra . &quot;
&quot; as a second variation in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also already shown at the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will be the Astra on the I@@ AA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra the Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
on the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e will only be seen as a fifth in a conventional and full sporting GT version .
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he is coming as Com@@ bi . &quot;
&quot; Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment , Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 . &quot;
the Nissan SP@@ s is aiming to find his position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in doing so , the compact infin@@ iti adap@@ ts with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a gas@@ oline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , who is celeb@@ rates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square meters of cells are un@@ un@@ worthy of man
&quot; the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has given a Ex @-@ pris@@ oner of the Prosec@@ ut@@ ary quarter , which was accommo@@ dated monthly in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees have generally been entitled to financial compensation if they were accom@@ od@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this decision has decided the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in any on Wednesday .
suffer@@ ers may ad@@ ress the judges even if they were locked up to money if only a few days were locked into tight spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; this was a Ex @-@ pris@@ oner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommo@@ dated in the judicial process in Berlin between June and November 2009 in a single room with approximately five square meters ground floor ; the toilet was spacious , non @-@ separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who has now turned according to his prison back on an open air , has been laid down in a bigger cell . &quot;
his am@@ nest@@ ing law because of the un@@ worthy ar@@ rest conditions against the State of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitu@@ ed hop@@ ed hop@@ ed the judgment of the Court of Berlin on and transferred the case to the renewed examination . &quot;
they see the human dignity of the man hurt .
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the frag@@ ile period only a few days of liability for compensation are decisive , whether there was a compensation . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be to fear . &quot;
the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al must now clarify the amount of the money loss .
the constitutional inverters have often met the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; so , they said only in April a pris@@ oner damage , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 , as well as the multi @-@ subject area of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , also confirmed the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , which had agreed on a tu@@ pris@@ oner in a Parall@@ el@@ apse in November 2009 an decent accommodation . &quot;
&quot; the dam@@ , Kl@@ äger soldiers had four months away daily between 15 and 21 hours in a compar@@ ative cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come into the last weeks even because of the lack of staff in the head@@ lines .
&quot; pris@@ oner are therefore always enclosed 23 hours including aggressi@@ vity rising , even to bat , it should be due for the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information of the reci@@ proc@@ ating table , 21 positions in T@@ egel are not occupied because of young people , 19 should 2016 exp@@ ire . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refuge@@ e policy : &quot; we make the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the Chancellor is dedicated to adopt them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany for forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Germany this year , according to a statement by vice @-@ founder Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany , even able to absor@@ b a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated with the un@@ common challenge : &quot; I say once again and again : we can create this and we create it .
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; after different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Culture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - namely the next five years . &quot;
that is almost twice as much as it is built before ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living space , but above all in paid rentals : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing from the lease , and around these particularly favourable apartments will also apply refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the promotion , from currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 soci@@ etal rewards a year would have to arise , and the federal government would have to invest a funding of around 6.7 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , scientists and Federal Minister of Ministers agree that there must also be more control of investments for investment in the housing . &quot;
&quot; according to the Council of the Institute for Employment Research and occupational research , it is likely to be in fact that 55 percent of the refuge@@ e have been employed in Germany in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not have been asked even systematically after their qualifications to help them get started to critic@@ ised the Claudia Walter , project man@@ ag@@ erin for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
but the integration of refugees is essential if they find jobs in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreci@@ ating the esteem , but also to the self @-@ esteem of the emig@@ rants , says Mig@@ rations T@@ scher Diet@@ rich throne . &quot;
&quot; according to thr@@ ust , a political transition in Germany has given a political transition : from employment ban for refugees to recognition from work . &quot;
&quot; while it used to be an employment ban for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced in three months at three months as well as the residen@@ cy light , an asylum seek@@ ers located to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society - also because of the lack of labour lack of labour - , of the perspective that refugees should be enabled faster to access the labour market . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
&quot; so far , there is still no sufficient offer of general and calm @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs most often be taught by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore according to a view of thr@@ ill from the König@@ s@@ way into labour integration .
&quot; the Berlin Foundation administration has established that only a few refugees can give their children into the kit@@ es , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bar , spok@@ es@@ man for the youth and family in the Berlin Sen@@ ats@@ verwaltung . &quot;
to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita divided the administration of tow@@ el in different languages .
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators should rise strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the apprentic@@ es@@ hips - e.g. by giving more professional schools . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared with no English knowledge at the classes .
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by instruc@@ tors who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; to them there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk estimated that about 20 per cent of refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no European asylum seek@@ ers or memorial had prohibited the study - the only exception was so far as Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its attitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; studying refugees could be facilit@@ ated for facilit@@ ating access to the university . &quot;
&quot; for refugees with a residence or D@@ ul@@ ing do not receive any performances after the asylum seek@@ er Act , if they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter are based in principle no BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they do not fall under the circle of the two @-@ eligible persons . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to be lived in Germany for four years now , in order to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 , this sp@@ ice reduces to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financial gap has to be closed but Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s Under@@ secret@@ ary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get the BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will continue to play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of its identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should uph@@ old the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches to develop a new state of religions . &quot;
&quot; important also , the establishment of an Islamic welfare state would be professionally taking care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
among the rights are also obligations .
&quot; the representative of Islam must agree to a clear contact person and be prepared to co @-@ operate with the state in many areas , and give it some control possibilities . &quot;
this also belongs to the willingness to face against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed by Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to ex@@ alt such conflicts in Germany have instantly got their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will be much more likely to be a topic of society in the future .
&quot; in this way , the majority of majority of society will also have to change discrimination and racism . &quot;
&quot; Germany has , as a result of European decisions , since a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general gender equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it is slow to learn how the N@@ SU ring series showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist mot@@ if systematically ignored . &quot;
equal opportunities for everyone : what mig@@ rant organisations and the interests of interest in Russia have long been calling for and what are committed to international agreements such as anti @-@ rac@@ ist policies in Germany must remain in the next few years if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens want to use - for the benefit of all .
&quot; generally , Germany has been able to feed the prosp@@ ective refugees medical , says doctor @-@ vice president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ acities , we create that , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , it also makes additional money flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid penetration , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all com@@ ers equal to the registration of health . &quot;
services could later be tor@@ tured later with the federal states .
&quot; in the long run it is highly ques@@ tion@@ able , so many people look at the limited range of catalogue and ex@@ porting the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors are doing especially the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health resear@@ cher@@ as Th@@ ea Bor@@ de has been proven that migrants are worse off their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical practice would have to be adopted at medical costs , call them . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also have helped with more general medical imaging in the emergency . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
under refuge@@ e sk@@ ill@@ ars approximately there are clearly more harmless people and the young people go to HIV En@@ light@@ enment .
&quot; with the partly rest of the disease , German doctors practi@@ ses from their education , but clearly , means Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite dis@@ inf@@ estation , or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognize . and what affects the anno@@ ying angel , either by the refugees actually even all@@ evi@@ ation in sight . &quot;
Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly evolved education system that are even doctors .
&quot; in order to practic@@ ing practic@@ ing , however , they would have to prove their qualification and bl@@ ur@@ ry again test . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is according to the estimates of the Bund@@ ess@@ lab@@ ut@@ enk@@ amm@@ ers ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psychological , most suffer from a post@@ injury risk @-@ depres@@ sive or under depression . &quot;
&quot; he said especially vulnerable to refuge@@ e , Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study of the Technical University Munich proves that any fifth refuge@@ e camp trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany arrives .
&quot; who is suffering from a post@@ injury @-@ depres@@ sive disorder , suff@@ ers from others on so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , vibr@@ ating , heart@@ beat and de@@ ar@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; additional symptoms are sle@@ ep@@ tive and con@@ cent@@ ation disorders , thick shar@@ mon@@ ary and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms of chronic , whether an early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , only four per cent of the psych@@ ical cran@@ ial refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; though they may pose psych@@ ically sick @-@ seek@@ ers in social places for psych@@ otherapy , but the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social co @-@ workers mostly workers or doctors , who are not trained for the psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current of the cir@@ cus .
&quot; already for over 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family . &quot;
so the gift to delight is the family in the blood .
&quot; we are important to take away people from their everyday life and take them for two hours to take into a completely different world , stres@@ ses the 27 years old boy . &quot;

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sizes Steph@@ anie mother , Brigitte . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus , are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations . &quot;
&quot; Steph@@ anie is also taking position : &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , it is also not good . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; four @-@ leg@@ gy Arti@@ sts , as they are lov@@ ingly called , is not read by the eyes every wish . &quot;
we want to cooperate with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel good , it does not want to go into the ring . &quot;
this top commandment therefore : good for the animals to care .
&quot; especially on their z@@ eb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a cross@@ bar , the family is proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived for eight years in a sal@@ ary and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our little Jum@@ bo as &quot; , &quot; tells Brigitte . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus . &quot;
this is the reason for every visitor to be part of it .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie &apos;s : &quot; &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spect@@ ators , we always give our best and are happy with all my heart . &quot;

Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25 000 to 30.000 jobs in the framework of corporate restructuring and saving efforts at the services of the company .
HP will subsequently split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing business hardware and its service business activities .
&quot; the expected job super@@ structure leads to a burden of over 2,@@ 7 billion dollars as of the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chair and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit according to separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise becomes smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ening portfolio of shops , which support companies at a transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better placed than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US $ annual turnover and &quot; &quot; will be focused on delivering so far @-@ reaching , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s by gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill , and Dave , and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has got a massive restructuring to cope with the conversion from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers and one of the largest US @-@ tech company , is the latest in this field , based on conviction that closely focused enterprises will get a better performance . &quot;
FC arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that teamwork can stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the ver@@ ted Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed on Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes to plan , there &apos;s no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is certain that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history its involvement in the next summer is certainly still un@@ certain .
&quot; the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere has ended the last season after a separate an@@ kl@@ ist infringement , and then again came back to his old weak@@ ening during the season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ening the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , which is not well healed . &quot;
this is not a major matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in conjunction with its buttons or with the injuries that he had previously .
&quot; this may be true of purely medical point of view , but like a man@@ ger also recognized , there are the related risk of further injuries , always if a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd shed 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 from Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ ure in the last five seasons .
the broader image for arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rates during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you return from a injury , you have a decent period of time , a time in which you must boost your body and win a combat force . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope to stabili@@ ze his body , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening for Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur on coming Wednesday and winding poses a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not move to Croatia what means to start Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Th@@ eo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it , a small fri@@ c@@ ep@@ rint , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
although arsen@@ al clear favourites are to be allowed by group F the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is among the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ i@@ dation effects in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; Un@@ defe@@ ated &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , with the jud@@ g@@ ala Palace 3 . &quot;
this year was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; it is the opinion that arsen@@ al brought the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and will remain from distant hope , with his management to lead the association at his first Europap@@ l@@ end tri@@ umph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
there has never been out of arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show which gave us serious lessons for men @-@ friendly
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need@@ ing for men to open themselves , now even more des@@ perate than ever , such as self @-@ ass@@ ination among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important deaths among men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more pre@@ valent in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ man ( calm - campaign against a her@@ itable life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture in question , the men refuse to seek assistance if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the center@@ piece in the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms presented that when the suff@@ erer had a enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not depres@@ sed , hal@@ ves a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have only to have friends so as to make a friendship .
&quot; in the age of more than social media in communication , with its focus on style on substance is the immedi@@ acy of the answer often more important than a significant contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to be strong , vital and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist extr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy . &quot;
the Beautiful at Friends was that this foc@@ uss@@ ing has been put on the head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , defined by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ugs , moments in the football club and the lon@@ ging from Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can refer to each case , even if they often ref@@ rain to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telephone calls to me , ... &quot; My listen to the role of people who feel depres@@ sed and sel@@ fish , has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the males who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old re@@ use &quot; I come &quot; &quot; with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact as the feeling that it is perceived as weaknesses if you are talking about problems . &quot;
&quot; Friends is one of the shows , which comes to me in mind if I try to offer long @-@ term admir@@ ation mechanisms . &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my object @-@ oriented state about the phone the people in moments of desp@@ air also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Festival with the celebration of the day entirely new designed scenery why do not then take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
&quot; or , even better , if you could walk around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone give him a smile and tell him hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning - the whole 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Festival
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to get Malmö
Angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani according to his hits against mal@@ m@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to generate in Malmö .
here are the play report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain its Champions League Season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the prince park stadi@@ on on Tuesday started .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G players who brought the French champion in the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities , before they finally missed their lead , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a header . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish Masters , as they do not only strive for the qualification for the K@@ .O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later started in the game against his home town team and against the association with whom he began his illustrations in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win over to our opponents face problems and look back , even if there are certain things we have to say in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to gain and we won even though I regret that we haven &apos;t sc@@ ored one or two further gates .
&quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury to one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold on the weekend a 2 : 2 have decided to hold on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argentin@@ ean wing@@ ed was referred to as the man to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he moved to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malmö defense , before he carried into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , anyone believed that PS@@ G would be a big win that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic struck in a Play @-@ off hit , to achieve this stage , when an@@ gling with nine nationalities were sitting on the field and was faced with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field one harder opponent . &quot;
&quot; but except one shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad results , not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was not less than five trials alone in the first half and then abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had appointed him after the rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he dism@@ is@@ sed a lot more skill , when he turned his fellow @-@ players into the play , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria in a turning point , which was distr@@ acted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the p@@ edge ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay ay@@ er achieved his sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had folded a left wing of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all thoughts to return to Malmö to the game , and only an excellent input of sav@@ age from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result , before sp@@ amm@@ ers E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi a door was completed at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ im , gave later to that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
since then we played only in the Swedish League that did not have the same level .
the qualification @-@ games are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
world and Europ@@ am@@ eister X@@ avi plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern has obviously been a few years ago , before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which at the time played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times kno@@ ck@@ out champion , four times champion @-@ League , two times club @-@ champion , two times Europ@@ champion , one time World Champion - the title @-@ list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;

and the registered result of FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi fail
but the change did not come up .
and the decisive man today works for the German record Master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .

matt Dam@@ on playing diversity in film coverage
&quot; matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ o American fil@@ mm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said , she won &apos;t need behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a row from Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , considered this the need for alternative perspectives , and in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists at the selected screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about variety , then do it in the cast of film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
brown re@@ formed sho@@ cked with un@@ ques@@ tioned un@@ belief and called &quot; hol@@ o ! Wow . okay . &quot; than the comments of the acting by The Mar@@ tian &apos;s fir@@ mer .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Produ@@ cers of Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the character of Harmony , &quot; &quot; he first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te , which is be@@ aten by her white be@@ der . &quot;
the producer of De@@ ar White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on arous@@ ed something that their director at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion has been scre@@ ened , explo@@ ded the Social Media before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ ons comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter @-@ users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip , by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO , that it hur@@ ts does . &quot;
&quot; the Twe@@ et bur@@ ns more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on comments come at a time when the precise racial representation in the media is at the top of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown became killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter prev@@ ails and authorities , discri@@ min@@ atory practices against d@@ inning . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a attachment to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums silent matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums are still growing their importance . &quot;
&quot; in younger time , the movement of the Movement Black Li@@ ves have published an explanation and may be regarded as a reaction to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ Person@@ alize Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck whether the group should be regarded as a H@@ ass @-@ group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leader . &quot;
&quot; recently announced that Dam@@ on was found on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media agencies , who are invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; whether he accepted the invitation or she has already met the Pope , is un@@ clear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American N@@ inja Warrior &apos;s Gre@@ enland 1 Champion
&quot; professional sports , current and servic@@ ing Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American N@@ inja Warrior on Monday night and took the Grand Prix at 1 million $ with home . &quot;
&quot; the competition show that concluded just off their 7th season had never experienced a competition competition , which could close all stages of its obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , to the Fin@@ als . &quot;
the last task was belon@@ ged to climbing to a 75 minute walk @-@ rock climbing in 30 seconds .
&quot; pro@@ gres@@ sing the task within the period that he completed the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 from American N@@ inja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge a full three seconds more quickly , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with e ! messages after the hard battles victory , still under the shock over the gain of the Great prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or to life &quot; &quot; said Isaac . more than his p@@ ile money . &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why B@@ ritten , although he ended the course at all , does not get any prize money . &quot;
according to the rules the money is transferred to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than a fin@@ alists , it receives the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and changed the life he gets the magnificent Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has triumph@@ s about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
&quot; mass of awards , he received from fans . &quot;
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt just as if they were cast@@ ed the roles .
&quot; America N@@ inja Warrior was extended for a 8th season , the fil@@ ming will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ ce of Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stood on the last square in the American League Central . &quot;
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a bo@@ iler and played this part perfect on Tuesday perfect against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the T@@ wins spent a chance of Ascension within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League .
&quot; Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F word that was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad ou@@ m . &quot;
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon gave off his early offensive support when Detroit proved three times in the first two b@@ ings once again in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times to the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three rings .
it was just his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year greatly , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at the bull@@ bar each game , and therefore I want to concentrate completely into the game . &quot;
&quot; the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ ed tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ra@@ vine , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has the sm@@ el@@ wood well curved , &quot; said m@@ n . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( head@@ training ) , saw distinc@@ tly better off in the bull@@ bar , and brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three vines at the end of the seventh inner , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double at the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ ding Aaron H@@ icks reached a leg and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Lef@@ th@@ anded Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy ran wall , the only man , with whom he was faced , before the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ stroke Miguel S@@ ano , which was running the rect@@ angle Rot@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of run@@ ners and the completion @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen to the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a Double Play . &quot;
it was this in the Major League leading 27 times during this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe suggested a double Play
after Detroit created an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth angle , a R@@ BI double with the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ do and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed people S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth report . &quot;
Detroit benef@@ ited as the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game from an even not movable Phil H@@ ugh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three rings in the first two b@@ ings against the right @-@ stand of the veter@@ an , was removed before the play of the viol@@ ability list , after he was missing for more than a month because of a back of back . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning , which I wished for me , &quot; said H@@ ugh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt com@@ for@@ ting when I started again and noticed that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches here in the third time . &quot;
&quot; after having been at the first Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ bat@@ ter , Hus@@ appointed a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game that got a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed its 0 @-@ 21 track series with the Run@@ es in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , created a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was cast out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which the threat ended . &quot;
the tig@@ ers put on the second hand made an one @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
he didn &apos;t particularly wor@@ e . but he has caught the right place .
H@@ ugh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count not sc@@ ored any points in the third in@@ ning before it replaced by the Rel@@ i@@ ever right@@ igh@@ ter A.@@ J.@@ Ach@@ ter .
&quot; at H@@ ugh@@ es , there are three hits of six hits and a walk with four strings . &quot;
ann@@ ot@@ ations : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez has ex@@ pi@@ red for a violation of the wor@@ ship@@ pers .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder @-@ Den@@ ise in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ chez , since mid August on the injury list due to a shoulder @-@ rung , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
with San@@ chez from the game the L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the viol@@ ability list is can@@ cel@@ ed to start against the T@@ wins .

&quot; the director of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe , the arbit@@ ration thinking about military action must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he thre@@ aten the European states &quot; collective path . &quot;
four years ago he had been glad that the Kel@@ ch of a military participation in Germany had gone .

Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
so far the EU states have not been able to agree on a common procedure in the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) with a special meeting to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refuge@@ e sand@@ ran@@ gs in Germany , the federal government wants to strengthen the countries of the first @-@ up and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the covenant will be held together with the countries , announced Merkel at the late afternoon evening after nearly four hours of consultation with the Prime Minister in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor &apos;s office in Berlin . &quot;

&quot; but who do not have a lead @-@ perspective , could not remain in Germany . &quot;
this belief was expressed in the round of impressive .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed , the state as a whole , now calls for a &quot; huge strength &quot; effort . &quot; &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees are now stuck on the beam route .
Hungary had closed its 175 km long border to Serbia on the night .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther place
there is now some 500 years after the Reformation in Rome .
&quot; in the presence of the President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday an previously un@@ named place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill , was bapti@@ sed to the name of the German Re@@ fund . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ ans of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right in the old Rome next to the Colos@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing was taken from the working of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , Par@@ ish of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , re@@ minded that Protest@@ ants were in the city of the Pop@@ es over the centuries as a minority to live only in the hidden her faith . &quot;
with the square I will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome be welcome .
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) proved to be a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the annual sol@@ sti@@ ce 15@@ 10 / 11 some months in Rome .
he received the city at that time as a matter of sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions from the histori@@ ans would be encouraged by the histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .

hammer artists inv@@ ests three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ gold ) Dorn@@ en@@ one is one of the major works , the Oth@@ mar Alt for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ r@@ ust has written and updated texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that is now published with superb pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the picture was formulated for Ot@@ mar alto , who formulated over 150 motives for paper and canvas on paper and canvas . &quot;
its &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has given the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equal to &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics can be quite dark . &quot;
about three years Ot@@ mar Alt works on his bi@@ ble @-@ project for which he has met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books .
&quot; the cycles were created by cycles , which are subject to topics like Kreuz@@ weg , Pl@@ agues , Command@@ ments or fa@@ ther@@ land . &quot;
&quot; thus , he has spont@@ aneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation , just as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books . &quot;
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost who domin@@ ates himself on the basis of painting with the respective Bible views .
&quot; he is interpreted by Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible points , and so into the Today , translated into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
they are embedded between the original scrip@@ ture of Martin Lu@@ ther and each of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts on each situation here .
the master@@ piece has Golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ olds allow a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately at all trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , born in Wer@@ nig@@ ero@@ de and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who have belon@@ ged to the strict Protest@@ ant rulers . &quot;
&quot; so the education happened already with the tube , &quot; re@@ minded of Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work that , in order to bring me again to the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to keep track of art in a fast time : &quot; &quot; the perception of images is characterized today by re@@ cl@@ ame , and that &apos;s loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is passed down .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures have always something mysti@@ cal and are not decorative .

&quot; I think that is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification .
&quot; in principle no one can say , it doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must be of every single interest to get this subject to a grip , &quot; says DF@@ B @-@ boss Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will be intensi@@ vely concerned with the refuge@@ e situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and became the State of Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; this topic certainly will play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can help and wants to help .
but the decisive past@@ ure needs to be the policy .
this German Bundes@@ liga has therefore extended its refuge@@ e authorities &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we have ensured that this program runs up to 2019 , &quot; said N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some of the Bundes@@ liga team support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 pros provided a clear sign when they take place on the left Tri@@ kot@@ ge instead of the otherwise usual sponsor@@ ing logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &apos; We will help - # of a welcome .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only play , &quot; &quot; stated ceremony in the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; Zeitung on Tuesday ) and proved the project as &quot; &quot; sel@@ f@@ eit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refuge@@ e drama goes every one , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we so@@ ccer game , no , we need to use our strength to help our impact and our ways to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ revealed : Peter Ret@@ ard@@ ly spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
at the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication game against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women cap@@ tiv@@ ate 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach identifi@@ es the support for refugees as a &quot; &quot; a large communal network of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license could have started its own projects in its places .
just as great is that tiny and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; that we have spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , the association is jointly with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government with a capacity of 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already announced the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; said N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Re@@ ef loses an eye in accident
&quot; the Managing Director of Europe &apos;s greatest software Group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has shown that many reports may be lost by the fall of July in early July . &quot;
&quot; when the accident at the stairs at the House of his brother in the United States he was fallen for midnight on a water glass , which he carried in his left hand , shows the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ached , it was power@@ less , then turned out into the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ founders H@@ asso Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; but , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can but go down to his work . &quot;
&quot; in early October we meet at the meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; commented on . &quot;
the 54 years old manager be at the meeting and &quot; fully viable . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to launch the software group . &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman H@@ asso Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes usually between Germany and the USA , but since the summer time he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s important to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen as something . &quot;
important is to be up again if you like .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Sp@@ ares Magn@@ us apart from skir@@ m@@ ish ...
&quot; Magn@@ ets t@@ wit@@ ter@@ te a suitable photo and declared , he suffered the injury to be thrown by the wheel . &quot;
he therefore gets little as a reserve driving in Singapore at the weekend Fernando Al@@ on@@ so Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button has the same way a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes to make a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League .
the pace of the National Bundes@@ liga is also missing in the du@@ el of the Bundes@@ liga by the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 o / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us am on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ play against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach was open : &quot; we expect a return of him into the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el is not only changing his gene@@ tics position not just at the re@@ us position . &quot;
he announced a change on the door@@ way .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of the tri@@ ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; pra@@ ising the football teacher the world champion . &quot;
&quot; whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller comes to use in all Europe @-@ League games for use , tu@@ ch@@ el made , however open . &quot;
with a high degree of probability it will be the second game .
&quot; the resear@@ ching statement from fellow @-@ players Re@@ us , that the final decision for BV@@ B in the Europe League will be the target , keeps the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for re@@ trac@@ eable : &quot; &quot; this lies Marco not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to gra@@ b the title .
Rob@@ oter@@ au@@ tos : government wants the leading role in Germany
Germany must be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner after the will of the Federal Government in the course of the car .
&quot; the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , decided on Wednesday an Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ or from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) , which has inter alia investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Dobr@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt am edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; new mobile &quot; &quot; era &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the automated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and provide for less jams .
the subject also aims to discuss the subject with its counter@@ part among the G@@ 7 states that are also related to representatives of the industry on the I@@ AA .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Department of Transport empha@@ sizes among others the significance of the mobile broad@@ band le@@ ad@@ der and a five @-@ level up@@ stream on digital radio .
the testing of new technology currently creates a test circuit on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; no extra charge risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government aims to examine the legal framework conditions &quot; and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to employ around internationally for the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars of 10 to 130 km @-@ kilometres . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to use the Federal Government for a change in the Vienna Convention to present only the people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; by automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data within seconds .
according to a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving tests will be technically possible at motor@@ ways up to 2020 . &quot;
nevertheless the vehicle &apos;s vehicle on public roads is not expected to be expected only after 2020 .
&quot; the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Federal Republic of Germany , the authors of the study are appreciated by the study of about 8.5 billion euros in 2025 . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the PK@@ W@@ s can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport of Bart@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the security of personal information of the drivers must be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; yet , the German Self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are sc@@ ep@@ tical - a lot more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA pre @-@ specified survey of the For@@ sa @-@ Institut on behalf of the test results DE@@ K@@ RA will come to the result , that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonom@@ ous vehicles are expected in the coming ten years , 31 percent do not believe in it , 31 percent do not believe in it . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the in@@ quired to 2025 with autonom@@ ous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ driven vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the bit@@ or bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent would agree to control the control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway one could introduce the in flowing traffic at least 15 percent , in con@@ ges@@ tion 45 percent . &quot;
virtually every v@@ ated would leave the car under no circumstances under no circumstances .

the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a giant @-@ loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys enjoyed it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strongly enough , even without Tim@@ o the title to pick up the title , &quot; &quot; said Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ead during the EM @-@ teacher in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; yes , B@@ oll was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term hired spot in China . &quot;
the 34 years old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Tim@@ o is the draw@@ back , we are now no longer such a clear Favor@@ it , &quot; &quot; explained Single @-@ champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who carries the or@@ et@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , re@@ minded of the EM 2013 in Shanghai . &quot;
&quot; back then Tim@@ o has also been missing , and we are Europ@@ am@@ eister . &quot;
&quot; because of this we should be oriented , &quot; explained the world @-@ list @-@ list . &quot;
the English football @-@ player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United had a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant !
it is a mix of very big fashion show and a qui@@ p@@ aw@@ ns n@@ ace : the Designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins , which look thanks to video proj@@ ections , stim@@ ulating human . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations from the French designer , which was among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits for the great star of the mo@@ c@@ ene - and so that he put men in it . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have wh@@ is@@ sed hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be very easy , now it is genuine , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which was seen from the 18th sept@@ ember on the Kuns@@ PO @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a bit of luck that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ ver has changed his beginning and has changed his beginning . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been against it , for : &quot; for me an exhibition played a little to death &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the Museum . &quot;
previously the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dres@@ ses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into that &apos;s barely even over@@ looking work of the man , the Mo@@ de@@ story without ever having a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically is not constructed , but it is an outstanding ch@@ oreo@@ graphic &apos;s work , for which much effort was run : to refres@@ hes the doll@@ s , for example is a sty@@ list engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material have sh@@ ear@@ ed the movers according to specification of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the October legend was a special treat : a leather tro@@ ll@@ ey out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are sm@@ arter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy is in the exhibition to see .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ni@@ city of designers . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a d@@ oll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
I then throw away from Mode and brought them to himself .
&quot; he sto@@ dy Mo@@ de@@ zeit@@ manus@@ cri@@ pts , and saw the dr@@ afts of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich reg@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; but later I bought it , but of course . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the Models .
&quot; they were nothing , thir@@ sty but the mon@@ am@@ ot@@ tos . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion niche
earlier it went to the long em@@ bro@@ ider@@ y machines in and around pl@@ ush therefore to make meters .
&quot; the trac@@ ed substances and tips emerged in a large amount for customers , which they worked on for blankets and sheer curtains . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , CEO of the Mo@@ ris@@ er Pl@@ ys . &quot;
instead the fashion is again important .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip , Mode played a major role , then has been pushed back through the home textile industry and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : head in jewelry , accessories such as bags and with regional trays . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode which re@@ jects itself in past styl@@ istic er@@ as , an increasing customer &apos;s potential . &quot;
&quot; who is not served in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer on the market . &quot;
for us they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ ris@@ itze Pl@@ ys is together with nine further companies member of the trade association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Emb@@ ro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of its revenues have been set . &quot;
private dealers and wholes@@ ale shops are almost no longer available .
our products can hardly reach our customers this way .
&quot; nowadays , the mass goods are produced a lot cheaper today in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; he also weak@@ ly the export , current to Russia and the US . &quot;
there were enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association tries to score on environmental awareness , such as Cor@@ d@@ ula Bauer of the nit@@ ude stein in Fal@@ ken@@ stein said , &quot; this year we lead a quality seal that shows that we produce ecological and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt complet@@ es : &quot; this also refers to the used materials . &quot;
gradu@@ ates Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger outside of the West@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische college Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on em@@ bro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to continue the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories that have to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design can often be easily modified to keep a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago Tex@@ til@@ design@@ erin Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historic snow @-@ top new .
&quot; thereby , the machine caught on several places small chic@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold coins in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach , had already inspired from it : &quot; previously , I was able to do nothing with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
&quot; now , they use the snow @-@ tip for your jewelry . &quot;
in an elaborate process it character@@ ises the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; she also supplies to the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers , whose ancestors have lived in Pl@@ ys and surroundings and would like to have a reminder of memory . &quot;
&quot; so , I see my jewelry as the modern amb@@ assador of the pl@@ ast@@ ener tip . &quot;
Disney plans a new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film

&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , it is not about a re @-@ fil@@ ming , but to be a kind of continu@@ ance that 20 years after the first film played with the magical n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ ann@@ ie with the Banks Banks in Times of the World Economic crisis in England .

XI ur@@ ges the economy to open wider for the world
&quot; the economy has to open up broader ways to further growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should push for this to improve foreign investment and know @-@ how , and to improve the strategies needed for business ups , &quot; &quot; he said in an emphasis on the 16th meeting of the central management group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote and promote reforms , strengthen new momentum and vitality , and offer new place for economic growth , &quot;
&quot; the executive group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regul@@ ating the market process , relaxation of border controls , promotion of state companies ( SO@@ E ) , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the resident @-@ Mel@@ des@@ system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement a negative list is generated , the sectors and companies identified to not come into question for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually advanced and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of significance , as it refers to the market to a greater role in the allocation of resources , a legally state business environment and designed the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also take control of the powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how to carry out their business .
&quot; the statement also said that China border areas will permit , to explore new models from cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; in the context of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment , and will safeguard the right interests of foreign finance and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by being optimized and facilit@@ ated the application process . &quot;
&quot; the law of lawyers guarantee to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , also discussed during a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting also Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as were reported in one after the published declaration . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cur@@ y @-@ bor@@ dered in smoking @-@ fish
the European Commission plans to double the limits for mer@@ cur@@ y in larger smoking fish and the consumers with a significantly higher dose of nerve injury .
&quot; the consumer organization Food@@ watch , which is an important working paper of the EU , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the plans are cris@@ s : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects mis@@ led industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve @-@ toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish are raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cur@@ y per kil@@ ograms of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly charged with mer@@ cur@@ y , that on the basis of the still applicable limits about 50 percent of the length can not be sold . &quot;
&quot; upon dou@@ bling of the thres@@ hold values , if only 14.@@ 5 percent would be dis@@ proportion@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in return for this attrac@@ ting , the EU wants to reduce the limits by Food@@ watch the limits for other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to a 0.1 milli@@ gram of Mercur@@ y per kil@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ watch describes this but as &quot; trick &quot; , &quot; because smaller gra@@ y@@ fish , like e.g. car@@ p usually are so low , that they already keep the planned top values today . &quot;
&quot; lowering in the case of bul@@ let is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dence of the distr@@ action , which alone is helping the economy , &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt &quot;
Mercur@@ y is a po@@ ison@@ ous weight@@ y for the people that have highly evolved over the food chain in particular in smoking .
&quot; the Federal Government is therefore war@@ ned that &quot; &quot; already small amounts are especially cause for the bor@@ ns of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs is explained on its homepage with regard to current legal levels , but that a &quot; health threat of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
Mercur@@ y is driven primarily by the consistency of the environment .
&quot; according to a written report from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the German Bundestag ann@@ o@@ unding Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock is over six tonnes of mer@@ cur@@ y in the year , two thirds of the total @-@ made total . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cur@@ y in fish around the Elbe , the Rhine and the Danube is &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; , &quot; quoted the &quot; mirror &quot; in March from the paper . &quot;
last year cross @-@ wing war@@ nings before mer@@ cur@@ y in fish has already been the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F .
