&quot; I concentrate on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to define provisions on imports of Ham@@ mel - , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community relating to the use of common market organisation for sheep and goat meat , as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cool@@ ed Ham@@ mel - , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ place 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common tariff tariff ) ; &quot;
&quot; frozen Ham@@ mel - , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ place 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the common tariff tariff ) . &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for Ham@@ mel - , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amount : &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure a flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Uruguay , by suitable method to ensure that the aforementioned annual amount did not exceed and in accordance with conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change of the Offer is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the under number 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protection clause to bear , it is obliged to bear the concern that the access of the access to the common market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the deposits made from Uruguay in one year exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to exp@@ ose the ro@@ wers from Uruguay for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the creation of the goods produced by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ set of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when joining the Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay will change the number 2 fixed quantity according to the extent of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ischen trade with any new Member State . &quot;
the export bur@@ dens for these new Member States shall be determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this is carried out under the number 5 called the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ erium .
&quot; the total quantity is fixed at number 2 , with the date of Greece &apos;s accession to the community on 5 800 tons of battle weight . &quot;
&quot; the community takes everything to avoid a market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an Ham@@ mel and L@@ amm@@ ite on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community meets the measures to prevent the sales of intervals of frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an Schaff@@ hausen . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of equipment or other funding measures for the exp@@ ulsion of certain living ov@@ ine and lam@@ bs only takes place at prices and conditions , which are in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of community trade in these products . &quot;
these terms are specified in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the design and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal customs - and trade agreement . &quot;
Uruguay ensures compliance with this agreement in particular that it is issued within the quantities specified in this agreement for the number 1 mentioned products in this agreement .
&quot; the community ple@@ dges to meet all necessary measures , so that the classification of entries for the above @-@ mentioned products is made dependent on the origin of a export licence , which is issued by the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an government . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the implementation of the law , the competent authorities of the competent authority of the community at regular intervals have been issued , for the export license , and these data may be applied according to identification . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is applicable to the territories where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and according to the provisions of the Republic of Eastern Europe , on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Eastern Europe . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to announce them with a notice period of one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be examined by the two parties in front of 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes they are needed . &quot;
I would be grateful if you confirm the consent of your government with this letter .
