this document is a summary of the European Public Public Holidays report ( EP@@ AR ) which is explained as the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) conducted the studies in order to achieve recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package management ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ ons ( tablets , which can be dis@@ solve ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res of thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not available ) , distr@@ ust and ins@@ ulated , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of normal tur@@ istic mood ) inter@@ mitt@@ ent with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe to severe man@@ ic episodes , and in the prevention of Man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
the inj@@ ecting solution is applied to the rapid control of gest@@ ures dis@@ rup@@ tions or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; with both disorders , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ tes in patients who are preparing the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines , which are exactly like Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le seems to be mainly considered &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters works to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , whereby psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms will be reduced and their re@@ vis@@ ing shall be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the re @-@ occur of symptoms , was investigated in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ surgery dol , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and plac@@ ebo that had been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients when the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder affecting by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients , investigated on the treatment . &quot;
the company also led studies by examining how the body receives the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ tes and the solution to dis@@ integrate .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who were Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; when used for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy in four of the five spa studies are more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the re@@ plac@@ ements of Man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients , and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms un@@ disturbed and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , dro@@ pping ( tre@@ m@@ ness ) , nav@@ al ( tre@@ m@@ ness ) , inf@@ alli@@ ation ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , ruin and anxiety , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleep ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) was the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes have opposed to the treatment with Ari@@ ium pra@@ zo@@ le .
&quot; furthermore , the committee came to the result that the advantages of the injection solution in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with some episodes in bias @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable to predomin@@ ate the risks . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission was divided by the European Commission of Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the In@@ struction of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the whole European Union . &quot;
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ quit@@ ous episode and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day with an adult dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; an increased efficiency with dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or com@@ bin@@ ations ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ osis I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initi@@ al@@ dose should be considered if clinical factors are considered this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor is set out of the Com@@ bin@@ ational therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ e@@ zo@@ le dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the appearance of su@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; results of a epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased addiction risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le should be used with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ogen@@ ic diseases ( m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ ants ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with bloody crimes ( including acoustic and mal@@ ign@@ ing form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ese : in clinical studies , one year or less continuous , there were occasional reports of during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le Dy@@ na@@ ines@@ y . &quot;
&quot; if at one with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ lli@@ on , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient developed signs and symptoms that pointed to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic manifestation , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ le was supposed to be associated with patients with var@@ ic@@ ence in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or states that are associated with cr@@ amped accidents in connection with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le in patients with psych@@ osis who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , an elevated eu@@ ber@@ cul@@ ko compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; there was however in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the occasion for unwanted zer@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le patients treated . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there is no precise risk assessment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , which allow direct compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in regards to a deterioration of glu@@ cose levels . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic diseases , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le on the central nerve system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with a super@@ imposed side effects such as Se@@ ding ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the Res@@ or@@ p@@ tions@@ rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , with this effect however as clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers boo@@ sted a high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le around 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects , and therefore similar dosage should be made . &quot;
&quot; at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the joint application can result with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ alli@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should predomin@@ ate the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ oline and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects , and therefore similar dosage should be made . &quot;
&quot; after exp@@ ose the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the dosage level before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ anist &apos;s concentrations .
&quot; clinical studies showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le per day no significant effect on the met@@ amorph@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ le ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ p@@ hic ) . &quot;
the patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or to plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety of people and due to the concern during animal studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , patients should be warned of hazardous machines , including fuel vehicles to serve , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side @-@ effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks entered in patients who were treated with arias ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) from EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) from EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Hal@@ in@@ son@@ ism ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under the gl@@ oss @-@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bias @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under Hal@@ surgery dol treatment .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term study phase over 26 weeks during a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; a comparison between the people &apos;s groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine parameters occurred , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enhancements of the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le patients treated compared to 2.@@ 0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ing neurological syndrome , late neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome and coron@@ ary confin@@ ement , und@@ es@@ irable events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
clinical studies and market launch have been un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ le zol alone in adult patients with estimated cans of up to 12@@ 60 mg and no deaths observed .
&quot; in fact , no information on the effectiveness of a her@@ modi@@ fying lens with Ari@@ pi@@ le is present ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ y@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of use is because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le has a high plas@@ map@@ rot@@ um . &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ stro @-@ I disorder is convey@@ ed over the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ or and the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and for H@@ ist@@ amin H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .
&quot; in the hub of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le in doses from 0,5 up to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , the Pos@@ it@@ tery @-@ E@@ missions showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recept@@ or lig@@ ament , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the coup . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 schiz@@ ophren@@ ia in comparison to plac@@ ebo a statis@@ tically significant increase of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a semi @-@ controlled study was in week 52 the proportion of the Res@@ p@@ onder patients who kept an attack on the study medication , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le 77 % and half surgery dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values in Mess@@ enger , which were defined as a secondary school potential , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery as@@ mine scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at semi @-@ operates . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks to stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the back rate that was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le Group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a gl@@ oss @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients were concerned and in which the primary school potential &apos; weight gain &apos; was to decrease at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage about 3 weeks with patients with an man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ blical or mixed episode of the Bi@@ a@@ pra@@ zo@@ le showed an opposite plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks in reducing Man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with an man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ blical or mixed episode of the Bi@@ av@@ pra@@ zo@@ le in contrast to plac@@ ebo no superior efficacy .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active non @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with an man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ al @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic Mer@@ cury , Ari@@ pi@@ le showed a compared to plac@@ ebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a clu@@ e effect that was comparable to the li@@ thium or semi @-@ surgery dol a week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ ium pra@@ zo@@ le also reported a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ie on like li@@ thium or semi @-@ operates .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with an man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ al @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partially over 2 weeks do not reflect on li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy in therapeu@@ tical symptoms in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;

&quot; based on in vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for stretching and hydr@@ ation of Ari@@ ium pra@@ zo@@ le , which is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 cataly@@ sis . &quot;
the average Eli@@ min@@ ations@@ hemisphere is about 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le with extensively excav@@ ators over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and with approximate 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ishing over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , there are no differences between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ o@@ tical investigation of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a rating specific analysis of the pharmac@@ o@@ genetics resulted in no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic affili@@ ation or the impact of the smoking on the phar@@ yn@@ oc@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le .
the pharmac@@ o@@ graphic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study at Pro@@ b@@ anden with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmaceutical function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ le , but the study embr@@ aced only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to pull conclusions on their metabolic capacities . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security @-@ har@@ mak@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tion@@ ance , degra@@ dation , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity , and the can@@ cer@@ o@@ genous potential let the prehistoric data could not recognize any particular dangers for the human being . &quot;

the effects embr@@ acing a dos@@ is@@ dependent epi@@ der@@ berry ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) at rats after 104 weeks at 20 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dosage for humans ) .
&quot; moreover , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ asis was established as a result of the exter@@ mination of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ amorph@@ osis from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C to 3@@ fold of the recommended maximum dosage dose or 16@@ - up to 8@@ 1@@ h of the recommended Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis by man based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , those in human genes were found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ le , no more than 6 % of the concentrations that were found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ all of Mon@@ keys , and lie far under the limits ( 6 % ) of in vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; at rab@@ bits , these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages which resulted in Ex@@ positions of 3@@ - and 11@@ 144 of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C in the recommended clinical max@@ al@@ d@@ osis , observed . &quot;

&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ le inj@@ ections should be ended and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le . &quot;
&quot; to boost the Res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ise the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Gl@@ ut@@ eus @-@ Maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;

the effectiveness of abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study where 460 women with metastatic breast cancer were obtained from which approximately three quarters in the previous year had an Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine .
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with abra@@ x@@ ane patients treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included . &quot;
&quot; considering the patients treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between drugs and survival in relation to the deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; against the contrary , patients showed themselves before other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that their x@@ ane is more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included medicine . &quot;
it may also not be used in patients who breast@@ feeding the silent or before beginning of the treatment low neut@@ ro@@ le@@ pers in the blood .

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a anti @-@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules , which promotes the inter@@ storage of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the exotic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ers convey@@ s the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of Plas@@ mak@@ om@@ pon@@ ents in the End@@ ot@@ hel@@ ix and within the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies was demonstrated that the presence of Alb@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el promotes the transportation of ph@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the End@@ ot@@ hel@@ cells .

se@@ amed was compared as injection into a v@@ ene within a main study with 479 patients who caused by kidney problems caused by reference problems caused by reference medicines .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before they were either oked on Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ es @-@ values between the beginning of the study and the reference period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of inj@@ ected into the skin with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined by 114 cancer patients who received a chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems caused by the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ ular values , which were raised on se@@ amed , in the same measure , as with those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the patients who continued to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of sec@@ t@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure , of which occasionally lead to symptoms of a encephalopathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , ste@@ am@@ orous head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
se@@ amed must not be used in patients who might be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting among the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this offers no allergic reactions .
&quot; the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) was the conclusion that the drug was produced in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof that the drug has been a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ et@@ ine should be based on the benefit of the respective patients , which should also consider the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are envisaged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure , as they should have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ s and v@@ ascular diseases , especially with an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it can not be excluded that in treating epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting @-@ level glo@@ omy of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an increased risk for post@@ operative / v@@ ascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven for epo@@ et@@ ine that they improve overall survival in tum@@ ors with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or dimin@@ ish the risk of tumor . &quot;

&quot; depending on how your blood pressure ( an@@ a@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will subsequently arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment , and ensure that the drug works correctly and does not exceed a specific value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses from exhaust amed between 25 and 50 kg / kg twice per week , distributed to two equal inj@@ ections . &quot;

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease affecting the bones ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high level of cargo risk ( bone bur@@ sts ) , including in patients , which have recently suffered a s@@ s@@ traum@@ atic hip , like with those falling down ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of garlic , a disease , which changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patient with hip frac@@ ture should be a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by inj@@ ecting into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of acet@@ am@@ as or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) just after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta , which can reduce in the three days after the in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pping @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is like in Z@@ ometric , a part of the data material for Z@@ ometric is used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved in the first study , and it was investigated the number of verteb@@ rates and hip sub@@ frac@@ tures over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study reports 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it has been investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the salary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ates in ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me that builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the output .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) has been reduced to 70 % compared to the patients over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , with those in plac@@ ebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture had 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days of in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tive in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who might be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
&quot; as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ades patients are subject to patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s risk , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( dra@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides informative material for physicians ready to prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients , in which the side @-@ side effects of the drug should be explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;

the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta once a year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , administration of in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; following a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ version period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently exp@@ ires low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , an Initi@@ al dosage is recommended by 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ alem or in@@ tram@@ us@@ ular vitamin D in front of the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by G@@ acet@@ one or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
patients with kidney disease ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as a limited clinical experience for these patients .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for the application in children and young people under the age of 18 , since data are missing and efficacy . &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because of these patients are limited clinical experience .
an pre @-@ existing Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ an@@ emia is to be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in front of the treatment of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the fast set of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid on bone cultivation , a temporary hypo@@ cr@@ ine can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; for patients who require dental handles , no data are available , whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate is reduced the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the ortho@@ don@@ tic area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the treating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by G@@ acet@@ one or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;

kidney disease vaccine Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney distur@@ ban@@ ces which acts as acceptance of ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing ( annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ ed@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the Ser@@ um @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after gift was treated with 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta patients with plac@@ ebo patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; based on evaluating the laboratory studies stood the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which treated below the normal spon@@ ge range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , with 2.@@ 3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies treated patients . &quot;

a micro @-@ computer graphics ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with ac@@ la@@ sta patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to plac@@ ebo an increase in weight @-@ volume and maintaining the trained bone architecture .
bone mineral marker The kno@@ b @-@ specific phosph@@ or@@ ical phosph@@ ates ( B@@ 1@@ NP ) in Ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during the duration of study .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .

B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output of up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirrors have not been tested routines , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tra @-@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the total capacity was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D on the total treatment and shr@@ ubs as at all times .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment conducted over 24 months in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % on the total control and around 4.3 % on the cap .
clinical effectiveness in men In H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study were random@@ ized and assessed for 185 patients the BM@@ D has been assessed after 24 months .
&quot; the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7,5 % with ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8,@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a different study involving men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) the once yearly appointment of Ac@@ la@@ sta related to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra @-@ BM@@ T after 24 months in comparison to the output value .

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was proved in two six months studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain and pain control compared to the output value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified at the end of the six month major study as Res@@ p@@ onder ( on the therapy ) were able to be recorded in an observ@@ atory phase .
&quot; by the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients , the therapeutic response was attended by 141 of patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 who treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients receive the following pharmac@@ o@@ graphic data that proved to be dos@@ ages independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ berries took quickly from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ time t ½ : 0,@@ 24 and t ½ 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ational phase with a tempor@@ al elimination phase with a tempor@@ al elimination period t ½ h 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and ß , with the above @-@ called ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid reset into the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clearing is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains in@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ement acid - concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma centr@@ ation against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearing by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems metabo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not yet metabo@@ li@@ zed and because it is a watch@@ dog or even more direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , inter@@ changeable In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;

this results in that an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney system up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
since for severe kidney disease ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are possible for these populations no statements are possible .

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ z@@ class that is called Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of garlic . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen , which are formed from Andro@@ s , play a role in more gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get occurs the bone structure too fast , and new bone material is set out un@@ arranged , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta works by re@@ alizes the bone structure , creating a normal bone @-@ formation and thus l@@ ends the bone again strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; when you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the patient &apos;s care if you have other medicines and used or used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs , known by which they are ashamed of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; by using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and beverages , you are worried that you can take enough fluids according to the instructions of your doctor before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ene .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta appears for a long time , you may need a further dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get can act Ac@@ la@@ sta longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta did not hesitate to contact your doctor or hospital in order to make a new appointment .
before termination of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta if you are considering the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta please take your next physician ter@@ min and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) are after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions but less frequent .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle , or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this un@@ regular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have got Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

&quot; if the drug is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage period and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently exp@@ ires low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta has two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be supplied sufficiently with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the fast set of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid on bone cultivation , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ an@@ emia develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly to at least twice daily 500 mg of calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently exp@@ ires low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 is an oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ ular vitamin D in front of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Public Framework report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained as the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) conducted in order to reach recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin diabetes ) . • It can be applied solely ( mono@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular overweight drugs ) . • It can be applied together with another sealing medication ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to Met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) can be applied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dosage cannot be satisfactory . &quot;
in combination with a Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or ins@@ ulin can be retained the previous dose of the Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ gen or In@@ sul@@ ins with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos @-@ treatment ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced the dose of the Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ anom@@ s or isl@@ anders .
&quot; this means that the physical ins@@ ulin can be improved better and the blood sugar level decreases , causing type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes to better set . &quot;
&quot; for more than 1 400 patients , the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff , in addition they received up to 3.5 years of either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood has been measured ( gl@@ yc@@ lical hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how good the blood sugar has been set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values , which makes it possible that the blood sugar values used in the application of dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were reduced . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ aire showed at a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was examined in 2@@ 89 patients , patients infected in addition to ins@@ ulin , compared to 0.@@ 14 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients , which were additionally plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic c@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis ( high ket@@ one level - acid level - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in is intended to be used in which Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 the European Commission reached the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for launching accounts in the European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , arch@@ ed and wear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the wording &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with ins@@ ulin , and in which metals are inadequate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility . &quot;
&quot; for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age are not available , therefore application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. past heart disease or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve . &quot;
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure to gain weight gain and oils when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced st@@ rov@@ ascular disease has been carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output liver pol@@ ymers ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard division ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror is increased until 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ eric values as soon as possible to control again . &quot;
&quot; if a patient developed symptoms that refer to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , appetite and / or dark@@ er har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be guided by the clinical parameters of the clinical evaluation .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain has been proven that is associated with li@@ posu@@ ction and in some cases associated with a liquid medication . &quot;
as a result of a Hä@@ modi@@ lution occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a slightly reduction in the mean hem@@ o@@ zo@@ omed values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.4 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.@@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased ins@@ ulin sensi@@ tivity , in patients , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is obtained as oral or triple Com@@ bin@@ ational therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the launch with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported on a appearance or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic macro@@ mo@@ dems with a reduction in visual ac@@ uity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ular men should be aware of the possibility of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dems , if patients report about disorders of visual ac@@ uity ; an appropriate oph@@ thalm@@ ologic evaluation should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of announcements of adverse events with regard to bone customs , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the accounting incidence amoun@@ ted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the women with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women , which were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for examination of cardiovascular events , compared to 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 0.5 % per 100 patient years ) with patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; the patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is ab@@ used ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmaceutical drugs or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duction tas@@ k@@ mer are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) result in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance , thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change of the tur@@ mo@@ ors and the brake inde@@ xes of the lens as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on occurred AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ff on the three @-@ fold of the standard division in the standard and frequently referred to as under plac@@ ebo but more often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
&quot; in an out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced st@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of a severe heart failure is less than plac@@ ebo higher than plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the launch of the market has rarely reported about Her@@ cin@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a summary of reports of unwanted events with regard to bone customs , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated in the groups with compar@@ isons treated groups . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , questionn@@ aires stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; during the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to work via a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ mel@@ d Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) , which results in the animal model to an increased ins@@ ulin sensi@@ tivity of liver , fats and skel@@ eton muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ er@@ al glu@@ cos@@ ity in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has continued for more than two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.5 % after the first 6 treatment tests ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the therapy , a blood sugar control was defined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients treated under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been inadequate in spite of three im@@ onic Optim@@ ization phase with ins@@ ulin , to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the average h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients who continued only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
in clinical studies over a year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one an statis@@ tically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ as compared to the output levels .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was examined in a small one to 18 weeks out investigation of type @-@ 2 diabe@@ tics .
&quot; in most clinical studies , in comparison to plac@@ ebo a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids , and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ D@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years of reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in comparison to plac@@ ebo met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide the total plastic gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo was found under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no statis@@ tically significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide dimin@@ ished values were observed .
in a study over 20 weeks reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only the so@@ ber @-@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de level this is both about an effect on the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption and the hep@@ atic tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ogen@@ ic Out@@ come study , 5@@ 2@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced st@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary disease in groups random@@ ized to present over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral use , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed to the top con@@ centric pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma normally 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis the contribution from M @-@ IV to the effectiveness in approximately thre@@ e@@ fold the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ Studies , that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ o@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ active distinctive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans the marker was found mainly in the thread ( 55 % ) and a lower scale in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma cutting period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is at the age of 5 @-@ 6 hours and those of the entire active met@@ alli@@ on lies at 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its meteor@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers , whereby the rates of the oral clearing of the mother &apos;s substance was similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys &quot; coinci@@ ding after repeti@@ tive administration of plasma , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric coron@@ ary hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance , thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induc@@ ed at the rat increased inci@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pl@@ asi@@ bility ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epith@@ eli@@ um .
in a animal model of the family @-@ cal@@ end@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment conducted with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons increased to an increased frequency of collagen .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the accounting incidence amoun@@ ted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the women with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women , which were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for examination of cardiovascular events , compared to 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 0.5 % per 100 patient years ) with patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
in another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in is examined by Met@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in clinical studies over 1 year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one an statis@@ tically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ as compared to the output values .
in a study over 20 weeks reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels that both have an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de absorption and the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ licence @-@ Syn@@ thesis .
&quot; although the study was missing the target with regard to its primary final point , which presented a combination of the overall , non @-@ deadly coron@@ ary coron@@ ary ar@@ dium and Rev@@ ask@@ ular@@ isation of leg arter@@ ies , lay the results close that with the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on are not associated with cardiovascular risk @-@ long @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone customs , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies have been treated with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who received pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and received more than 7.@@ 400 patients who were reported compar@@ isons in women . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c sp@@ y , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with any other human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may need to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of acet@@ ab@@ aph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes are outw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .

&quot; if a dosage is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary in the first dosage , or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions emerged after a shift from animal to human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early war@@ ps of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; traveling through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician since such trips can cause that ins@@ ulin and meals have to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
the physician must therefore consider possible interactions with therapy and their patients are always asking for other medicines .

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ all@@ ag@@ ues , including arthritis ( pains and inflammation in the joints ) or po@@ ise no@@ des ( &quot; stones ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary arm level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose can be increased once daily 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , still tox@@ ins can occur ; therefore , patients are advised to take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor further drugs for prevention of plaster . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant , as it was not investigated for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , at which 1 0@@ 72 patients were participating , the efficacy was compared to various Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with which of a plac@@ ebo ( hypo@@ medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used at a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ests in the blood during the last three measurements were under 6 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 from 262 ) of the patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg took , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once taken daily 120 mg in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; compared to that , this was in 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal liver values . &quot;
in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ du@@ es in the pre @-@ history there is also an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary plant in blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ op@@ tic leu@@ ka@@ emia diseases , which have already led to pri@@ at@@ abl@@ ag@@ ings ( including one from the medical history known or currently present plaster , and / or a gre@@ ase arthritis ) . &quot;
if the ser@@ um har@@ sh@@ saw bricks after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be considered a dosage increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , the efficacy and safety are not completely investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and young people , because there are no experiences with children and young people , the use of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group will not be recommended . &quot;
&quot; according to Organ@@ izer , the application of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases For patients with medical cardi@@ ac disease or de@@ composition of heart failure is not recommended in the treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other hard @-@ sow@@ ing medicines , it can occur during the treatment start to an acute tox@@ ins , because by lowering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ sh@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els initially can be mobil@@ ised in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine are so far outw@@ ard that it comes to a de@@ pot in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver diseases Dur@@ ing the clinical trials of phase 3 were observed light ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function in with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at patients treated ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform before the beginning of the Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ ology and in the further course depending on the clinical findings of a liver working test ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in Z@@ em@@ n were not carried out any alternating studies on Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O shirts can lead to an increase in the the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the met@@ amorph@@ osis of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; at Pro@@ b@@ anden was the simultaneous casting of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ x@@ 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in the Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ museum ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and T@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies the use of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 shirts are not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in unwanted events .
&quot; Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without that a dosage adjustment for Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the same at the same time it is required . &quot;

&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a ta@@ ci@@ du@@ ms , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de ( around 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , but does not affect any significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be closed to side effects from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental trials do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryo / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful with the taxes of a vehicle , serving machines , or in the exercise of hazardous activities , until they can be assured that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC influenced their performance . &quot;

the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ial erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ gic heart attack or a de@@ compression heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) Side Eff@@ ects , which could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and that ( check @-@ evaluation ) in connection with the medicine could be reported in all the Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups altogether more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials were not observed heavy skin lesi@@ ons or severe over@@ sensitivity actions .
7 Open @-@ time extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies have been treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year long and 53 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term study studies were similar that were reported in the studies of phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment events were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups altogether more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ time extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .
the following treatment events were reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of the Phase 3 for these cans either not reported or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ li@@ pi@@ an@@ a@@ emia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , skin lesi@@ ons , gu@@ ardian , kidney failure , kidney failure , kidney failure , kidney failure , kidney failure , rise in the blood , increase in l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ ten@@ ses , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of Pur@@ in@@ metabo@@ li@@ ism and arises in the context of reaction cas@@ cade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ureth@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a real powerful , not Pur@@ in @-@ selective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ X@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vit@@ ro shirts , located below the n@@ anom@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has been described in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ch@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary activity point was in every study the proportion of patients when the last three month had given certain Ser@@ um@@ har@@ sh@@ arks levels &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a Ser@@ um@@ at@@ in@@ value of course starts from &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed in regard to lowering the Ser@@ um@@ harm@@ ac@@ esp@@ ace under 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) which statistics used with conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed in regard to the permanent reduction of the Ser@@ um@@ harm@@ ac@@ pi@@ eg@@ els below 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statis@@ tically significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily opposite the treatment with the conventional used dosage Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with Ser@@ um@@ Cre@@ ate ( 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 5@@ 09 ) were summarized for analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
the reduction of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ sh@@ ek@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els on &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and keep up permanently on the entire treatment .
5@@ 09 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with Ser@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ duction &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
&quot; primary End@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function , the AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function ( d. h ) . &quot;
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary activity point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
there were no clinical significant differences in regard to percentage back of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in pro@@ b@@ anden ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary End@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ lei@@ c @-@ concentrations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l About 40 % of patients ( Bas@@ eline ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of the Phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 for treatment against a g@@ ame@@ ful ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a g@@ ame@@ ful ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in po@@ ison size , resulting in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the gi@@ ants up to month 24 . &quot;
&quot; higher T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5,@@ 5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also received in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ time extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
with healthy volunteers raised the maximum plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centric concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plas@@ tic@@ on@@ ec@@ centric @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multi@@ pl@@ ers of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg will be observed for Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C that is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simpler or multi@@ pl@@ ers of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.6 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clinical significant change in the percentage decrease in the ser@@ um @-@ acid centr@@ ation , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The seem@@ ing Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( v@@ s@@ s / F ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plas@@ m@@ um from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is achieved via the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg , constant . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies with human Leb@@ er@@ micro@@ som@@ en showed that this oxid@@ ative met@@ alli@@ on is predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose used in the urine as un@@ changeable Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative met@@ alli@@ on and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine also about 45 % of the dose found in the chair as un@@ changeable Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative met@@ alli@@ on and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 7 % ) . &quot;
special Pati@@ ents of kidney failure After the intake of multi@@ pl@@ ers of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure changed the C@@ max from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at not in proportion to prob@@ es with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ / h in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ . h / ml in the group with severe ni@@ v@@ ous function .
12 liver functioning out of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with lighter ( Ch@@ ild@@ - Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate severe ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication B ) . the C@@ max and AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ alli@@ its changed not significantly compared to prob@@ es with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in terms of AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its meteor@@ ites after taking multi@@ pl@@ ers of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC for older patients compared to younger pro@@ b@@ ors .

these findings are seen as a result of a specified @-@ specific Pur@@ pose and ur@@ inary tract and for clinical use as not relevant .
it was noted that Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in or@@ als cans of up to 48 mg / kg / day does not have an effect on the fer@@ til@@ isation and reproductive power of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , approximately at 4.@@ 3@@ - the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxicity , entered in with a reduction in performance and a development delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause ; a risk for a low vitamin D mirror exists .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking , or pick other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of food freight , the patient may take place until after the first food intake of the day , which should take early 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 already be used separately in drugs , which are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D reflection .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror was treated with the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than for those who only participated in Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also placed data that is needed in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE contained in Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive apparatus ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , lat@@ ency , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , sh@@ ri@@ dden abdom@@ en ( dro@@ wn stomach ) , as well as sau@@ cep@@ hal@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with et@@ ular hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
it may not be used in case of ail@@ es@@ oph@@ agus in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up at least 30 minutes .
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 the European Commission announced the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. a licence for the transfer of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the whole European Union .
&quot; capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the tear of a garlic on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only possible with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of drugs ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
following po@@ inters are to be followed just to reduce the risk of solution op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swal@@ lowed for the end of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cr@@ ush the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a exists . • The patients should not take care before the first food intake of the day that will take early 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ultim@@ us , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal blood vessels or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal in@@ al@@ tract , except with special care are given ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by solution op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cor@@ tions , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these severe and required a hospital assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that may point out to possible solution op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out , in the appearance of symptoms , pain , pain , or new or self @-@ worse so@@ d@@ burn the drug and pick up medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ic side effects seems to be raised in patients who do not take the drug correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to a solution op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all doses are given to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large landscap@@ ed clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no higher risk was established , were rarely reported ( according to the launch ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and associated with complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the p@@ ines , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regul@@ ates mostly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there is no data available to give the notes , whether the inser@@ tion of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a kie@@ ffer surgical procedure , dimin@@ ished the risk of a oste@@ opor@@ osis of the p@@ ines . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the patient doctor is decisive for the treatment planning at each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they are supposed to take the pill next morning before taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; you are supposed to take no two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
other disorders that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ smus ) should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate Food and Bever@@ ages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acid and some or@@ ale medicines can imp@@ air the Res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once they are taken at the same time . &quot;
therefore patients must wait after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific Inter@@ action studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical studies was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurred . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and therefore is neither used during pregnancy nor of breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the p@@ ines has been reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports come from cancer patients but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
&quot; however , deportation of ser@@ um @-@ calcium is to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 2.@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Ser@@ um@@ - phosph@@ ate to &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as a result of a oral over@@ dose , Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal in@@ al@@ tra@@ kt may occur in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal in@@ al@@ tra@@ kt such as stomach @-@ stomach , so@@ d@@ tis , Gast@@ ri@@ tis or Ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of 1,@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase of the intestinal remains of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and bone . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a defect can lead to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al muscles and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie and thus to a further increased risk for falls and bone bur@@ sts in oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ users continued to continue ; even the BM@@ D of the fem@@ inists and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ed controlled studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continue to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily hub of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least a new vor@@ tex by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
Res@@ or@@ ption related to a intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at for women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nights of a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
the bio@@ availability rose accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
with healthy volunteers led the hub of oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) to not a clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in funding in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies of rats have yiel@@ ded that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is distributed after intraven@@ ous hub of 1 mg / kg temporarily into wheat @-@ we@@ ars , but then moved rapidly into the bones or re@@ tired with the urine . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous cover of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at about 50 % of radio@@ active marked substance within 72 hours of urine were re@@ tired , and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the thread . &quot;

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered adult patients with which a kidney or liver transplan@@ ts to prevent a rep@@ ulsion of the transplan@@ ts by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients when the tran@@ spl@@ ant was ra@@ ging after a treatment duration of one year ( by example examined how often a re @-@ transplan@@ tation or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
&quot; in addition , temporary more studies to 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were carried out with liver transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant as well as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with et@@ ular hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tactics , macro @-@ antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) , or any of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
patients and physicians must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time using Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f since the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the same may be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should do this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ant or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ l@@ ating soup . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ tical lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ces of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the tigh@@ ter control of one in the tran@@ spl@@ ant medical devices ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic medication has to be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will remain . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ulsion and compatibility in individual cases and blood @-@ level regulations ( see below .
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley should be controlled before conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , comparable with both formulations , both at kidney and le@@ ased patients . &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ ward phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , can take an adaptation of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f tin @-@ schem@@ as several days until the Ste@@ ady State is achieved . &quot;
if the condition of the patient allowed in the first post@@ operative phase no or@@ ale intake of pharmaceuticals can be initiated the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentration at the manufacture of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
&quot; the application of the application of the tran@@ spl@@ ant repression of the tran@@ spl@@ ant must be sustained ; consequently , consequently , a maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be given . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation of pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant treatment The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dos@@ is@@ adjustments can be later needed since the Phar@@ mak@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change during the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the tran@@ spl@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation of pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant Disp@@ atch The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be changed for a tran@@ spl@@ ant of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , this change in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
Ni@@ er@@ - and liver transplan@@ tation After a switch from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day must start treatment with the recommended Initi@@ al transplan@@ tation for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation When adult patients , which are placed on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg per day once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other tran@@ spl@@ ant believe it does not have clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pan@@ gs and diseases transplan@@ ts patients in an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 8 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplan@@ ts of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day to apply . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood @-@ effects in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces a reduction of dose .
patients with reduced kidney function As the ren@@ al function has no effect on the pharmaceutical drugs of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
&quot; due to the ninth oto@@ x@@ ical potenti@@ alities of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the Ser@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ ine level , is recommended to calculate the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) . &quot;
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f At the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in based on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is advisable . ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the bottom level in full blu@@ t The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ulsion and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the state aid of full blu@@ t @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror controls .
it is recommended for frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation carried out followed by perio@@ dic controls during the conservation therapy .
&quot; blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ age adaptation , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the simultaneous use of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ power blood@@ centr@@ ation ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials allow us to conclude that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the talent level does not exceed the blood in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the bottom levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lie in full blu@@ t during the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with the patient - and hearty patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent treatment of liver disease , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts have usually been used blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to severe und@@ es@@ irable events , including tran@@ spl@@ itting , or other side effects , which may occur in a consequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or abundance . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ tical lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ces of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the tigh@@ ter control of one in the tran@@ spl@@ ant medi@@ ator ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with tran@@ spl@@ ant rep@@ ulsion which proved to be treated against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants and no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation for adult heart transplan@@ ts and tran@@ spl@@ ant in the chin @-@ age are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
&quot; due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ tic level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tactics ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other plant det@@ erg@@ ents during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood are offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , was seen as cardi@@ omy@@ opath@@ y , chamber or sep@@ t@@ hy@@ per ph@@ ony , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; further factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infection , liquid exposure and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted to the possible risk of risks due to possible clothes or use of a solar protection by means of a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who occupy the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pr@@ es such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , coron@@ ary and visual dys@@ functions should show a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ sel , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose , is provided in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intolerance , l@@ act@@ ase @-@ lack or glu@@ cose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ painting . &quot;
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies which are known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; it is therefore advisable to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at the simultaneous casting of substances , which can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust even the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly influenced interaction was made with antim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and pr@@ el@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic anti@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ prototype . &quot;
&quot; Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies , that the increase in blood levels mainly arises from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal infections . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ scale pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute abor@@ ation actions , can increase or decrease the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabolic disorders .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can lay down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus increase the hormone exposure , is particularly careful in decisions about recep@@ tive action . &quot;
the results of veterin@@ arians have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearing of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and whose half @-@ time can leng@@ then .
the results of a small number of investigations on tran@@ spl@@ ant patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ va an elevated risk of unwanted events relating to the course and result of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a supervision of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of an early birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a Hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ emia of the newborn ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the secondary profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants can often be found precisely because of the atro@@ cious disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; following the side @-@ effects after their incidence listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , not known ( incidence on basis of available data not transfer@@ able ) . &quot;

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases such as known as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants is treated with patients who are treated with tactics ( viral , bacterial , my@@ c@@ otic , gi@@ ans ) . &quot;
cases of B@@ K @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ ro@@ path@@ ia and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated leu@@ fo@@ al leu@@ fo@@ al leu@@ ko@@ enn@@ ie ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Ne@@ oplas@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - Associ@@ ated l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ pro@@ proliferation of diseases and skin tum@@ ors in connection with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high bond to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma map@@ le can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
drug mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level are likely to be convey@@ ed the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us through its bond to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ical protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enri@@ ching the connection in the cell .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ erable inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duc@@ ting due to the T @-@ cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain series of l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditioned , inn@@ ate blood @-@ treatment ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application are based on whether Adv@@ ance are applied to the treatment of ble@@ eding or the prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood @-@ related problems such as blood cells in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but after a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of the human point factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is a drug approved in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , however , is similar to that the drug does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate h@@ op@@ hil@@ lie A , including 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined by means of prevention of ble@@ eding and in surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was evaluated in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ iso@@ den with &quot; &quot; well &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; well &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ xy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ ility , or any of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission shared with Ba@@ x@@ ter AG approval for the In@@ struction of Adv@@ ance in the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy are based upon the gravity wheel of the factor VIII deficiency according to the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
&quot; in the following ha@@ em@@ atic events , the factor VIII activity in the appropriate period is not intended to sink down under the indicated plasma seal ( in % of the standard or in that time / d@@ l ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repe@@ ating until the pain and the acute impair@@ ment are removed .
inj@@ ecting every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repe@@ ating until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment process it becomes to control the dose of the inj@@ ure dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections an appropriate identification of the factor VIII of plastic caps .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to the factor VIII that can reach various in vi@@ vo recovery and have different sem@@ an@@ ties .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis of long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses between 20 and 40 is given by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plastic activity is not achieved , or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to determine a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inflation , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the administration rate should be directed after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator@@ ical activity of factor VIII targeted by Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which are classified in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positioning days is the biggest and of genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; with pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ pi@@ ous and an@@ am@@ nest@@ ly known inhibit@@ ors , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurs of ( reduced ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the her@@ op@@ hil@@ lie A in women lying above the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and l@@ ac@@ tation , no experiences before . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s in the greatest numbers of patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which were all infected with previously un@@ treated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and win@@ der ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data not transfer@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; therefore , CH@@ MP based on the basis of the security code of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months needed , decided that the approval should apply for 5 years for additional funding . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited by the Committee of Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) officially launched that the company will withdraw his application for authorization for the In@@ struction of Adv@@ ance @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the past@@ ure ( tissues , which connects other structures in the body , surrounds and bases ) of it . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that gene@@ tically modified that it can be a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; at the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which has changed so that there can be no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ant@@ ine would have to be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , and thus allow the cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made up of the non @-@ defective in the human body as an existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , for which the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company put data from a study with a patient , at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of building , into the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial documents submitted by the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP provides a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP , not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has advantages for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not note the CH@@ MP knowledge of whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered active ingredient , means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective constitu@@ ents will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hypo@@ cr@@ abs ) in patients with nas@@ al glands ( hidden nose ) in patients with nas@@ al glands ( hidden nose ) .
&quot; for adults and young people aged 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( hidden nose ) , are diver@@ ging . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be replic@@ ated by means of con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main eff@@ ec@@ o@@ stri@@ ches were the changes of the sword of the h@@ ay fever that were reported by the patient before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a default scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all ha@@ y@@ fever symptoms , besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze captured , over a decrease of symptoms to 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared to 35@@ ,@@ 9 % compared to the patient , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a allevi@@ ation of symptoms around 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patient , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( cardi@@ tis ) , or@@ der@@ mic , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nie ( sle@@ e@@ ability ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine used to treat allergies ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ angle glau@@ coma ( increased water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or v@@ ascular diseases ( hyper@@ blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ mo@@ ose ( hyper@@ function of the thy@@ roid ) or have had a risk for an ugly stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission of the company SP Europe distributed approval for the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze Agreement to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without them to break or chew@@ ing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be applied due to the lack of data to in@@ conceivable and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after dis@@ sound the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the amount of time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application can take the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time . &quot;
&quot; according to the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; da Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the drug is also contra@@ sted in patients , which are treated with a mon@@ oc@@ am@@ in@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within the 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ tic activity in a combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors , Per@@ go@@ ose , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin or other dec@@ imal rhin@@ o@@ ol@@ amin , eph@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ oline , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of these com@@ bin@@ ations were not tested for this patient collective and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for the dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for the dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about the treatment in a hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients under Digital is • Pati@@ ents with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension ( patients with hyper@@ tension ) in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to end for at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological testing , since Anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or reduce in their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been administered , however , were no clinical relevant interactions or changes in the plas@@ tik concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , there were no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
the enzy@@ me of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzy@@ me has not been identified yet so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded completely .
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ gl@@ y@@ kop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ consistency of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however , do not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison with the frequency of normal population . &quot;
&quot; because reproduction studies on animals are not always applied to humans , and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ction properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it may come to a ben@@ ign , which can lead to a impair@@ ment of the ti@@ ghtness or the ability to serve machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS Depression ( Se@@ aling , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular disease ) with possible Latvian transi@@ tions . &quot;

&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely , as well as A@@ tropical in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , P@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ency , skin tr@@ unks , and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the un@@ locking of the release of pro@@ li@@ zed cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Mast@@ ery / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ mal@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ l@@ molec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the fluid including the ampli@@ fication of subjective stro@@ kes or the tasks that are connected to the fly . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dosage was observed by 5 mg per day in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may cause further lik@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; it took 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s , whereby 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets were received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ ine efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determines the basis of the overall scores for the symptom ( except nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the fluctu@@ ating effect determined by the nas@@ al glands was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
in the context of a single dose study on the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze at healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow rate of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in day 10 was reached . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ o@@ int@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ is@@ study , which was performed with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult pro@@ b@@ anden , was found that four commis@@ sions were consumed in bad . &quot;
a component @-@ Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ Study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to gift of a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on security @-@ har@@ mak@@ ology , the toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , for the genital data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , leave no special dangers for the human being . &quot;
the combination possessed no greater toxicity than their individual components and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was in the oral gift of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ genic .

A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adult and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies with seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the Qu@@ add@@ les , number and size of the p@@ add@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and the performance of the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body @-@ up the sy@@ rup to take the solution and the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ ins in the same way , as the tablets and the application with children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; at allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us at an average decrease in the symptom ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decrease of the symptom scores after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who might be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , or any of the other components . &quot;
January 2001 the European Commission announced the European Commission for approval by A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union .
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and Persian rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies to effectiveness in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can be ended after the dis@@ end of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed with their re@@ port@@ ations .
&quot; in the Persian rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during aller@@ gens time . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in the context of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets were not noted in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been administered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced by a@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it may occur in very rare cases that may lead to a impair@@ ment of the ti@@ ghtness or the ability to serve machinery . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ side effects , which was reported more frequently than with plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side @-@ effect head@@ aches that occurred at 5.5 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and with 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a multi @-@ trial study , in which up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) were administered , no clinical relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the un@@ locking of the release of pro@@ li@@ zed cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Mast@@ ery / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the eagle molec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple sclerosis , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage administered up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statis@@ tically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ogen@@ ic effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , does not show any extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dos@@ ages study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the fluid including the ampli@@ fication of subjective stro@@ kes or the tasks that are connected to the fly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s was A@@ eri@@ us effective in allevi@@ ation of symptoms such as kidney , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching and redness of eyes as well as it@@ ching the palate . &quot;
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ ist rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Persian rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown with the overall appearance of the questionnaire to the quality of life at Rhino d@@ der@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished the burden caused by seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ ti@@ aria has been studied acting for more forms of ur@@ ti@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ology of dis@@ ology in different forms is similar and chron@@ ological patients can be more pro@@ spec@@ tively used .
&quot; as the H@@ ist@@ am@@ in@@ fre@@ is@@ isation is an important factor in all ur@@ tik@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in except for the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tik@@ aria leads to an improvement in symptoms . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dosage interval .
&quot; as in other studies involving Anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who do not re@@ acted to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka , out of the study . &quot;
an improvement of the it@@ ch to more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wax as much as it was measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variable .
&quot; in a pharmaceutical study study , in which patients demo@@ graphics are comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s -@@ Pop@@ ulation , was achieved at 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant g@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , the enzy@@ me of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ Gl@@ y@@ kop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7,5 mg made itself meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) not on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
those conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in performed clinical studies showed at a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and by Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security @-@ har@@ mak@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and for Re@@ production @-@ sto@@ x@@ icity leave the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in no particular dangers for the human being . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to allevi@@ ate the symptoms at allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and Persian rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection under 2 years ( see below section 4.4 ) and that no data are presented to support treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with an@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , in diagnosis the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examination should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children aged 2 to 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in restricted and experienced a higher pay@@ load load ( see below 5.2 ) .
&quot; the security of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up with children from 2 to 11 years , the constra@@ ined metabo@@ li@@ ze , is identical with those in children who are normally metabo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take advantage of her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glu@@ cose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose intolerance or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suff@@ ic@@ ation of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not noted in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been administered ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced with simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects among children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group like in the plac@@ ebo group .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) officially launched that the company will withdraw his application for approval by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ influenza in adults and elderly people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly persons to protect the flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the In@@ flu@@ enza @-@ A @-@ Virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a grip pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus emerges , which can easily distribute from man to man because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus as &quot; &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in contact with a grip @-@ pe@@ et of this pedi@@ gree . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins in the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as a body , dis@@ connected and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not out to fulfill the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for preventive vaccines . &quot;
&quot; should you participate in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which is caused by human immun@@ o@@ deficiency Virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which is caused by the acquired immun@@ om@@ eration syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generic is not available as a solution for admission , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic should only then be ordered when the doctor has tested what anti@@ viral medicines has taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has judged that the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily that are taken along with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ap@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , it reduces HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them on a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS not cure , however , may delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic medicines was examined in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , which had previously not been treated with decre@@ es . &quot;
&quot; this with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ generic was taken at 20@@ 6 adults , which had previously been taken by the former prototype . &quot;
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non veri@@ fi@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of the Vir@@ us@@ last after the treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who had previously been taken no prot@@ eas@@ mer , although after 48 weeks under A@@ generic more patients had a Vir@@ us@@ last less than 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ generic le@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with children reduced A@@ is@@ ase also the Vir@@ us@@ last , however , by the children who were treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants , only very few of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , which were treated earlier with prototype previously , lowered the Vir@@ us@@ load after 16 @-@ week treatment just as effective as other prot@@ rac@@ ers : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ mer resistance , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in the patient , which continued its previous protests . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ generic ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and mercy ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ generic may not be used in patients who might be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; A@@ generic may not be used in patients suffering ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or drugs , which are just as co@@ ar@@ ase and are produced in high concentrations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ase is taking , the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( alter@@ ations in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ y ( degra@@ dation of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) was the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ generic medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ generic is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ o@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the use of A@@ generic ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have a prototype previously . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally registered under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission shared the Gla@@ xo Group Limited for approval of agricultural commodities throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic medicines is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , Prot@@ eas@@ ehem@@ mer ( PI ) , treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ generic Cap@@ ase is supposed to be administered to the pharmac@@ o@@ tic boo@@ sters of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r should be carried out under consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % less than a capsule ; therefore are A@@ generic capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the increased supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generic ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ is@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data to in@@ conceivable and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ o@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver controls increased to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application is to be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disease , it is contra@@ contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ ftw@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations that contain Johann@@ is@@ we@@ eds ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to cure HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with an@@ a@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules are supposed to be applied along with low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who are suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , have increased risk to severe liver effects with potentially deadly effects . &quot;
&quot; in case of an simultaneous use of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the relevant information of these medicines . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis are showing an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ generic ason and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , which is not recommended via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , unless the possible benefits of treatment the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
since the inter@@ change of the H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 will be an simultaneous administration of an@@ al@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen not recommended .
&quot; 4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening unwanted effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the monitoring of the International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) , methods to determine the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these medicines at the same time , can be less effective because of reduced plasma bars of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r can be changed the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if even low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high prop@@ propylene gly@@ col , the A@@ generic solution to immigration is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ generic should be set for duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ rac@@ ers , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , or an exp@@ atri@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other disorders which were necessary to treatment drugs which are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ections , are reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous p@@ ha@@ em@@ ic and ha@@ em@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ isation can develop an inflammatory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial es@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immune soup , higher body mass index ) , cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ generic must not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ ftw@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be lab@@ elled together with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plasma @-@ level side effects . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to resistance .
&quot; in trying to offset the degra@@ ding plasma bar by a dosage increase of other prot@@ rac@@ er inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ we@@ eds ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient is already we@@ eds ra@@ we@@ eds , the Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r@@ attle mirror , and , if possible , the Vir@@ us@@ last decreases and the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drug is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases the cost of C@@ max by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily which show the effectiveness and imm@@ ac@@ ulate of this treatment regim@@ at@@ as . &quot;
52 % dro@@ pping if Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ ran@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it will be a tigh@@ ter monitoring , because the effectiveness and imm@@ ac@@ ulate of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; it was not carried out a pharmac@@ o@@ tic study for application of an@@ al@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but is recommended due to the imagin@@ ative component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase lie at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore the Gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z is used in combination with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) No dosage adjustment .
&quot; the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ it@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both protests . &quot;
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ eas@@ ants and existing limited data might susp@@ ect that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r may possibly sen@@ ct .
&quot; if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable to be less effective because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma bricks . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous casting of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at 193 % and therefore an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin side effects .
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is administered along with A@@ generic ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with no@@ is@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plas@@ m@@ ist of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ r@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ ol in plasma rose by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ poles ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ h compared to the value which was observed according to 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r with k@@ r@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ is@@ ase , may lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions , which are associated with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with no@@ is@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on data from other prot@@ rac@@ ers , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ ili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants , which are known as a enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of plasma bars of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ recor@@ ders such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , pine @-@ pin , ni@@ cal pin , ni@@ cal pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ generic may increase their plasma concentrations and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection related side effects , including hyp@@ ot@@ y@@ cam , ten@@ dons , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days passed away , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % bonus intervals 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous casting of no@@ is@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ cose o@@ ids , unless the possible benefits of treatment is outw@@ eigh@@ ed the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose inter@@ metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced enhancements of plas@@ m@@ um at simultaneous administration of an@@ al@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; plasma increase in these H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opath@@ y , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
it will be a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabil@@ ise the mirror since the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in general , A@@ generic mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am may not be used together with oral @-@ recorded mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while at the simultaneous application of A@@ generic mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ ent@@ alem mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prototype inserts to a possible increase in the plas@@ m@@ ist of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if even low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation given to adapt as the Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose when Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
&quot; for simultaneous casting of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ als co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ generic , an increased control over the IN@@ R ( International normal ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ any effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not predic@@ tible , therefore equally alternative methods of contrac@@ eption is recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for example ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; this medicine may be applied only after pregnancy , only after careful breakdown of possible usability for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk activ@@ ist rats , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is over@@ laid by men into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ production study of toler@@ ant rats , which was administered by em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us until the end of the down@@ time Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , showed during the down@@ time a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weights . &quot;
the further development of offspring including fer@@ til@@ isation and reproductive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r to the mother@@ tier .
the in@@ vari@@ ability of A@@ generic has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most with the ast@@ er@@ ase treatment related side effects were slightly up to moderate , occurred early on and rarely carried out to treatment . &quot;
many of these events is not clari@@ fied whether they are applied in connection with the intake of A@@ generic or another at the same time to treat HIV treatment or whether they are a result of atro@@ cious disease .
&quot; most of the side @-@ mentioned effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which with prot@@ eas@@ ed patients were not treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the test physicians and in connection with the study medication , and in more than 1 % of patients appeared , as well as under the treatment performed laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy was associated with an re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of periph@@ er@@ al and diverse sub@@ skin tissue , increased intra@@ oc@@ ular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hia of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fats . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ spect , not treated persons who were treated with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine in over a mean time of 36 weeks , was only a case ( Sti@@ ckers ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ ES , 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) at 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin lesi@@ ons were usually slightly shaped to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or macro@@ pap@@ ul@@ ant nature , with or without it@@ ching and appeared spontane@@ ously during the second treatment of treatment and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks , without having to be abandoned with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disorder or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ isation can develop an inflammatory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; received with PI pre@@ treated patients , the 600 mg A@@ generic Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were comparable ; an exemp@@ tion of side effects ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and CP@@ K values , which were received in patients infected with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently appeared . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ usement avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 protein and prevents the procession of viral and g@@ ag pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ ation , with the consequence of an education un@@ ri@@ fer , not infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in ak@@ ut and chron@@ ically infected cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ er@@ al blood ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % natural shirts ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ active patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ it@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses - like with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r bir@@ d@@ ants - the described mut@@ ations have rarely observed .
&quot; for sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ spective patients , the 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r received twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , joined 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ e . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ic distor@@ tion in the 59 closed , with prototype previously un@@ treated patients appeared , showed resistance pattern which were similar to those in adults . &quot;

&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always move the current interpre@@ tations systems to analyse the results of pesti@@ cides . &quot;
on the otyp@@ otyp@@ ic resistance based analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
companies who sell diagnostic resistance tests have clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a pesti@@ cides .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain crus@@ resistance against k@@ av@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r but generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ it@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on basis of twenty @-@ five @-@ retro@@ divided patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ it@@ avi@@ r@@ - hal@@ ted schema ( one of them pointed a limited crus@@ ade against A@@ ta@@ z@@ an@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , avi@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; in the other way , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ed @-@ resistant insulation ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
the early treatment of a ver@@ sion@@ ing therapy is recommended to maintain the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can affect the following treatment .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ is@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( 100@@ mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ nucle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ c ) with a PI , primarily with low @-@ coated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ e@@ fold virus sensitivity to A@@ generators , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI have been included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ subj@@ ection of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI Group in terms of time @-@ to @-@ violence ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks of age ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma on 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous A@@ is@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 are treated with PI .
&quot; in studies , A@@ generic solution was used to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r simultaneously ; the majority of patients treated with PI pre@@ treated patients had before at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the included patients had a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered during therapy with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; A@@ generic &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
5@@ 08 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % reduction of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) influenced by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake is influenced by the scale and rate of the Res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be adjusted to a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ riv@@ alled am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r that remains the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ due am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r remains constant , sw@@ aying percentage of free active component in dependence on the overall medical capacity in the Ste@@ ady state above the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bited or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can be administered if they are given simultaneously with A@@ generic ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gift of A@@ is@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ bush avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generic solution and A@@ generic capsules are not inter@@ changeable . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r neglected , therefore , the impact of kidney disease is likely to be low for the elimination of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ it@@ avi@@ r plasma @-@ plasma comparable to those that are obtained at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ icity with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , at male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ular du@@ es at dos@@ ages , which spoke to the 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( R@@ atte ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ cell of Adenauer and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on human beings , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , there is little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity , the bacterial Re@@ verse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , micro @-@ l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ car@@ dio @-@ bro@@ minated in human periph@@ er@@ l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ed nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver toxic can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so far , clinical trials have not been observed any significant liver toxic in patients , either during administration of A@@ generic or after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days showed both in the control and for the animals treated with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r animals , high mortality . &quot;
&quot; in a system@@ ic sculpture , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure among therapeutic d@@ osing in humans , however , were observed a number of low @-@ level changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ eton changes that refer to a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the increased supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generic ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be performed in patients with a watch@@ dog or light liver disorder , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening unwanted effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International normal ratio ) , methods to determine the substance concentration . &quot;
A@@ generic should be set in length 27 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk to a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to resistance .
5@@ 08 % increases the cost of C@@ max by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ ran@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it will be a tigh@@ ter monitoring , because the effectiveness and imm@@ ac@@ ulate of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ it@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both protests . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is administered along with A@@ generic ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 fall , although there is no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ recor@@ ders such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , pine @-@ pin , ni@@ cal pin , ni@@ cal pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days passed away , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % bonus intervals 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; for simultaneous casting of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ als co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ generic , an increased control over the IN@@ R ( International normal ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ any effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to an acceptance of AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; this medicine may be applied only after pregnancy , only after careful breakdown of possible usability for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ production study of toler@@ ant rats , which was administered by em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us until the end of the down@@ time Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , showed during the down@@ time a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight . &quot;
the in@@ vari@@ ability of A@@ generic has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in ak@@ ut and chron@@ ically infected cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ er@@ al blood ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % natural shirts ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; in the other way , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ed @-@ resistant insulation ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data should be considered during the treatment optimisation , with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; A@@ generic &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ due am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r remains constant , sw@@ aying percentage of free active component in dependence on the overall medical capacity in the Ste@@ ady state above the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bited or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can be administered if they are given simultaneously with A@@ generic ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low for the elimination of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats stood in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ular du@@ es at dos@@ ages containing the 2.@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( R@@ atte ) of exposure to humans after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on human beings , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , there is little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity , the bacterial Re@@ verse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , micro @-@ l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ c@@ ous testing , micro@@ car@@ nit@@ ine l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ine@@ ers nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days showed both in the control and for the animals treated with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r animals , high mortality . &quot;
&quot; these results allow to conclude that in juven@@ iles the met@@ alli@@ zation can still not be fully exploited , so Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the wording ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic solution to use is displayed in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , Prot@@ eas@@ ehem@@ mer ( PI ) , treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ generic solution for entry was not occupied neither with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % less than a capsule ; therefore are A@@ generic capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the patients should be , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , with taking the solution to deposit ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution is 17 mg ( 1.@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there must be no dosage recommendations for simultaneous application of A@@ generic solution to capture and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided this combination with these patients . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl engl@@ y@@ col@@ ge@@ , A@@ generic solution to participate in to@@ dd@@ lers and children under 4 years , with pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a com@@ peti@@ tive inhibit@@ ors of the met@@ alli@@ zation of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening unwanted effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to cure HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with rab@@ bits , does not prevent risk 47 of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening unwanted effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the monitoring of the International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) , methods to determine the substance concentration . &quot;
A@@ generic should be set on duration if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk to a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ medium @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ections , are reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous p@@ ha@@ em@@ ic and ha@@ em@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to resistance .
5@@ 08 % increases the cost of C@@ max by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ is@@ ase can significantly increase its plasma concentrations and result with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection related side effects , including hyp@@ ot@@ ity , ten@@ dons , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
on basis of data to 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are expected to produce significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for man is unknown . A@@ generic solution to App@@ lic@@ ate may not be used due to possible toxic reactions of fet@@ us on the contained propylene gly@@ col not during pregnancy . ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk activ@@ ist rats , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is over@@ laid by men into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ist review , which was administered by em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us until the end of the down@@ time Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , showed during the down@@ time a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weights . &quot;
the in@@ vari@@ ability of A@@ generic has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events is not clari@@ fied whether they are applied in connection with the intake of A@@ generic or another at the same time to treat HIV treatment or whether they are a result of atro@@ cious disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ active patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ it@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses - like with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r bir@@ d@@ ants - the described mut@@ ations have rarely observed .
the early age of a ver@@ sion@@ ing 60 therapy is recommended to maintain the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can affect the following treatment .

&quot; the application of the treatment and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depends on the condition of the disease in the genital area , Al@@ dara is up to a maximum of 16 weeks of three times per week . • When small bas@@ al we@@ at@@ ants , it is during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between treatment cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
&quot; the cream is th@@ inner in front of the bed@@ side th@@ inner to wear on the affected skin areas , so that they have enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( the same cre@@ me , but without the substance ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
the main indi@@ gn@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients treated with complete deportation of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dara or the plac@@ ebo either daily or five times weekly .
the main indi@@ gn@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete deportation of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies to a total of 5@@ 05 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic cor@@ at@@ ants .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • With the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete absorption rate was composed of 66 % to 80 % with the patients treated with Al@@ dara treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of cream ( pain or it@@ ch ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hy@@ tom@@ atic ker@@ at@@ ants ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ om@@ ous adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons are the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options contra@@ indicated or less appropriate . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before joining and 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams is as long as continue until all the visible f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks each treatment period . &quot;
&quot; a break in the process described above should be weigh@@ ed if intensive local inflammation occur ( see Section 4.4 ) , or if a infection is observed . &quot;
&quot; if at the follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the lesi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient bore the cream as soon as he / she noticed it and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams is in a thin layer , and in the puri@@ fied , with f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in@@ infected skin area , until the cream is completely covered . &quot;
&quot; it should take place in these patients a degra@@ dation between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their autoimmune disease . &quot;
it should be done in these patients a degra@@ dation between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ @-@ out@@ pouring or GRA@@ FT @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ auth@@ oriz@@ ations were performed , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mos@@ is and a case with one to the circum@@ c@@ ision is observed . &quot;
&quot; with an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams in higher than the recommended doses , a higher risk of heavy local skin irrit@@ ations ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases were also observed under proper use severe local skin irrit@@ ation that have required a treatment and / or having a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions on the outcome of the ureth@@ ra came , some women had difficulties in the water , which made a emergency cath@@ eter and treatment of affected area . &quot;
&quot; to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cre@@ am immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous methods for the treatment of extreme f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital and Peri@@ an@@ al@@ region , there are no clinical experience before . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest at an increased rate of F@@ eig@@ war@@ zen@@ reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group in relation to the elimination of the f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local skin actions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or because of the sever@@ ity of local skin actions , a treatment of treatment can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be judged after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; currently , no data on long @-@ term cures rates are currently available for more than 36 months after treatment , should be considered for super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bas@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma and other suitable therapy forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended for previously treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that in case of large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of contact to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute cor@@ at@@ ants , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute cor@@ at@@ ants outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic cor@@ at@@ osis on the under@@ poor and hands will not support the effectiveness in this application of use , therefore such use will not be recommended . &quot;
local skin actions often occur but these reactions usually take on intensity or go back after completion of therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams .
&quot; when local skin actions are causing great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed to some days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - lesi@@ ons highlighted a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the imm@@ ac@@ ulate properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams should be applied with caution in patients , which receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies do not go direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embryo / f@@ öt@@ al development , the empt@@ ying or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ m@@ ess application , quanti@@ fi@@ able ser@@ um mirror ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) can be reached , no recommendation to apply during the down@@ time period . &quot;
the most commonly used and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creature in connection related side effects in studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions to the place of treatment of f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creature in the related side effects include complaints on the application site with a frequency of 28@@ ,@@ 1 % .
the patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream @-@ patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creature in this studies were a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects that were treated by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan evaluation of clinical signs , it shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with three @-@ day treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , Ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / exhaust . ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan evaluation of clinical signs , it shows that in these studies there were five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams very frequently to severe Er@@ y@@ themes ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and become severe ins@@ ulating and disgu@@ ise ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies for investig@@ ating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose Alo@@ pe@@ zie was determined by a frequency of 0.@@ 4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the accidental unique recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gi@@ as and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically he@@ avi@@ est side @-@ effect , which appeared after several or@@ als cans of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ o@@ graphic investigation were demonstrated according to the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od increasing system@@ ic concentrations of the alpha@@ bet and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine .
in 3 cases relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete trigger of the f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts were clearly superior to a plac@@ ebo treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment .
at 60 % of total 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients healed the f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts completely off ; this was with 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo therapies in the case ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; a complete division could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 treated with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind to plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hi@@ st@@ ological confirmed individual primary super@@ fi@@ ic bas@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all patients treated clin@@ ically cured and this also remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on three weekly use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discrete , non @-@ hy@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic AK@@ - lesi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 of treatment are@@ as@@ than on the un@@ eas@@ ant scal@@ p or on the face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show for patients with clin@@ ici@@ encies according to one or two treatment periods a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the legal indi@@ indications of extreme tor@@ war@@ ts , Ak@@ tin@@ ic Ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al Bas@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma are usually not based on pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dara Cre@@ am was examined in four random@@ ized , double @-@ blind studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with Moll@@ us@@ c@@ um Con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies where there were examined doses ( 3@@ x / week for a period of about 16 weeks b@@ z@@ w .
a minimal system@@ ic recording of the 5 % black I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three weekly use during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest remedies in Ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ s 0,@@ 1 , 0.@@ 2 and 1,6 n@@ g / ml at the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 2 bag ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bag ) . &quot;
&quot; the calculated half @-@ time period was about 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ h@@ our@@ less half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study , which indicates a extended ret@@ retention of the drug by means of the skin . &quot;
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has been low for top@@ o@@ ist skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent d@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ dic bas@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxicity in the rat @-@ doses resulted in doses from 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG to significantly imp@@ aired body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; one also yiel@@ ded no similar effects for four months .
a two @-@ year study of car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ity with mice in case of dental administration at three days a week induc@@ es no tum@@ ors on the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption from human skin and is not mut@@ ed , is a risk for man due to the system@@ ic exposure to be very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors performed in the group of mice , treated with the effective cream , earlier and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as regards the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission announced the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a licence for the transfer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal cells ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ er@@ stock of Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is designed for long @-@ time enzy@@ me treatment in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase lack ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders . &quot;
the initial in@@ fusion of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this to be increased every 15 minutes into a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ lation was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these patients should continue to be tigh@@ tened , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , in the repar@@ ation facilities for medical emergen@@ cies immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies form against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the course of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; given little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , must be cau@@ tious due to the theoretical risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after a break of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to be able to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion .
in case of light or moderate @-@ related reaction the treatment with Anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
&quot; in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be hal@@ ted until the symptoms are brought to decrease , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ pro@@ fen is considering considering . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be recorded with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine and acet@@ am@@ a@@ acet@@ one / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate which occurred in the pre @-@ defined reaction .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ esses because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ oc@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase consists .
&quot; experimental trials do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; because no data on new@@ bor@@ ns which were expon@@ entially over the breast milk , are advised to be recommended during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
side @-@ effects in clinical studies were measured mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which at 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients were observed in the study with participants below 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted medicine in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the Phase II study and their extension to a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are usually found in the following table ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , severe reactions appeared , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , respiratory and face @-@ face ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ er@@ Auth@@ orities in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly severe failure form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously all 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; for most patients , it came within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with the patients aged under the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) were available at 13 / 45 patients ( Ri@@ p ) As@@ ass@@ ent antibodies before , including 3 patients when never had come to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients with missing up to low anti@@ body level reported a robust decrease of the G@@ AG sp@@ ying in Har@@ n while in patients with high anti@@ body em@@ bodi@@ ments a variable decrease of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally until low neutral inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted drugs , even if the appearance of unwanted drug actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzy@@ me treatment is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulating sub@@ str@@ ates and preventing an additional accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzy@@ me .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly taken out of the cycle and of cells into the l@@ os@@ omes , most likely about cre@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the whole of the disease spectrum was awakened , the majority of patients from the middle of phen@@ otyp@@ e and only one patient pointed to the heavy phen@@ otyp@@ e . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an for@@ ci@@ zed explicit volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary outcomes for the effectiveness were the percentage change to the expected FE@@ V and the absolute secret in the 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ - salary .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where she received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , those treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients from the plac@@ ebo group an improvement of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and the salary to which in the following table is represented . &quot;
an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the estimated percentage of the FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period of time and the absolute lung @-@ volum@@ ina increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a hep@@ ac@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study , a normal liver size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a marked waste of the G@@ AG mirror was established in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) which remained constant to the end of the course .
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ genic patho@@ gen@@ ces between the patients , which coinci@@ ded by using a combined repository , the clin@@ ically significant changes for five drugs ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 20 % ) and a deterioration at 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been conducted a year @-@ year open phase 2 study , where mainly the safety and pharmac@@ o@@ graphic of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients , which were at the time of their acceptance into the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy displ@@ ac@@ ular form ) and 4 with the middle process form ) . &quot;
&quot; for four patients , the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - Spiegel in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; with several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) determined after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the heavy displ@@ ac@@ ular form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) , and all 4 patients with the middle di@@ sequ@@ ent shape were limited only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , research on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ dos@@ ages were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously all 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may be in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses are equal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate each new information , which will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ o@@ tic profile for patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less strongly affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on security @-@ har@@ mak@@ ology , toxicity in non @-@ profit making , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ism , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data can not recognize any particular dangers for the human being . &quot;

&quot; preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • J@@ e after body weight of individual patients first determine the number of dil@@ uted through@@ s . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) , if cancer is not removed ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ing &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) - cancer has already spread out to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ single &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the epith@@ eli@@ um cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is not treated in patients who previously have not been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously have already been applied other chemotherapy agents . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the hub of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in addition a &quot; anti @-@ e@@ tic &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid lack of prevention ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood flow changes or occur in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be infl@@ ated , or the dose decreases . &quot;
&quot; the active form of Pem@@ et@@ re@@ ed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents them to divide the cells . &quot;
&quot; the transformation of Pem@@ et@@ re@@ ed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells as in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta has been studied in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their illness .
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ single lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta have been treated in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta has also been compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , although both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study at 1 7@@ 25 patients who have previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 month compared to 9.@@ 3 months during the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; patients who had previously received a chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.4 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies patients , of which cancer does not attack the epith@@ eli@@ um cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival times than with the comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission was divided by El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a licence for the In@@ lim@@ ta of A@@ lim@@ ta to the entire European Union . &quot;
each through@@ put bottle has to be raised with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ chlori@@ de @-@ inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) - which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the through@@ put bottle and with 0.@@ 9 % non @-@ injection resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) on 100 ml is dil@@ uted ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin display for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ due di@@ ligence ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ due di@@ vul@@ ae epith@@ eli@@ al ha@@ st@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours after finishing the Pem@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin transactions , the day before and on the day of Pem@@ at@@ re@@ ed gift , as well as the day after the treatment is given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ id . &quot;
&quot; while the seven days before the first dose Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 cans fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy wall , as well as for another 21 days after the last Pem@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tra @-@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first Pem@@ at@@ re@@ ed dosage and after every third loading cycle .
&quot; in patients , the Pem@@ at@@ re@@ bel received , should be created prior to each gift a full blood image - including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ ytes . &quot;
the al@@ kal@@ phosph@@ ate ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to a 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage inspection must take place under Ber@@ brid@@ ging - the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the predictable therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Agricultural C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ ugly toxicity degree 3 ( except neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA has to be interrupted , until the patient has the value before the treatment &quot;
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA has to be abandoned if in patients after 2 dosage reduction toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity degree 3 or 4 appearance or so@@ - fort at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
clinical trials does not notice that in patients at the age of 65 Jah@@ z@@ ren or in comparison to patients aged under 65 years of age is increased by side @-@ effective risk .
&quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ conceivable and effectiveness . &quot;
clinical trials were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance from ≥ 45 ml / min without dosage adjustment necessary for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing building under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver functioning out of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ der@@ - bor@@ der@@ eness and / or transi@@ tioning values of &gt; The 3.@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver cancer ) are not specifically examined in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to the Kno@@ - chen@@ sou@@ ps and Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administered to patients before whose absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ atel@@ ine has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ - cy@@ ten@@ ess has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ aring number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction in degrees 3 / 4 ugly and non @-@ curing toxicity and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was desp@@ ised when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be dependent on Pem@@ et@@ re@@ ed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ l@@ actic measure to reduction treatment of unconditional toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ oxid@@ ants ( &gt; 1.@@ 3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and minim@@ ally - TE@@ NS 2 days after treatment with Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with Pem@@ at@@ re@@ xed is intended to avoid the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long semi@@ - value for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients when these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including el@@ ong@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid - accumulation in trans@@ cellular space should be a dra@@ in@@ age of the result before the Pem@@ et@@ re@@ ed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ os , and cerem@@ onial events were reported in clinical studies with Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ tive life @-@ substances ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ sted ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible impair@@ ment exists through Pem@@ et@@ re@@ ed , men should be pointed out before treatment - g@@ inn , advice regarding the locking system . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses can lead non @-@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,@@ 3 g daily ) to a reduced Pem@@ at@@ re@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of a increased intake of side effects . &quot;
therefore caution is advisable if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate can be applied in high doses .
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction - TE@@ NS 2 days after the therapy with Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed can be avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is related to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ des , the simultaneous application needs to be avoided at Pem@@ et@@ re@@ ed for at least 5 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pem@@ at@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
&quot; the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the t@@ inn@@ ate status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplastics , requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient ducks with or@@ als anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; there are no data for the use of Pem@@ et@@ re@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ ders , are expected to apply severe birth defects during an application during pregnancy . &quot;
Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be used during pregnancy except if absolutely - and after careful sealing of the user for the mother and risk to the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; because the possibility of a irre@@ ver@@ sible damage caused by Pem@@ et@@ re@@ ed , men should be pointed out before the treatment start to pick up consulting with regard to the sperm side . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed into the mother &apos;s milk , and unwanted effects in the arti@@ ll@@ ery inf@@ ant can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity unwanted effects which were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with m@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , and the random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin and Pem@@ at@@ re@@ ed Er@@ - kept and 163 patients with m@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , the random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin received as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was made in the population of all patients that were received in the treatment arm the test medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statis@@ tically significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and Dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ing plex@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown in the application of the Lun@@ ches / c@@ is@@ plat@@ inum arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole c@@ is@@ pl@@ a- T@@ in @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two therapies embrace itself through an improvement of the pul@@ mon@@ ary parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a poison@@ ing of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function over time in the chec@@ l@@ lar@@ m .

alli is inde@@ xed to the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ ical , fet@@ al diet . &quot;
alli must not be applied by children and young people under 18 because not sufficient data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; however , da Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal resor@@ bed , is in older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adaptation of the dosage is necessary . &quot;

the probability of occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase when alli is taken along with a fat @-@ rich retail@@ er or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; because weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved metabolic control , patients should consult a drug against diabetes before beginning a therapy with alli gains a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic can be adapted . &quot;
patients who take alli as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these medicines must be adapted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional oscill@@ ation measures , in order to prevent the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study with interactions of medicines and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in has been observed an ab@@ duction of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma facilities .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ als anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at could be influenced the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ enes were in the standard . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be recommended before bed@@ time a complem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamin E ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ ale development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side @-@ side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of un@@ recorded fat is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data not transfer@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of well @-@ known side effects , which were noted after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population in@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ si@@ ble that treatment with alli gains regarding possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
individual beads of 800 mg Or@@ list@@ at and multiple copies of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight pro@@ b@@ anden that significant clinical findings appeared .
&quot; in the majority of the cases reported by or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects such as at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at have been reported . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals , one can be attributed to the alleged properties of Or@@ list@@ at properties . &quot;
the therapeutic effect sets out in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper dune by the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ ic and Pan@@ cre@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , absorption of approximately 25 % of the food is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 showed the effectiveness of 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a cal@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ al diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as a proportion of those studies which have lost more than 5 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight of weight was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss came up in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.@@ 4 % ( output value 5.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.@@ 8 % ( output value 5.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chemotherapy , the moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be used by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug , which can be used as an anti@@ body ) . &quot;
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as to the effects in this age group is not enough information .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy and vom@@ iting for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
&quot; with chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients were treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ gling ron ( 126 from 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients were treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 von 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ gling ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
when compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission was shared by Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd. for approval by Alo@@ xi in the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indic@@ ative : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer prevention and preventing nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for preventing nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting that is induc@@ ed by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be reinforced by adding any of the chemotherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
&quot; da Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can leng@@ then the Dick@@ dar@@ ass@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nest@@ y shelter or signs of a subtle I@@ le@@ us after the injection . &quot;
&quot; however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 @-@ ant@@ ag@@ onists , however , is advisable to extend the Q@@ T interval or with drugs which prolon@@ gs the Q@@ T interval or in patients when the Q@@ T interval is extended or that tend to be such pro@@ long@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; apart from related to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi will neither be used in the days following chemotherapy nor for treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies hem@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron does not inhi@@ bited the activity of five studied chemotherapy ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ o@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ u@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in one on a population based pharmac@@ o@@ graphic analysis has been shown that the simultaneous casting of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ in@@ duction ( Ami@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ din , Ch@@ ini@@ um , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ ine , Ser@@ par@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences regarding the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies do not exist before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied without pregnant , unless it is deemed necessary by the doctor . &quot;
in clinical studies the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi related to head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ delicate actions and reactions to the arrangement ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) have been expressed in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
in the group with the highest doses were similar to und@@ es@@ irable events such as in other doses groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relations to be observed .
&quot; however , no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies were received in total 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with M. 50 mg / m2 , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given on Day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ni@@ ason . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 667 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ pl@@ ine , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received , which were given to Day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy included in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy induc@@ ed nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings of clin@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block those involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular De@@ c and Re@@ pol@@ arization involved i@@ onic channels and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers , was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ BC in single p@@ ants of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous risk follows an initial decrease in the plas@@ tic@@ on@@ ec@@ onds a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ al half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the whole dosage range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses , was between day 1 and day 5 measured medium ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mak@@ es@@ centr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ o@@ tic sim@@ ulations , the total @-@ annual hub of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days in total value ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached by 0.@@ 75 mg measured by 0.@@ 75 mg higher . however , the C@@ max was a higher resolution of 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % will be eliminated over the kidneys , and about another 50 % will be converted into two prim@@ aries , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on met@@ alli@@ zation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 is involved in the met@@ alli@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made about 40 % of the given dosage . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ tion in healthy , the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver function is increased in patients with severe liver disease , the tempor@@ al elimination and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is increased , however , a reduction of dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient about the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , which points to a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From prec@@ lin@@ clinical trials , notice that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of i@@ onic channels , which are involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular De@@ al@@ - and Re@@ pol@@ arization . &quot;
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose said in about the 30@@ x@@ of the therapeutic exposure to the people ) , which were given daily over two years led to a growing frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ abs , pancre@@ as , dr@@ apes ( rats ) , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and da Alo@@ xi will be determined by humans for the unique application , the relevance of these results is evaluated . &quot;

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative expert in which the predic@@ tion of approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C in the treatment of hep@@ atitis 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended . &quot;
&quot; this means that al@@ ph@@ eon a biological drugs called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , resem@@ ble an effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; Reference medicines &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long prolonged ) hep@@ atitis C ( one by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue causes damage to , in addition , the values of the liver &apos;s enzymes is increased from sp@@ in@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon placed data prior to the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , efficacy , safety and effectiveness in hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C , the effectiveness of al@@ ph@@ eon has been compared with the effectiveness of reference medicines by means of 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured , as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment on the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the drug and the market is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , which said on the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
after the treatment of the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon the disease has increased again in more patients than at the reference point of reference ; moreover Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
&quot; apart from that , the study was included in the study , to investigate the question , to what extent the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins , against the drug ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
it may be applied to the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust formation with immediate skin infection ) and small in@@ infected in@@ ants ( R@@ iss@@ - or snor@@ it@@ ple ) , down@@ cast and paraly@@ zed wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been verified or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ go against this kind of infections may not affect .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go may be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient speaks for two to three days not on the treatment , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
&quot; it acts by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells , in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was carried out in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was completed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients below Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke on treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected eyes , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ efal@@ onia showed similar response : if the results of both studies were inter@@ viewed with Hau@@ tw@@ ins , about 90 % of the patients of both groups on treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( eit@@ ed hollow ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA , are not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the contractor .
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) was the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go takes place at the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections against the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , in@@ infected small in@@ separ@@ ations , down@@ cast or paraly@@ zed wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission shared the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd shares a licence for the transfer of Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; patients , in which two to three days does not show improvement , are to be examined once and an alternative therapy will be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of sensi@@ tizing or serious local irrit@@ ation by using ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be , the treatment has been abandoned , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not supposed to be applied to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary infected wounds was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections that were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be taken into consideration when after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical methods on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the small plasma concentrations , which were reached by humans to topical application on de@@ ported skin or infected wounds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ing in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous casting of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol raised the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max for topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on de@@ ported skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure according to topical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not necessary to be required when topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive medicine after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the red@@ dish / post@@ nat@@ ale development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy when a top@@ i@@ anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
&quot; when deciding whether the Sti@@ ll continued / ending , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / ends , is between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , was the most frequently reported by @-@ effect irrit@@ ation at the arrangement that are approximately 1 % of the patient concerned . &quot;
&quot; reality Save Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ lei@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ta@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ta@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ors of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain bond point of the bacterial reef that distinguishes itself from the relationship of other ri@@ Bosnian anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the relationship of bos@@ om@@ al Protein L@@ 3 lies involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ vas@@ om@@ alen P @-@ binding location and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ z centre .
&quot; by connecting to this bond point , Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfers , partially P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ Bosnian under@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should be used on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some information forms , should help a consultation through experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in were . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an un@@ appealing to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes have to be considered with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults became 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adult and children ) , which received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ us treatment of secondary infected wounds , individual plastic positions were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place in days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and among the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording at humans according to topical application of 1 % of sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 de@@ ported skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP In@@ fr@@ aming . &quot;
met@@ amorph@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative met@@ alli@@ ism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human Leb@@ er@@ micro@@ som@@ en was primarily convey@@ ed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; studies for oral toxicity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

&quot; there was neither male nor female rats at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby one up to 5 times higher exposure was reached as the highest valued exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 de@@ ported skin : &quot;

&quot; the holder of approval for the transfer must make sure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ant system is available , as included in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application ( version 6.@@ 2 ) and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the holder of approval for the transfer is obliged to carry out more detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ant activities , as described in the version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with CH@@ MP . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that concern the liver ) with children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used within two doses from existing vaccines where a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is ensured that from two doses existing vaccine may be led to an end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hep@@ atitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vaccines function by bringing the immune system ( the natural immune defence of the body ) as it can apply against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and the available vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same disease , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered into existing vaccines in the frame of one of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults identical ingredients were included , some of the data that supports the use of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indi@@ gn@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of antibodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix is similar to a six @-@ month gap between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , appetite , pain on the inj@@ ecting , redness , mat@@ ory ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be hyper@@ sensitive to patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission shared the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als for a permit for the In@@ struction of Ambi@@ rix all over the world
&quot; the Stand@@ ardis@@ ing plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered by the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her is desired for hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the relevant mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines or with a combin@@ ant . &quot;
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) em@@ bodi@@ ment of anti @-@ hep@@ atitis ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - anti@@ body cells lie in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants vaccine .
&quot; it is not yet completely secured , whether immun@@ o @-@ competent persons who have raised on a hep@@ atitis ( hep@@ atitis ) , since they are also protected in no more veri@@ fi@@ able antibodies than through the immun@@ o@@ graphic memory . &quot;
3 As for all inj@@ ections should be available for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the detection of the vaccine corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and supervision always immediately available .
&quot; if a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardis@@ ing scheme is recommended with the comp@@ iling material , the 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; when hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system is achieved after the pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ation under circumstances , no sufficient anti @-@ h@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ body is achieved so that in these cases the gift of other vaccine may be necessary . &quot;
as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ ular administration in the glut@@ e@@ muscle can lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ fer@@ ment should be avoided these inj@@ ecting routes should be avoided .
&quot; however , in Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ ia or hem@@ or@@ atory disorders , however , it can be in@@ compar@@ atively sub@@ cut@@ aneous , since in these cases it can come to in@@ tram@@ us@@ ular gift to ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix had administered in the second life year in the form of a se@@ perate inj@@ ecting simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ onic , tet@@ rac@@ ul@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated Mas@@ j@@ ec@@ hil@@ us and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us S.@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ici@@ encies must be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response may be achieved .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this wording in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier thi@@ om@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ vatives . &quot;
clinical trials 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administered in a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 till the age of 15 .
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ doses compres@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and sailors on a set @-@ up basis per vaccine , but not on a base basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the Gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the promot@@ ers observed compared to 3@@ 9.4 % at the prob@@ es after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ cans compression .
&quot; after the complete vaccine reported , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the doctoral students , the Ambi@@ rix had administered , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the commis@@ sions , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age composite . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Mat@@ fulness was compared to each case ( i.e. over the entire vaccine ycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the promot@@ ers who got ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the prob@@ es which received the 3 @-@ doses compres@@ sing ) . &quot;
the incidence of em@@ bos@@ sed pain and sailors was small and comparable to that which has been observed after administration of the combin@@ ant with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the appearance of local actions and public actions was comparable to that in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combined with 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ated hep@@ atitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; however , after vaccination by ambi@@ rix had a common appearance of pain ( on the inj@@ ecting location ) per dose , not per Pro@@ band , reported . &quot;
the percentage of vaccines that schem@@ as with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis C were not different .
&quot; clinical studies conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years were the Ser@@ o@@ converted rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ converted rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study that was performed at 12@@ - up , including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ant with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 2@@ 89 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was exp@@ ir@@ able , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective mar@@ ries ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 after gift of the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age vaccine were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical trial study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after completion of the full vaccine ( i.e. in the month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ated hep@@ atitis B surface .
people who were at the time of pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ation between 12 and 15 years could be proven the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ h@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies to be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that compared to vaccination of 3 cans with a combin@@ ation@@ in hep@@ atitis - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ated hep@@ atitis B surface treatment in a dosage volume of 0,5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - up including 15 @-@ year old could be shown that the per@@ sever@@ ance of anti @-@ h@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies to be compared in the 0 @-@ 6 months @-@ vaccine is similar to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months .

&quot; the hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as bathing in the waters of water . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ iss@@ ful face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix not completely protect against infection with hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B virus even if the complete vaccination has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / her child are infected with hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus ( although you / her child cannot feel uncomfortable or sick / feel ) a vaccination may not prevent disorder .
&quot; a protection against other infections that are causing the liver or cause symptoms that are similar to those after a hep@@ atitis or hep@@ atitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• If you have been an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ ling skin lesi@@ ons ; breathing difficulties or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have occurred among you / your child an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • If you / her child have a heavy infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled appointment of the second vaccine ) .
&quot; in a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination by Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B / hep@@ atitis B vaccine with a reduced salary ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface ) .
the second vaccine of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine protection before termination of the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes ambi@@ rix is afflic@@ ted by individuals who suffer from severe ble@@ eding disorders , suffer from the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / her child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your body / its body @-@ body / or if you / her child can move to a her@@ edi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction is on vaccine .
&quot; 21 Sa@@ ver your doctor , if you are taking other medicines you / her child ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / her child have recently been vacc@@ inated , or if you have administered or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate locations and as many as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix had to be administered for the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women is not administered but it is urgently needed that they are vacc@@ inated for hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the transaction , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit of the utility is positive for Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix had only been launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited because of the low patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ y can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete end@@ ure or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the pre @-@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ y is divided - divided into several individual beads to meals - swal@@ lowed , under the food mixed , or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ ite ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach of leading s@@ ails ) or a nas@@ al ( through the nose in the stomach of leading mud ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ y was not compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a search@@ medication , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to appetite loss , a degra@@ ding inf@@ ancy in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , fluid , ar@@ ming , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , skin irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) ended to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ y was effectively prevented in patients with the disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle towards high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ ces .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ y was admitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine . &quot;
the use is indigenous to all patients with which a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel is already manifested in the newborn age ( within the first 28 life @-@ days ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ ac form ( in@@ complete end@@ ure , which manifes@@ ts itself after the first life of life ) then there is an indication for use when in An@@ am@@ n@@ esis exists a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephalopathy . &quot;

the daily dose is individually calculated according to the protein intolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² with children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
patients suffering from an early accidental lack of car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or ar@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ am@@ yl@@ ates is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase lack must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered patients with swal@@ lows as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets are not immediately going into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with so@@ dium and eco @-@ based clinical conditions only with caution .
&quot; since met@@ amorph@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate takes place over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; sub@@ cut@@ aneous goods from phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and a stolen loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses , and a dimin@@ ished number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot;
it could not be noticed whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is re@@ tired in men into the mother &apos;s milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding time is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at 56 % of patients stood at least an unwanted event ( AE ) on and at 78 % of these und@@ es@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old par@@ anor@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lack@@ eys , heavy hy@@ po@@ kal@@ a@@ emia , periph@@ er@@ al N@@ europ@@ ath@@ ie and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred at a 5 @-@ month old baby with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go out with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed with a intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limiting ne@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active connection associated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ated glut@@ amine that the kidneys will re@@ tired .
&quot; brus@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ate with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ omas ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ cycle can be assumed that for every gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 grams of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ate nitrogen nitrogen .
it is of meaning that diagnos@@ ing the diagnosis and treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical result .
the progn@@ osis of the early disease form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always infectious and the disease carried out even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking free an@@ alo@@ ga within the first life year of death .
&quot; by ha@@ st@@ aly@@ sis , the utilisation of alternative ways of nitrogen waste ( so@@ dium and so@@ dium @-@ acet@@ yl@@ ate ) , prot@@ ru@@ reduced c@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rates of new @-@ born at post @-@ part@@ al ( however , within the first life @-@ month ) , to increase diseases on 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients , whose disease were diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary fraud was the survival rate 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many too spiritual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a delay in the disease form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ame@@ scar@@ ce deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ish encephalopathy and then permanently treated with Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ested diet , the survival rates are 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurological defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ des to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ stru@@ ed in liver and kidneys , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ate is created . &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ amorph@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after gift of a single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis according to single distribution as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of oral cans of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ amorph@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous casting of nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form were found 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lical disorders or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in@@ opath@@ y , according to different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting is no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single p@@ ants ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ation in plastic bricks on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is exhausted within 24 hours of approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ate yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
&quot; after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had been treated with toxic substances ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ule is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , which can not swal@@ low no tablets , or patients with swal@@ lows ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ ley or a nos@@ edi@@ de . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
patients suffering from an early accidental lack of car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or ar@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ am@@ yl@@ ates is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ule contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; when rats were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ o from Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyram@@ idal cells of the brain . &quot;
&quot; a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old par@@ anor@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lack@@ eys , heavy hy@@ po@@ kal@@ a@@ emia , periph@@ er@@ al N@@ europ@@ ath@@ ie and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
ro@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ate with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ omas ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ated glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus value
&quot; on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ ment cycle , it can be assumed that for every gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 grams of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ onian nitrogen . &quot;
already existing neurological defic@@ its are also barely rever@@ sible and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur .
after a oral dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were found 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spo@@ ons 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spo@@ ons 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ ons 8,@@ 6 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to get the medication over a son@@ de , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzymes , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ p@@ ous waste products that accum@@ ulate themselves after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you have conducted laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you can influence AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during down@@ time , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug could move into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases were also turbul@@ ence , head@@ aches , head@@ aches , flavours , im@@ balances of o@@ bedience , remembran@@ ce , and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions . &quot;
&quot; if you determine one of these symptoms , you immediately get in touch with your doctor or the emergency of your hospital in order to start a corresponding treatment . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to the heart ) , for example , at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in breast @-@ grain with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ os ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ ING &quot; ( heart attack with electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox becomes applied to prevent blood@@ stream in patients , which can be administered up to one PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox at al@@ kal@@ ine / II@@ IA / II@@ IA / II@@ IA / II@@ IA / II@@ IA / II@@ IA / II@@ IA / II@@ IA / II@@ IA / II@@ IA / II@@ IA / II@@ IA / II@@ I , compared with the conventional com@@ bin@@ ational treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; during PCI , patients often became a tri@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a sh@@ utter ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood@@ stream like Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift from GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attack or Rev@@ ask@@ ed@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from one PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was in relation to all indicators just as effective as h@@ par@@ in , except for severe ble@@ eding , in which it was significantly more effective than h@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who might be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other shepherd , or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a blood of blood , as well as with heavy blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) ended the conclusion that angi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during one PCI is an acceptable replacement for sl@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 the European Commission announced the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd received approval for the In@@ det@@ ox of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST @-@ lever ) in case of emergency handle or when an early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended initiation dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if there is another PCI carried out in the patient , an additional bolt of 0,5 mg / kg should be increased and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
after the PCI requirements the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately before the procedure is administered by 0,5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of a initi@@ als of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a immediately following intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a single bolt @-@ hub of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened by 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be made . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the reproduced and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis will be rapidly administered . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; is the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis between 0.@@ 3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis will once again consider . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value 5 minutes after hub of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment , at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and even in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is an angi@@ ox @-@ inde@@ xed ( see below 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ question@@ able he@@ aters or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gland of low molecular sl@@ ats .
• well @-@ known over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other components or against c@@ ud@@ ine • active blood cells or increased blood risk . • harder un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ trac@@ eable bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment carefully in terms of symptoms and signs of a blood pressure especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI patients under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ud@@ ine in most blood vessels , can occur in patients suffering from a per@@ sever@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary interventions ( PCI ) during the treatment in principle all ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in patients , war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ud@@ .com , should be considered to monitor the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) , in order to ensure that the value after exp@@ ose of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine once again reached the level before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tika or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ants ) can be assumed that these substances may increase the blood value . &quot;
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ c@@ ines or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants the clinical and biological her@@ mo@@ st@@ as@@ e@@ parameters are regularly monitored in any case .
&quot; the experimental trials are insufficient regarding the effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the discharge or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see below 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine alone . 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ ment plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine group as well as in patients treated with sl@@ ats , it came more often in women and patients over 65 years of age , more frequently to und@@ es@@ irable events than with male or younger patients . &quot;
severe ble@@ eding have been defined according to AC@@ U@@ IT@@ Y and TI@@ MI standards for heavy ble@@ eding as in the foot@@ steps of table 2 .
both light and heavy blood vessels occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ud@@ in alone significantly less often than in the groups with pi@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ IT@@ Y heavy blood pressure was defined as one of the following events : in@@ extrac@@ ran@@ i@@ elle , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ oc@@ ular blood circulation or blood circulation , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glo@@ omy mirror of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with known blood@@ stream , re@@ operation due to a ble@@ eding , application of ble@@ eding products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;

the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine to 6000 patients who subjected to one PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ bard and in groups as well as in patients treated with sl@@ ats , it came more frequently in men and patients over 65 years more frequently to und@@ es@@ irable events than with male or younger patients . &quot;

&quot; following side effects , which are above listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are sorted according to system organic classes in table 6 . &quot;
in case of over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ud@@ ud@@ .com is immediately breaking off and the patient tigh@@ ter with a view to the signs of a ble@@ eding .
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a direct and specific t@@ rom@@ atic inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre as well as at the anim@@ ous region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ach is tied in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the bond of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine on the one hand turns the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thus generating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , juven@@ iles and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( among the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm in@@ ert or as a permanent in@@ fusion with a ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin in the control of glu@@ cose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or may not effectively process the ins@@ ulin .
&quot; ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from Human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter work@@ time has as a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in the application in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin may not be effective , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the modification of concentration of the substance gly@@ ca@@ dian hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.8 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % at human Norm@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against in@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine , or any of the other components , or in patients who have already suffer from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood glu@@ cose levels .
September 2004 the European Commission was shared by San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ atar Deutschland GmbH for approval by A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdom@@ en , the th@@ igh@@ s or the del@@ ity to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ en . &quot;
due to the reduced glu@@ ac@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ished in@@ sul@@ fi@@ able metabolism of the ins@@ ulin can be imp@@ aired in patients with a restriction of the liver function .
&quot; any change of the drug , the brand ( her@@ e- manufacturers ) , of the ins@@ ulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ izing etc ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of ins@@ ulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage , or the break@@ age of treatment , particularly in patients with a ins@@ ulin diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic rubber cord ; these states are potentially viable . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of a patient to another In@@ sul@@ int@@ ents , or an ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict physician supervision , and may make a change of dosage required . &quot;
the time of occurrence of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the real profile of the used In@@ sul@@ ine and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment regim@@ en .
&quot; among the substances that can increase the blood@@ sugar activity and reinforce the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic acid ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , fluid @-@ oxid@@ ants , sa@@ x@@ yl@@ ate , sa@@ x@@ yl@@ ates and Sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tika such as frau@@ dul@@ ans , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id in and reserve the symptoms of the ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter @-@ regulation will be weak@@ ened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive medicine did not show any differences between In@@ su@@ pre@@ ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether in@@ ins@@ ulin occurs in the human breast milk , but in general ins@@ ulin occurs neither into the breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use . &quot;
&quot; below are the origin@@ ating clinical studies known from clinical trials , grouped according to system organic classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on basis of availability ) . &quot;

Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy Wir@@ d failed to switch the inj@@ ecting place within the inj@@ ecting area and can occur in the result of a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy on the inj@@ ecting location .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic bodies with awareness can be treated by means of in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ cose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which are given by a doctor or by intraven@@ ous gift by glu@@ cose by a doctor .
&quot; after glu@@ cose j@@ ection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to as@@ certain the ur@@ gency for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin lowers the blood sugar level through the stimulation of the periph@@ er@@ al glu@@ cose levels ( in particular through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be carried out by In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency is shorter and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em Norm@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons at the age of 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , T@@ US showed in@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine in therapeutic effects of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg a dis@@ proportionate increase in the glu@@ cose effect , just like Hum@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as a normal human@@ ins@@ ulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cose effect for approximately 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; from the data it was clear that in an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ic control is achieved as with human Norm@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before Me@@ ge@@ ge@@ - ben , became a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ational control than with human Norm@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , becomes a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control like with human@@ ised ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for Gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the meal was given in comparison to human@@ ised ins@@ ulin , which was 30 minutes ( normal - 30 min . ) before beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) and in comparison with human@@ ised ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after the start of the meal in comparison to human , mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
