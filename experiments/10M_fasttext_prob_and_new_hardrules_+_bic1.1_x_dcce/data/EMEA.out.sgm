<seg id="7">The injecting solution is applied to the rapid control of gestures disruptions or behavioural disturbances if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"with both disorders, the solution can be used for inserting or the melting tablettes in patients who are preparing the swallowing of tablets difficulties."</seg>

<seg id="11">Aripiprazole seems to be mainly considered "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, whereby psychotic or manic symptoms will be reduced and their revising shall be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, the re-occur of symptoms, was investigated in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injecting solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which compared to a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>

<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injecting solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder affecting by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard skala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients, investigated on the treatment."</seg>

<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who were Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms unrest than the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when used for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify in four of the five spa studies are more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Abilify prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the replacements of Manic episodes in previously treated patients, and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, juveniles and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is subcutaneous (among the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm inert or as a permanent infusion with a insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the control of glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or may not effectively process the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisin differs very slightly from Humaninsulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter worktime has as a short-effective humaninsulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in the application in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type-2 diabetes, in which the body insulin may not be effective, Apidra has been studied in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the modification of concentration of the substance glycadian hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type-1 diabetes after six months a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.8% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% at Insulinlisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2 diabetes the lowering of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% at human Norminsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulinglulisine, or any of the other components, or in patients who have already suffer from a hypoglycaemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">September 2004 the European Commission was shared by Sanofi-Avatar Deutschland GmbH for approval by Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdomen, the thighs or the delity to apply or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdomen. "</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluaceogenesis capacity and the diminished insulfiable metabolism of the insulin can be impaired in patients with a restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the drug, the brand (here- manufacturers), of the insulin type (normal, NPH, galvanizing etc), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin demand."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage, or the breakage of treatment, particularly in patients with a insulin diabetes, may lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic rubber cord; these states are potentially viable."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"the conversion of a patient to another Insulintents, or an insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict physician supervision, and may make a change of dosage required."</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the real profile of the used Insuline and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"among the substances that can increase the bloodsugar activity and reinforce the inclination to hypoglycemic acid (ACE) -Hemmer, fluid-oxidants, saxylate, saxylates and Sulfonamid antibiotics."</seg>

<seg id="2991">"after glucose jection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to ascertain the urgency for the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers the blood sugar level through the stimulation of the peripheral glucose levels (in particular through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous ga- be carried out by Insulinglulisin the efficiency is shorter and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manem Norminsulin.</seg>
