&quot; the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for a cross @-@ cross ; despite their low size , they provide some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available . &quot;
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; quer@@ or ; to load , select settings extensions .... open the card card tools and select the required modules . &quot;
this is a list of standard settings modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that you may have more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package base which contains the cross @-@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click on the section section . then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to the crash , or the list of dro@@ pping , if available , delete . &quot;
the utility filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under the extras filter . with the module you can filter the current working directory on different types .
&quot; to view the DO@@ M series in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , choose extra DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently indicated web page . as a pres@@ et@@ ting the ad begins with the root no@@ des of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ ations , all other knots are sub@@ elements of this root canal . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E Type I@@ node / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various toolbar and text views so as to view the content of your local file system . &quot;
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in parallel with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ map graphically . each object is displayed by a rectangle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the treadmill display a rectangle , which represents a file or folder in your file system . the simplest navigation possess the right corner of reasonable color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rectangle , which is switched on colour mode , can be either a depth for the light detection of the sharpen@@ ed seal or the illustration of another file independent as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rectangle can be set with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can specify if enough space to display is present or if the area of subordin@@ ate right can occur ( whereby consequently , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle ) . &quot;
&quot; with display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should be respected that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . in the tre@@ ach@@ ment of the entries , this goal is not always respected , so that the subordin@@ ate entries will no longer be available . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square . &quot;
&quot; as division of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation remains to be left . here , it is for the stri@@ ves and to avoid space loss due to always beneficial the surfaces that are as square . the best methods on this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive igni@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal area for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a smoking pattern is drawn into the surface of the or@@ derly entry show , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets thought that was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
you can find the View picture gallery in the section called &quot; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under extras &quot; gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

a simple to @-@ use camera body will be provided to you with your digital camera and get your photos directly in &amp; checking . of course each medium and every ticket les@@ er is supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course each medium and every card reader who is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; checking .
&quot; it came ; contains a fast image processing with basic processing machine tools . you can use these to review and correct your photos , review , evaluate and correct . the processing abilities can be easily extended with KDE image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; checking came ; easy to use is , it makes d@@ utz@@ ating professional skills available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color foam and all available modules support the raw conver@@ gence by li@@ zed , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC @-@ Color . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , over which it can be looked . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs also &amp; checking came ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; once came ; attempts to do the milking of problems or suggestions , as easily as possible for them . wherever you use this links , your web browser opens a page in the error system . all required information is here already registered . follow the instructions to submit your report . &quot;
&quot; a project supported by a community is supported by a community . that means that the user and developers came to each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; checking , however , we would like to ask you questions to other users . however , in this mailing list , however , you should know this language so powerful . &quot;
you can also check the check @-@ out ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; checking .
&quot; the best start to participate at &amp; checking , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to register in the developer mailing list of &amp; checking . &quot;
&quot; when you came &amp; check ; for the first time , you will be asked where you can store your pictures and your database . you can simply specify a local , remote or removable folder . just enter the folder icon or click the folder icon icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the database is stored . this path remains the same for all the image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folder as you want to add . &amp; checking , you will be using the Al@@ ben@@ Library . settings according to your collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the pictures contains , as the basic folder . no picture is changed as an album . no picture will be modified . during the flow of the folder you will receive a progress report as this one : &quot;
&quot; arrived ; dur@@ acy re@@ taining the Bibli@@ gage ad throughout its entire depth . you can no sub@@ folder , unless it is i@@ ste in a hidden folder . this can be assured by taking a point before the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will have no photos as symbols . you can change the one by clicking any photo of the album and click on the folder icon . further details can be found in the albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up . you should learn your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use My albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so you can handle . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ kam@@ era@@ ung . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h decoder and Ro@@ h workflow .
a simple to @-@ use camera body will be provided to you with your digital camera and get your photos directly in &amp; checking . of course each medium and every ticket les@@ er is supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course each medium and every card reader who is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; checking .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera appears then as disk drive . the camera will also use the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras can be used in connection with the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 is used to communicate with digital cameras that supports a constantly growing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also supporting the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol based on the International Imaging Industry Association without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . because photos in general are large files and transmis@@ sions on the serial port is slowly the connection now gets obsol@@ ete . &amp; checking it ; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ mp@@ if support to read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ ti@@ am . EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not possible in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 or the creation might be very slow .
&quot; one of the most beautiful things arrived &amp; checking , is how easy to extend his functionality by modules : &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; checking ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it is also a user . your advantage is that it is much easier to supplement &amp; checking ; by writing a small module to complement a function , as the changes came in &amp; checking . &quot;
to simplify the window you can either move the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change the full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
&quot; you can drag and drop off images everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the universe , above the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture is not contained in keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection can be made available to you : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that is displayed in the toolbar . so , the filtering is displayed on the fil@@ ename only when this ind is displayed . which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog box . &quot;

&quot; it came ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . it allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two pic@@ sig@@ natures the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture . by means of a s@@ ell@@ al@@ erts , the results can be enlarged or reduced . if you drop a picture of anywhere via the symbol of the un@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open up and you can drop it there . &quot;
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and a check ; finds the appropriate pictures . also here can be set a Swan .
this rider provides an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini @-@ Program . you can drag and move it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse kno@@ b to drag a square . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this of course requires that your images ge@@ o @-@ data included .
&quot; in the array below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it is then added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ graphy . &quot;
&quot; arrived ; puts a lumin@@ ous in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em light Add to the context menu . the selection will be added to the light menu and open the window . if you are back in the context menu ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ osity quickly with L extras . &quot;
&quot; from the pre @-@ look bar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place it there . a small arrow displays you to which copy in which window area is to be seen . so if you can preview synchron@@ ize your copy from the toolbar , then you will be compared with the other picture . so you can compare the same area of both pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to track quickly from a picture series . if you use pairs of images out of the toolbar , then the left mouse button is automatically displayed in the left side . this will be displayed in the right panel . this will simplify it through a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal additions are also working directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
&quot; all imaging information from the right side@@ bar of the main window , are available for both thumb@@ nails in the lumin@@ aire . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swing function that you have to detect on the crossed paths . to preview the visible section of the picture , you have to click the click and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed . in the mode Pre@@ view , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zoom works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ regul@@ ator under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in the image and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are viewing in the mode preview .
what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion management ? digital stock management considers every part of the process of follows after the image has been made up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photographs will take up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photographs will take up a form of digital instruction . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , we will be able to use , edit , edit , group@@ ing , archiving , maintain , wait and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale stock management takes on , inde@@ xed , ass@@ ures , seek , transformed , ready @-@ assembled and exporting content to the one mon@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata are defined as data about data . metadata are available in accordance with your definition data that provide information on or documentation of other data that are managed by application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not even know how many photos you have . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you do not want to save very fast search and a secure archiving to you with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you want to store any of your system in contrast to the data structure . you have to decide whether other access to your photos should be stored , whether you have to switch it to a reserved drive or on a network station &amp; etc . make sure you have to move on a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location . if you are using enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , const@@ ants from pictures to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then be able to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes st@@ acks processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the option metadata to be stored in the setup page of the metadata in &amp; checking . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this then you can subsequently choose the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu .
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? this includes a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now select any photo keywords , labelling and evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; let us now proceed with keywords , keywords , as you continue with other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import kat@@ alog images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; check came ; automatically insert the tree for you to insert the pictures into the right place . the changed keywords are carried out by &amp; checking ; updated while the under@@ trees are tr@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; the graphics shows how different metadata about it . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates are properties of all pictures . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ise your metadata . &quot;
&quot; if you want most to just see your photos simply , they want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in making your photos . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical time of time is present again , you might even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panoramic position . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos is the title more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to help the viewer to help Him to understand what you need to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for himself alone .
&quot; with &amp; checking came ; you can save any number of text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) . if you can even export it to a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE can even tell you a sp@@ elling test . so you will have to tell you the story for the opening bt@@ edness no second time . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another town without a navigation system ? it was not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already comes with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities to take advantage of ge@@ olo@@ c@@ alization are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will be able to open in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export the photos on the reception . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also apply to all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description says you which information in the furniture page of &amp; checking came ; when information is stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , e.g. to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to change the name of a company or organization . this field does not support Com@@ mas nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; text title ( syn@@ onym for fi@@ ber@@ line ) : linked to the author . examples for this can be titles as : An@@ te photographer , freelance photographer or Independent photographer photographer . as this is a note about the author &apos;s author , this must also be filled out . &quot;
publishers ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer is listed here for a message agency like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency offers the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not provide protection against abuse . each of which has a little bit more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator , to delete or modify this problem . the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important to this . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image unique . &amp; n@@ bsp ; will provide such a module for st@@ ack@@ able processing in the near future .
&quot; themes : disk errors , disk , black@@ ness , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which you can also happen at traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are dealing with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; roll On@@ track , the biggest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these pre @-@ sigh@@ ted must be treated and you may not last longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives quality . of course there are offers about Gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 the piece which is a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your sur@@ veying room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good disco@@ s and good mounting devices and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . so it &apos;s about the right select . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you just have just written it . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect yourself . despite this massive protection they require by chemical aging , ul@@ tra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently brings wonders to CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are similar applications that damaged data from cor@@ rupted flo@@ ppy disks , hard disks , bottle media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray dis@@ ks seem to win the For@@ mat@@ War against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost h@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; they are slowly burning with a good reception on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . also read the media using a description , date &amp; author features and then on a clean , dark dry and especially on animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software . &quot;
&quot; flo@@ ppy disk manufacturer retain your statistics for themselves . your production erg@@ s include a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disk drives on this subject : dis@@ sol@@ ation study &quot;
&quot; shortly , Dis@@ ks keep on the longest if you are powered at the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower Temper@@ ature , this error can not notice the most immediate failure . some of S@@ MAR@@ T can notice this error . some of S@@ MAR@@ T will notice the expected life time period between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only a complete loss due to over@@ tension . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electric current before you have secured the files , but these losses normally leave itself without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices does not make much difference , that can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high speed processors . thus , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious loss , hardware @-@ age , non @-@ destructive mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore , protect themselves before an avoidable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against black@@ heads is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy @-@ heat and is available the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , remember that there is not any plug @-@ in bar also includes an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it protects against flash and thus protects the properly connected devices .
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should also be aware that also all the periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers offer over@@ voltage scor@@ er also through this one over@@ voltage . others provide connection options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of the cable mo@@ dems and the TV map . &quot;
&quot; if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also includes protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for traveling . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines will not really help you . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a sub@@ fragile power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection from over@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide the battery power when an electric power comes . this gives you the possibility of saving your data and running the system . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the life time of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
concern yourself exposed to the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare his security in rap@@ ids with the cost of avoiding these . a cost @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection is available for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you think about how well your computer is protected . at the end you should always remember all cable before you drive to the holidays .
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data . &quot;
&quot; they are very expensive compared to the HDDs , however , very expensive - 40 GB cost and dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost @-@ Dollars / dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . your free memory is available at 1 GB and you will not get rid of your images in full resolution online . the professional version provides you with unlimited memory that should only be verified in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically controlled thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies is included in the offer a backup and a con@@ ferred memory . thus , they are des@@ perate . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transmis@@ sions are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs represent at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that you have occurred when a transfer error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable networks are another source of transmission losses , since they create interference within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of bugs per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle records at low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . with not@@ ebooks the percentage of th@@ iev@@ es is already 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux , has long been no longer sigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : incorrect , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process is avoided during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file has not been completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false @-@ theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and smoke @-@ characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ Sens@@ ors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deterior@@ ated . even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore , make no one responsible for data loss . therefore , make sure your data is frequently affected by a loss and test this backup before you make some dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the scale change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make daily your backup on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning storm , you are lucky when the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests local and destroyed a lot . forget airplane l@@ gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . you usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , deser@@ ving always means a local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , to the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as indicated above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple stages again . this backup comes back to such a backup system next with the exception that it is only secluded and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmis@@ sions tran@@ r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security about ss@@ h .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer to a DVD or other op@@ tic medium .
this approach allows you to restore losses and restore it . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; metadata : metadata , in image file stored IP@@ TC information , Associate X@@ MP files , original , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and metadata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies to be observed : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , all of what is said today is going to be careful with caution . unfortunately , there is no other option as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is back@@ wards compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the more easy it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by means of explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available today for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s take the time you plan your scal@@ ability and have the area you enlarge want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . with * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record has been detected by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 , size the record in M@@ B@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,@@ 3 , fat@@ 16 , 32 and reis@@ er@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of reis@@ er@@ fs if needed &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be simpler from year to year . &quot;
GI@@ F is a proprietary format that disappears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it any more .
&quot; P@@ NG is designed as an open source standard designed to replace the GI@@ F . however , it is los@@ able , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . P@@ NG may require relative many administrative information , but not as many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF , we would like to recommend you to store your pictures . &quot;
&quot; TI@@ FF has been widely used as image format . TI@@ FF may be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss of free compres@@ sive salt ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , a problem is that this format of many people has been adapted . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open raw format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was already developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and we hope to use the TI@@ FF / EP format and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer it before an original your shot , mostly in the raw format , to archi@@ ved as it saves the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider when you use DN@@ G as a container . therefore , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put it all there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organisation that supports a wide range of applications for business purposes and business models . for the activities of D@@ C@@ MI , the work in the D@@ C@@ MI @-@ communities and the D@@ C@@ MI @-@ Working Groups , annual conferences and workshops , standardis@@ ed connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures on the cam@@ am@@ edi@@ um are , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fin@@ er editing process you can use external programs . if you use the pictures again with &amp; check ; then edit the metadata again . these were cut down from the other programs under certain conditions .
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in Web@@ galleries , co@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact leaves , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; checking . in the section add a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can already add photos to your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to Import images to your alarm database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect them to the computer , turn the camera onto the display mode and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , this is trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , the file name is displayed , the fil@@ ename and a symbol of the file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera is displayed . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that will be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . please note that some digital cameras will not be available .
&quot; the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , producer , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as in the metadata bar , and the image processing . note that this metadata are not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then the selection of All download . this loads the photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; checking . . downloading the photos will be downloaded safely to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only choose the desired accessory methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download selected . the button selected is as long as you have selected some pictures . &quot;
if your camera supports this is an option New download is available . these pictures have not been downloaded yet . in this case the new pictures with a star are marked in advance . if you choose this option only the new pictures are downloaded .
&quot; when you use the buttons , download or download selected , a dialog with which you can select the target album , in which the photos are sorted , displayed in the section My records . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after that you have chosen the target album , press OK , and &amp; check ; invites the pictures from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them by del@@ eting the button Del@@ ete . if you just want to delete some , then you must first select it and delete deleted . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no possibility to restore your camera deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos completely deleted from the camera ; if you want to delete it from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ ename are normally deleted once the photos from the camera were deleted . this can be useful to double fil@@ ename in the same album . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the picture was made to integrate into the fil@@ ename .
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for dat@@ ory sub @-@ based maintenance . if you use this latter option , a folder is created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens up three further options that are performed before the pictures are stored on the disk . the first two affect the data about the author in section Standard Aut@@ or@@ denti@@ ty . with the last option , you can correct the relevant entries from the EX@@ IF data in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
if you want another date format than the standard format you can use e.g. in the editing field the pre@@ fix photographer - % m@@ - % d % H : % S . turn the option date &amp; time to read . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command .
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in small letters . or in large letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; checking came ; for a photo used , below the name is displayed , the camera is available in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera ster next time . &quot;
&quot; once came ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to the timing of the recording . not all cameras make this information available . in section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic spin is normally switched off , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is displayed in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic spin and select the automatic spin in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera is made information about the date , where the photo was made available , &amp; n@@ ut@@ ch . all pictures with the same date will be loaded onto the picture data . all pictures with the same date are loaded onto the same album . all pictures with the same date will be available for download , which information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case saves you ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option , use this option automatically and select the option of data @-@ based under@@ mines at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button download . then select up@@ loading . the file sel@@ ector dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears , where you can select the files that can be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; checking , you where the pictures will be up@@ loaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . it is a position that is indicated in length and lati@@ tude , which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to create an area by automatic recording of GPS data to carto@@ graphic . environmental pl@@ anner , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can use a browser to show the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; check ; users want to send the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to include the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first you should know that exi@@ bition is a lot of GPS data fields , such as the direction , saddle and ticket reference . the question is actually more how the data entered into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post@@ processing of GPS data and image files to the manual input of known locations . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recipients . either as a ticket module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;

downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you have to store this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; when you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tude , or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the pre @-@ colored coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google@@ .com does not show European road types . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , all navigation details for Europe show . &quot;
&quot; checking out ; attempts to give you so much control over your work processes as possible . to access these settings , you need to set up on these settings ; set up . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; select action can be set on embedded preview or editing image editing . they attach the standard behaviour of &amp; checking , fixed when you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . also with a database synchron@@ isation , these data is written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for fi@@ ber@@ line : this field should contain the professional photographer of the photographer . this can be examples of a professional photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editors is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to enter the photo . this does not need to be the author , then these organizations should be registered here , then the image or agency should be registered here , then the group or agency should be enum@@ er@@ ated here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this metadata is always available in the picture and not only came in the database . these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; checking ; they will be imported without lost .
&quot; cap@@ tions stored as an embedded bran@@ ding ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG images : this syn@@ cing the comments that you have to be read on your photos , with the images included in the pictures , they may also be written by other pic@@ ks . these can be over@@ written by those of them ; over@@ written . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear , when the mouse cursor in the main window over a file rests . depending on the option this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; # 160 ; checking , supports a number of different image formats and some video formats . to set out which file types &amp; checking came ; display , you can add the file expan@@ sions of this list and remove ; Alb@@ um@@ Fol@@ ders that has no of these extensions , from &amp; checking . &quot;
the default settings can be reset you again by pressing the button &apos; button to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the beac@@ on of &amp; checking came ; can be switched on this page to the default values . however , if you use the lumin@@ ous mode . some pictures have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can obtain even better reference results . &quot;
&quot; by default the image editing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose it here . you can switch the toolbar in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image editing , this memor@@ ative can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and off . &quot;
Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of light density than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about this declaration .
&quot; using P@@ NG compres@@ sing , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation is not reduced the image quality because P@@ NG is needed more time for training and un@@ packing . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
with the option TI@@ FF files compressed you can turn the de@@ fl@@ ate com@@ bustion engine for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality because the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is working out .
&quot; with setting low @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files , you can save a loss of loss . even if you have been written los@@ sy , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JP@@ EG . as this paragraph , metadata were not supported , but was still in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; checking , the image editing is only a picture of pictures for photos . currently , it is very fast developing a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the default is that all green pixels are equal to the same . if you use this option with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates this issue with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 pal@@ let pattern with the V@@ NG@@ C or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the whit@@ eboard is used immediately . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only if the whit@@ ening is not set equal . standard is it a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details can be found in the nick@@ el . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is the Spit@@ z , so the parts of your pictures have the burned @-@ in , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the Spit@@ z . lastly , you can try to re@@ construct the he@@ aps in various ros@@ at@@ ables . lastly , you can try some parts of the missing information out of the Spit@@ z . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast s@@ ati@@ ful like green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing - and red @-@ shares from the still uns@@ saturated blue pixel . of course this is a question how much colour or white you want .
&quot; when you select the option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; put the magni@@ fying value after your taste . you probably need to put it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; joints . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should consider conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to get an entire image from the sub @-@ fil@@ tered data that provides a lot of cameras and that is known as a CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ wing .
&amp; D@@ cra@@ w arrived ; and D@@ cra@@ w makes you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . but it produces Far@@ bar@@ te@@ fak@@ te in the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color sof@@ tening of your lens , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color @-@ correction , since you are performed during the raw conver@@ gence . &quot;
a profile translated the color information and gives instructions how these things should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; che@@ er ; information such as colour information from a color room in the other are thus the colors as accurately as possible .
conduct questions if a picture is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; color profile folder , click here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; checking , this folder then examined during the Star@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; settings of ICC profiles , you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed at opening the blank file later . &quot;
the color scheme is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are colored not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera channels and model that you use . not all profiles are created on the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain dy@@ e gam@@ ma , not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the dy@@ e mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile with which you can em@@ ulate how your image can be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your camera and some colours can therefore be very saturated . this could correct you manually , rather than rely on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is pretty obvious which color profile is intended for them for what is intended . unfortunately , not at the models of Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles match together . this answer is naturally in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile expands the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutrality , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ d ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; images and image processing ; many modules support , which have been written to cooperate with each program , which supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use , and these modules will be loaded from &amp; checking ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks , which are carried out by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings can be set . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about the K@@ IP@@ I module can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slides should be easy to understand . the upper Re@@ gler j@@ us@@ ks the time between image operations , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other An@@ cross@@ ings turn off the metadata and which at the lower end of the images are stored during the display . &quot;
&quot; camera properties show on the left a list of all supported cameras . on the right hand , a button automatic detection , which is trying to identify a camera that is attached to the computer . currently , you are using the camera settings . currently , you are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end you can put the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras from the camera . you need to specify the path , / m@@ apped / camera or / m@@ nt / or , specify on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , you need to connect the camera to your computer , insert them in the ad mode and switch off . &quot;
&quot; try out whether &amp; checking came ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set cam@@ amo@@ del and Port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
with the option Con@@ tri@@ g@@ dialog for the moving of &gt; images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer show you can adjust the rec@@ ision of a photo in an album . in the sections of a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be silent through &amp; checking ; apply if you use the option to apply changes to the right side@@ bar without any questions . otherwise you have to apply the changes to the button changes .
you can also include the display of the welcome screen from &amp; checking ; in the start@@ up . this will speed up the starting process of &amp; checking .
&quot; the adjustment Bei@@ m start looking for new photos is forcing &amp; checking , the basic folder was deleted for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start @-@ time from &amp; checking . . if something from the basic folder was deleted , asks &amp; checking , you whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; checking ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings allow you to choose among settings design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; checking , you will find more information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # came ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view and improve your photos and improve your image editing . the image editing can be started by clicking on a picture , or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry . &quot;
the editing editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; checking . so you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I module can be found in the editing editing section .
&quot; status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current fil@@ ename , magni@@ fier factor and the current image size indicates . &quot;
a menu bar on the top edge and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly used functions .
&quot; the processing functions of image editing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file or save the button save from the toolbar , once you have saved the original photo . &quot;
so you should customize a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save your file .
&quot; as long as you do not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery or the button Again Re@@ manufacture editing re@@ producing in the toolbar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last saving . &quot;
virtually any action of editing editing can be und@@ own or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting any reco@@ vering or recovered by selecting reco@@ vering from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make yourself the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to turn back and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; about the reverse or restore button in the toolbar one moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are also revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using navigation buttons in the toolbar panel , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu file , you will ask if you want to save it . &quot;
&quot; you can get in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the toolbar menu . &quot;
&quot; to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : enlarge factor automatically &quot;
&quot; full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view , in which you use the Es@@ c button . usually , you can change it in the settings dialog of &amp; checking . change this you can call it in the settings dialog box ; you can view it in the settings dialog . you can view the section to set up the image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can select the image file in the menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; prin@@ table dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sentences . whole picture @-@ pages can choose from your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select expor@@ ters from the menu album expor@@ ters . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same page bar is available , even in the editing editing . it is displayed when one of the five hor@@ semen is clicked on : &quot;
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side bar appear or again disappear into the edge .
&quot; in the label view , you can enter cap@@ tions with unlimited size or insert . note the remark below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . that means all special characters are allowed to be copied into the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and speci@@ fies special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC cap@@ tion field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented it , you either use the button , or simply change to the next image , the marking are then saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the use button , there is one button More . with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also check the metadata in the files . however , this will always be performed if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation section shows a review of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting facilities . it can be used either with a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar , or with the keyboard short@@ cut + 0 ... 5 , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field . enco@@ ding follows the diagram in the following table :
&quot; the keywords view shows a search box to the filtering of the keywords , the keywords and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes ; -@@ session crossed . &quot;
the keywords will be dynamically adapted to the key@@ word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are saved for quick access . &quot;
tags can also be set by mark@@ ers of the corresponding attach@@ ments in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; when multiple images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the keywords tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the whole selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the keywords filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling filter is used to change the selection of the images indicated in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keywords and view@@ points are used on the right side , only the cutting quantity of these two will be displayed . all created tags are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop them . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . then a dialog you ask if you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example shows the main window depic@@ ting the pictures in a calendar tag . the keywords filters are reduced to three pictures . they were drawn with Str@@ g + a , and after that a key@@ word is drawn from the right hand tree on the selection and set there . a dialogue asks if this key@@ word is to be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched on under Settings .
&quot; if you have a rule and created and find that it would be a or its , you can easily change it with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , after which is looked for in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
for example you can set up a Advanced Search of all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to cross the cross field at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this : &quot;
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I did it mainly to &amp; checking ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason why you use a color@@ fully managed workflow , the colours that have photographed by your camera or scanner . with a color@@ fully managed workflow you can reach that colors available on your monitor of your camera or scanner and that the colours you print or on the web you will publish them out of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme comes on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to provide for the results which he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate information about color management . in addition , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with detailed information to make your own informative decisions to make you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image complies with all the above criteria , then you must not take care of colour management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor of the s@@ R@@ GB color box . ( more information can be found below )
your only other image files are sent by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is standard .
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color tree and get to think about color@@ fully ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB in comparison to the colors that we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ hoe region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB color foam , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger colour finishes so check Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on info and then to information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the R@@ GB color room ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB color or not , you need to work your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ tish , since s@@ R@@ GB of it , therefore , you must either use your monitor on s@@ R@@ GB standard , then you must either use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve one image in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual treatment . &quot;
the functions norm@@ alize the same , automatic , automatic and contrast extend from the menu basket automatic correction automatically try out of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which best suits your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the ligh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its color sh@@ aded . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
&quot; the same : this method j@@ us@@ ks the ligh@@ tening of the selected picture , so that the h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram of intention is to be as flat as possible . it &apos;s the same very good results in improving the contra@@ sting of an image , sometimes it also produces a very powerful operation that causes either wonders in a picture or it destro@@ ys . &quot;
automatic ab@@ identical : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . it determines the dark and light threshold and j@@ us@@ ts the red , green and blue @-@ channels on the whole H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram . &quot;
contrast aug@@ mentation : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the highest possible area and a new ji@@ usti@@ ble of all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white @-@ straight away from &amp; checking came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the whi@@ pping of a photos .
&quot; the white @-@ straight correction is slightly limited because of a color foam with 8 @-@ bit per colour . so , if you can perform the whit@@ ening mode in the raw mode , which is working in the 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways to correc@@ ting the correction is better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white fe@@ at of the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym is protected . it will start using the menu items of the white color .
&quot; the for@@ en@@ ster can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target zone can be adjusted . if you want to see the original white color right again , then click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target pictures has a red marker . the loop of the Pix@@ els below this marker is shown as vertical line in H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram .
&quot; on the right top is a h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram displayed , that dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ators . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adju@@ sting you can improve the shadow details of your photos or even down . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere to use the image temperature of the white water . this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white color with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator indi@@ an increases the colors if more than a colour channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. You will display the combined result in the whit@@ eboard . this is displayed in the preview as a recur@@ iner indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons to save as and store exactly this . each setting of the whit@@ eli@@ hood you have set you can save to a text file and then load later again .
the button pres@@ ets takes all filter values back to their standard values and the associated neutral White &apos;s . note that also neutral settings will be shown to another photo as your original . if you save this your original image is changed .
&quot; you can adjust the enco@@ ders per colour channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widespread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . this enco@@ ding is also required for high @-@ quality images . this enco@@ ding is also required for high @-@ quality images . this enco@@ ding is also available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapters of color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under colours of sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to keep multiple colors at the same time . this is helpful when your camera or your scanner always make the same error and you can always find the same correction . in the manual for audio correc@@ tions you can find more information .
&quot; a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for the gradient , that you will find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; tool color effects provides you four color effects , a solar @-@ effect effect , a bicycle @-@ filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ onal filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar steri@@ lization was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of the image sh@@ aded by the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas sheltered from the additional light . this tool was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to make this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controlled the solar steri@@ lization . at about 50 % intensity shows the image what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase finally generates a negative image , that is not to produce on photo paper . &quot;
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that makes it a stronger contrast @-@ effect that makes the colors brilliant and glow . try it simple but he em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on daylight and converted colour film of the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus making a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated fatty acids , but also some photographs , especially those of which are hardly landscapes . &quot;
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on to the contrast can@@ als . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting repeat the strength of the ne@@ on . with great images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color tr@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can view the various color gra@@ ins of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . as soon as you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will reduce you . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ven / contrast / Gamma , the tool is a key correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you need for the application in the area of sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of Inten@@ sity values , a H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graphs are three s@@ late into the wrapped and which can be moved to change the intensi@@ fication of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ators and take care of how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and the preview of the picture can be seen . the preview is dynamic , using the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is frequently represented by a linear or log@@ arith@@ me@@ tic axis . for pictures of a digital camera the linear h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ me@@ gram of a single column is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ me@@ tical order is useful .
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for light tones and the lowest for middle sounds , often Gam@@ ma@@ ize . &quot;
&quot; the three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically detect the input rated by the shadow , middle and light tones . in addition , there is one button for an fully automatic alignment . &quot;
&quot; output : the output tests allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to evaluate the output file , e.g. used to create a refined picture as background , while something else is seen in the foreground . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the output levels of the picture .
save as and store : with these buttons the detected values in the file system can be saved and later loaded . the Gimp is used format .
&quot; when you use this mode and the three color p@@ all@@ ets , the input fields will automatically use for all shadows , means and Sundays . select the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image of the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram for Rot@@ - , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ators . &quot;
the option of over@@ exposure indic@@ ator controls all color channels to see over@@ exposed pixel and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect in the final outcome .
&quot; below you see an example of the alignment of the intervention applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output options are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original is displayed and the target image is displayed dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modify channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed by the module :
&quot; beside this cas@@ ket there are two symbols to move between a linear and an log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures with a digital camera , the linear mode is generated by linear mode of linear mode . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; if you want to move for example a c@@ vent@@ eil to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds with dark@@ er output files and that the associated image pixels dark@@ er . &quot;
the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change is a suitable line on the curve displayed the original . create a point on this line and move it off until the value after your taste is j@@ us@@ hed .
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve which you created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp spa format .
&quot; if you want to create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ all@@ ets , you automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun tones . select the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and abra@@ sion curve . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ exposure indic@@ ator controls all color channels , to be over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result list . here , it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect in the final outcome . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ee channel . shadow and Sundays was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ ers of the &amp; checking came ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ ers is another developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ ers of the editing .
using the channel optional box you can select the color for the hi@@ sto@@ gram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left side of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target picture features a red marker . if you position this in the image a vertical line in the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram to show you the appropriate colour .
&quot; the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ators for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you are also able to keep the screen TV@@ och@@ rom , as the channel mix@@ ers then activate the appropriate black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of one color comes to a visible smoking , which is not at the same point in the colour channel , and whose smoke pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ re conversion so you will reduce the color first . &quot;
the saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you for later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp channel sound format .
the option of over@@ exposure indic@@ ator controls all color channels to see over@@ exposed pixel and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect in the final outcome .
below you can see a photo shown in the blue channel new . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited picture under ( 2 ) can be seen .
&quot; black / White @-@ photography was always intrigu@@ ing because of your abstraction . with the development of digital photography , black / White is a working step , as colour images can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super Satellite &quot;
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scen@@ eries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
&quot; or@@ fil@@ tered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lime filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and a@@ erial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) or@@ fil@@ tered . &quot;
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lime filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ ades to day @-@ time . therefore similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : it creates warm bright and medium tones for it . this is very similar to the process of taking a pressure and the re@@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; checking came ; tool texture can apply you can apply decorative textures to an image .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a colour image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop type of portrait of enlarged points or as a wall image on a wall . the menu item image texture can be used for it . &quot;
relief : shift the parameter to the right increases the sem@@ b@@ lance of the depth and tri@@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper Tex@@ ture@@ ff@@ ect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) see parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; checking came ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image .
keeping the eye of a view into the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep its attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ ak eye . under the picture you can add the module from the image editing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired butter type for your image . through the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce det , it cuts with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ effect and decor@@ ates adds a decorative frame with designs . &quot;
width : width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool using aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture in any place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text box , orientation , color from the color tree and the character set with its characteristics as you need . the larger the character set must be . to conclude , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ sigh@@ ted background . &quot;
&quot; every setting that you have chosen for your text may change , until you press on the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the picture is saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; checking came ; tool Sch@@ abl@@ one can apply a template using one image .
the menu image template can be used in image processing can be used to create sten@@ cil over one image .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions about the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and you should simply add an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; check ; Mail@@ ing list came and came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog box . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the template has been set for the template , the folder structure of the template is reflected . the selection of a folder is updated automatically . &quot;
below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button magni@@ fies the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; reduction : this button res@@ ized the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move below the image below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
&quot; use OK , if you want to apply the template to your picture . the image will then be automatically adapted to the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&amp; check came ; provides three different tools for sho@@ ots available . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ny images . &quot;
un@@ sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like an image sharp@@ ly . actually it does not work to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
&quot; focuss@@ ing is perhaps the best of the three , because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt . &quot;
&quot; photos without a focus , as well as most digi@@ tised images need to summari@@ ze the sound process colors with only minimal differences to a colour point . the same phenomenon can be observed if colours are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more detri@@ mental than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; with JP@@ EG pictures , a camera is often applied to internal sc@@ iss@@ al . pictures in the blank format must always be sharpen@@ ed during the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner is using a foam filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable this , you get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you will be able to receive ch@@ able results by shar@@ pen a photo with the h@@ acking value . this allows you to log in with the menu entry of basket .
&quot; you should be careful however , because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also intensi@@ fying the smoke . you can also achieve further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool to adjust sof@@ tly with the menu entry basket and experiment with settings . the thumb@@ nails on the right side of the dialog is showing you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview allows the image to process . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often create good results and should be tried out first . an increase of radius or amount will reinforce the effect . if you make the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask too strongly , smokers will generate noise and the impression of grass in the proximity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edges has been affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen them best in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the original image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the swelling value is a split from the maximum R@@ GB value and the differential amount . thus , these areas are used with a soft change between the sounds of shar@@ pen and hence glow in facial , Heav@@ ens and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ hing Filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a Corpor@@ a = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; checking came ; tool re@@ focused on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to identify the protected unfolding filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
&quot; this tool tries to read a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focuss@@ ing quot ; in which it is a better approach than to try to shar@@ pen the photo . the traditional technique for the sharpen@@ ing of images is the use of a wi@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by setting colors Re@@ focus in image editing . &quot;
&quot; in practice the circular fly works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which results in most cases even very strongly influenced by the original pixel . this causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular loop : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images the default value should result in 1 good results . you can put a higher value if your picture is very bl@@ ur@@ red but then on Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filter : an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values higher than 0,@@ 1 can be low . however , the image quality is very poor . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will keep the picture still further . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , so you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the smoking filter . &quot;
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational size . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results . however , note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the area of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try all the cutting , color and Inten@@ sity correc@@ tions on the image before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible immediately , but the later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts leave . &quot;
&quot; if you read pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ hing better results as sc@@ iss@@ ors . this could be caused by causing the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood as a sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , the result of the F@@ IR filter has never to remove ar@@ te@@ facts . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimum linear filter . the F@@ IR filter filter is often better at the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attributable to insufficient light for auto @-@ focus lenses .
&quot; for more information on the methods of the sc@@ iss@@ ing in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator Gl@@ ät@@ te sets the in@@ shar@@ pen of the area that was dark@@ ened to generate a natural p@@ ac@@ ille .
&quot; the color tin@@ ts allows a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool det@@ ector is one of the most sophisticated tool to remove the desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the owner has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starter points to simplify the restoration . the options available are listed below :
&quot; in case you want to use the filtering settings to you , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail@@ ing regul@@ p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of details . a small value leads to a even@@ ly smooth@@ ed over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be careful about the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be noted , please note that the detail@@ led position always should be subordin@@ ate . &quot;
Ri@@ ding dependence of Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ ed even@@ ly in all directions while a value close to 1 is only in one direction . if you create a movie gran@@ ularity or CCD Rau@@ e will create a high value in wave @-@ like patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts will best be eliminated with a value close to 1 .
&quot; &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ation factor above all@@ ot@@ p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , set this value to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is multiplied , because it is then difficult to create the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ ck effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : returns how often the algorithm is going through . usually here is 1 or 2 out .
&quot; angle gradual since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha small is chosen , it should also be small chosen . therefore , be sure to choose small angles a long term . so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to suit your needs . &quot;
integrated step &#91; 0.@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de @-@ wide in pixels . you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality that you get through a choice of this option is only minor . but he doubles the term . we recommend it to allow him to release it .
the buttons to save as and store exactly this . any settings correct can correct this file saved into a text file and later relo@@ aded .
&quot; correct graphical errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button break@@ out . &quot;
below you can see how graphical errors can be removed using little ar@@ te@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that is caused in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is an independent black fact during the journey caused by a poor film deposit while the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; checking came ; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce imaging . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters available to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensors from camera or Mo@@ i@@ ding ; - effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
if you need further information on sensor modes of digital cameras so you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular smo@@ ker that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time that the filters are used per pixel and can smooth@@ ed the image above the picture and the color in it is smooth@@ ed , and therefore smaller bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the noise level . this value sets the pixel stand@@ ings to determine the light weight changes . if it is increased , smokers will need to change the channel filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and smoke or lubrication again . &quot;
edges : controls the cant@@ onal accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong does not remove the whole smo@@ ker or smokers can occur . put him on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a watch@@ dog or JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controlled the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or light density to change in order to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of using the details settings .
color : controls the color intolerance of the picture . we recommend either color or light density to improve one image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of using the details settings .
gam@@ ma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas which typically have stronger bol@@ ted to increase . however , it disappeared also to the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ atter@@ d@@ amping . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filtration radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges can occur when it is too high , ru@@ stling and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur to the edges . he can remove rou@@ gh@@ s and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; storing and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction , which you have set , can be saved into the file system and loaded later . &quot;
this is an example of how smokers can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) and the scre@@ ams was applied with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to shar@@ pen the image a little soft , fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen it is fortunately much easier than an image to shar@@ pen . use the pad@@ lock on the right side of the dialog box , showing the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; checking came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photographs .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted ar@@ te@@ facts from your pictures . it is very good adapted to removing Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ en , compres@@ sor , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sor factory , and local errors that arise in digital , original or subsequent digi@@ tised images . the smooth@@ ing is done along the picture cont@@ ours and thus maintains the content as well as the human eye . &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for color and text replacement . the textile composition is carried out with another tool that has been implemented by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ osis and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy comb@@ usti@@ ble compres@@ sor ; - small standards that are seen in the un@@ compressed picture . this attitude should correct these problems . &quot;
buttons save as and store exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can thus be saved into a text file and then loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ aming .
&quot; below you can reduce like a photo with equality noise .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film bas@@ kets on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected one below ( 2 ) . &quot;
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old colour photo that was applied with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows it hot@@ pieces of photos that were filled with a CCD camera , eight were to remove . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem , since many cameras with JP@@ EG compression over a built @-@ in repression of hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pixel@@ quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pixel quot ; in a photo with a dark image method to remove . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file into the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly next to the new hot or bright pixel by the CCD defects .
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the corrected image . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and automatically loads this automatically during the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview can help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all previous areas .
choose an area around the defective pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter . choose the best filters method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ cut : it is determined an average of the neighboring pixel . the resulting color will be assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a gap of 1 of the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to pixel block will be drawn to a bi @-@ square surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
chew@@ ed : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ k@@ ub@@ ic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ ic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ ic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was enlarged at 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ lt @-@ correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. sub@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; fores@@ ee@@ able objective , particularly those in the middle and large photo format , can often light the whole sensor area . instead , they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that achieves the sensor there . Tele@@ objective may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he has also cons . many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . fores@@ ee@@ pers should also use Center filters , an opening of f / 16 or small , since otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ed @-@ effects are created by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the great popularity ranges of today &apos;s film or gra@@ ves of digital cameras and movie scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by sim@@ ulated the transformation of a Center@@ filter based on a picture . the tool is protected by John Walker . &quot;
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tive filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption on the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which reduce the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ aire , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the processing of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is reduced by the ligh@@ tening of the target with these options . the regul@@ ators provide you with only positive values , since you only have to raise the settings . &quot;
if you want a fin@@ iss@@ ing of the exposure of the target image so let the values for illumin@@ ating / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; checking ; image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correctly applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ aire and contrast @-@ correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; checking came ; Lin@@ sen@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . color@@ fully distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second Gra@@ des treats the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the picture .
&quot; the coefficient of the third gradient has a similar connection effect , but fla@@ cht in the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the coefficient of Gra@@ des corrected the distant corners to the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion can be eliminated almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second engra@@ ving . with negative values , tons can be corrected , and positive values can be cr@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the gradient . this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameters has turned the &apos; corners of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus creates a correction first engra@@ ving by . negative values enlarge while positive the picture reduced .
&quot; bright : this value j@@ us@@ ks the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filtering settings , the dialog with a preview of the configuration correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used in the next start as standard values . &quot;
the ble@@ w or cut@@ ted correction should be performed before all feed or size changes . at the best you can cut this correction as all the first . if you want to re@@ cut a picture and carry out a sample @-@ shaped correction then the effect would be obvious .
&quot; to help you find the best correction is available to you this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse button in the image window , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the de@@ fl@@ ection of the lines with the help of lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cr@@ ashes distor@@ tion , the resulting image black corners will have . you can transform this with the cutting tool in the menu , cut off the image editing or about the zoom regul@@ ator of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the sample @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives like e.g. recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct the all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the sample @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) can be seen .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared movie of the G@@ imp@@ belt belt available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the famous Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film . see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity zone of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can preview the area for the preview . if you look at the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview allows you to adjust two parameters , setup and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the options to sim@@ ulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive movie . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film gran@@ ularity and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow ! &quot;
&quot; as the filter dy@@ es can be used to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photographs since colour information is missing . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of an infrared fil@@ ament applied to a landscap@@ ing photo from New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) , and the original picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the movie was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra into the Spit@@ z . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter movie gran@@ ularity is a simple to use tool to reproduce films on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed cinem@@ as such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturer mix great silver bodies of the photo em@@ ulsion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or appears to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , shr@@ ubs sight , especially in your mono@@ chro@@ mium photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the gra@@ ins can be calibr@@ ated . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , so you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the footage effect on a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the edited ( 2 ) . used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; checking came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; checking came ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature patterns and styles are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush @-@ size between one and five out . thicker brushes are suitable for great pictures . smooth@@ es controls the smooth@@ ed or , from the other side , the sever@@ ity . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter cohesion is used in colour and Inten@@ sity . the lines that change the outlines in the drawing are stressed , therefore , if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would have good pictures to begin with it . &quot;
there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator chooses the pin size and the lower dem@@ arc@@ ates the contrast ( smooth@@ ed ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ence filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved due to adjustments to the intention .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ acked in wax . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the engra@@ ving came ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to re @-@ give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ y landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . the maximum depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and look it as if it is considered by gl@@ ass@@ ures .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to w@@ avel@@ ength 1 the picture is distor@@ ted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects at any time with the button Be@@ aming .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of in@@ shar@@ pen effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image along st@@ ern@@ fo@@ erde lines taking a point out . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al ignor@@ es : caught the image by rotation of the pixels at a central point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
removal of removal : caught the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
&quot; movement of movement : wi@@ ping the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the ir@@ regul@@ arities of a linear linear , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
sof@@ tening Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the image soft in the dark and strongly in the light tones . this produces photos with a dream@@ y and shiny gl@@ oss effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our @-@ photos or to add a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the ir@@ regul@@ arities of an arbitrary camera .
intelligent in@@ shar@@ pen : finds the color in the picture and wi@@ pe it without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel value . &quot;
&quot; some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation anytime with the button below . &quot;
the rainy drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures an intimate look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyrighted algorithm .
dri@@ ppers are allowed to change the size of the drop . because the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically reduce the size for small pictures . number changes the quantity and density of the drops . fish changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
&quot; you can keep using the &amp; checking ; image editing an area freely of rain drops . use the selection tool to select the area , for example a face if you want to stay free . if you want to start the filter Re@@ pair , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rainy filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be transformed in the menu , transform or transform mirrors . &quot;
photograph is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo for a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to reduce is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information here ? how can you find the missing information here again . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can change it on the size size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is visible below .
&quot; the tool to adjust the size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for recording . &quot;
many image editing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tised ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo lab@@ eled by the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
aspect ratio : when this setting is activated is maintained when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image .
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is multiplied , because it is then difficult to create the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons to save as well as store are used exactly for this . any st@@ aging for photo can be saved as text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo p@@ ases is very fast where it makes , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after you . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; you can see an example of photo bub@@ bles , by adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) is the result of linear standard magnific@@ ation compared . &quot;
&quot; cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . the image editing , you need to simply create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle , then you will see the mouse while you move your mouse . &quot;
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview as your photo after cutting . you can change the size of the cutting area by clicking on the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle can simply drag it with the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the inc@@ ision , use the button the cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file file storage or file storage in the menu file to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the higher value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you can use cen@@ timet@@ res , ink or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to cent@@ ering the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
&quot; below in dialog , you can set the area with the Max . relationship button for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tik@@ al ) , these settings are displayed as standard values depending on the orientation . the modified image dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the merger assistance enable assistance to show , so that you can better put your pictures better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmonious triangle : harmon@@ ic fac@@ tions are based on the principle of the similarity . as the third @-@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal tri@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; Golden Center : the golden center is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us mus@@ sels or the mart@@ ins of a sun@@ flower . it emerges in all kinds of things we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden partition is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used for the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , which thereby used your temples and pyram@@ ids in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number leads from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 21 , and is regarded as visual harmon@@ i@@ ously . &quot;
the golden center provides li@@ que@@ er auxiliary lines when you put together a picture . these help are enum@@ er@@ ated below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ re@@ gel the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
&quot; another rule is called the corner of golden spiral , also known as gold corner . it should be used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye can be in the center of the composition . that can be a line or take different objects . this something can be simply because of the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
the Golden tri@@ angles also run from the golden spiral . your ver@@ tices are the middle points of the side of the golden rectangle . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . Di@@ agon@@ als can be placed on these lines can be a static object of dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to set up your frame create an effect of professional photo@@ grap@@ hing dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options horizont@@ ally reflect and tik@@ al can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic realms .
with the button color you can set the color of the Help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the aid line can be invisible . this way you can customize the color of lines on your current image .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to shoot a picture at any angle .
&quot; if you do a photo then it happens easily , that you are not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things turned around an angle . you can fix this with the mind ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform free rotation and j@@ us@@ hes the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your picture with the sli@@ der angles . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button preferences , you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degree . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right side . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor into the image to position the two lines . after you fix it over an important point of the picture . now , you can fix the angle as in previous section . &quot;
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is the function transforms the function transforms into image editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ an transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
in order to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that have emerged through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that have emerged through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right up : displays the current angle in degree at the top right of the transformed area .
angle left bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degree at the bottom right corner of the transform@@ ate area .
&quot; after adapting the perspective the image will be a little bit lubric@@ ated . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid it if possible . &quot;
after having adapted the perspective you get un@@ joy@@ ous tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an opportunity to fres@@ hen it to some is to cut the picture with transform you cut out of image processing .
&quot; the tool system is used to move part of the image into one direction and move the other part in the opposite side . this is no rotation , the picture is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a Parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can transform this module over transform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; use your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . you can push horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press on preferences , the angle on zero will display you and the new dimensions of the target are displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; to your help you get a vertical and horizontal line . move your mouse into an important point , such as the lake , a wall from one building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the control tool to get your picture . &quot;
&quot; after you have performed the lubrication , the picture becomes a bit confused . for a single lubrication , this effect is usually dro@@ pping , twice as much embarrass@@ ment and hence , you should avoid this . &quot;
after the lubrication the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transform you cut out of image processing .
&quot; came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the type such as these libraries comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to process a large number of image formats . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF including . &quot;
&quot; that came ; only files in formats will be familiar with the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension was listed in the list . if the extension was listed in the file editing , you can edit this list of file expan@@ sions . you can read this list of file expan@@ sions . in the section configuration you will find more information . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to even select the format used . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; check ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compres@@ sing on digital pictures . the redund@@ ant information is reduced to this way the image data is stored on a more efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JP@@ EG at the same compression status . the 200@@ 0s can also save a loss when it is stated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to find out more about the raw image format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format pictures in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the raw feature converter from &amp; checking . in the section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; checking . &quot;

select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the shade menu on the left side .
&quot; graph@@ ene viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ ene ; graph@@ ene . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science , especially in computer sciences . so far , there have been no modern &amp; GUI . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ ene ; includes , according to the program &apos;s author obsol@@ ete &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; - programs with only a few functions . &quot;
this project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graph@@ ene ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graphically ; -@@ dot . the &amp; graph@@ ene ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ ene ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ ene in &amp; K@@ ate ; the graphs are re@@ calculated and in &amp; graph@@ ed viewer ;
menu to open the graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or open the graph@@ ene in &amp; graph@@ ene ; in a &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
&quot; download big graph@@ ers ( currently , there are problems of about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these knots ) &quot;
&quot; additional software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; is a &amp; k@@ d ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graphic ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are required . &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the open graphs , each in a separate window . at first , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; without an argument , the toolbar can only open the symbol file and the ( blank ) list Zul@@ te files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot , the main window looks like in the lower screenshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the character . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special @-@ keys , left and right at tor@@ tured &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum loading of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just changed in a different program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h should be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change , so later , you can change your decision later , you can set up the menu item Settings viewer ; set up ... see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a Grap@@ hic file outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; an instance open , on the file browser or at the command line , you have the option to open whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; an instance or want to display the download@@ able graphs in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can permanently save your choice , but change them with the furnishing dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both and later . &quot;
you can also set how the Grap@@ h should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
&quot; when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs that are to be missed on this page . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graphs . &quot;
page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without head@@ line and with another font .
&quot; the page again gives the possibility to define the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard disk , a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ charging or modify the changes ) or the program can be requested any time . &quot;
&quot; the page Open gives the opportunity to set the behavior of &amp; c@@ graphically ; if a graph is opened outside of a current session . you can open a standard behaviour in a new window , or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) , or determine that each time you are asked . &quot;
the site management department is the possibility to set up the start@@ up of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; you can set a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if required at any start .
&quot; the context menu , which is usually released by clicking on the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; it opens up further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; gra@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layer algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ ene ; are :
&quot; the algorithm , the standard for specific graph@@ ers . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tions of directed graphs . the algorithm puts the edges into the same direction ( from above to bottom or from left to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ ons as possible . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for invalid graph@@ ers . it produces depic@@ tions according to the spr@@ ing@@ board model . it is used the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for un@@ eri@@ ded graph@@ ene a spr@@ ing@@ model design . he uses the frustration @-@ clean gold he@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ sh@@ attered timer to treat large and geological graphs .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm ranks the node circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should add special options as parameters , and the calculated layout of Grap@@ h after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can give special options , or even the graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ eri@@ ed ) and uses the standard algorithms for the respective type ( dot , targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for invalid graph@@ ene ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse cursor . click with this mouse pointer to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get more help to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ log in the base folder of the source .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ ene ; tools to display . it requires the following programs :
a special furnishings are not necessary to use &amp; paste . in the menu Settings can be found further options .
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five ranges : the main toolbar , the bar for string tools , the status bar , the .@@ Color palette and the grid network , in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; created a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you will ask if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog where you can choose whether the symbol of a template is to be created , or if you want to restart it from scratch . &quot;
&quot; rest@@ ores the last revers@@ ed step again . if you do not have a step back , this function is disabled . &quot;
insert the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray levels . this can create colors that do not agree with those of the icon range of &amp; k@@ sy ;
&quot; doesn &apos;t change the symbol , but puts the current character color on the color of the point you click on . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current promotions . from left to right , it shows you the X@@ - and y coordinates of the current Pix@@ els , the size of the current drawing space , the magni@@ fier factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
insert the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images can be read tools available to redeem new images and add them to them .
this module can be used to redeem new images from external sources and split up . currently two sources can be used :
pictures scans : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner which supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as video streams . so that this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
&quot; when you want to scan the menu item , you will be able to select a dialog that you want to choose between all available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will be replaced by selecting the default default values in order to select your image accordingly before you see the image below . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information . &quot;
note that the window will be completely displayed as some settings otherwise possibly can not be displayed .
&quot; after you have pushed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window will specify the options of the image file . here you can also select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; or create the image file . &quot;
screen@@ shots you can create after you select in the menu Import &gt; Screen photo ... selected . a window appears in which you can set the different screen f@@ ot@@ om@@ o@@ di .
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if All of your program will be selected , the call@@ back program will disappear , so you can read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be able to read the entire desktop , only the window under the mouse will be read . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long the screenshot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work areas , you should select this delay high enough to get the time there . &quot;
&quot; after the screenshot was completed , the dialog options of the target image is displayed with the options described above . &quot;

&quot; with the options open , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e you can adjust the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as a private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is recorded in maximum size with maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size will be constant that the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows GPS Co@@ ordin@@ ates to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of a picture and the loc@@ alisation is displayed in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alisation can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools available to locate images geo@@ graphically in spherical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Geo@@ graphical localization cor@@ relative . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and then call the menu . of course , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains of course data that were taken at the same locations as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
if the file loaded a automatic correlation that displays the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and hence the camera can be done with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
&quot; the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . lies the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace data from one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this field .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and differential in min. can be used if you do not have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality a locom@@ otive in a big difference between camera and GPS is , you can set this limits and then press the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have taken a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog will notice the coordinates of a call to the next you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
&quot; the locom@@ otive can also be found with the shown card and enlarge . choose this the relevant region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually . the card can always be changed manually . the map can be replaced between ticket mode , satellite screen and a mixed mode . &quot;
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang out the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ bition is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages and provide the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ded to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four hor@@ semen where the settings can be adjusted . the rider selection allows you to choose those albums . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly choose a large number of albums . in the section below the Al@@ ben@@ ign look and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page will appear .
&quot; the rider image defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely explained by itself . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed on the picture . otherwise the picture will be displayed directly with your default image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , &quot;
&quot; the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all of your related images . select a folder that you have to write . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ p@@ export , which contains everything will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures are also saved in the new pictures . &quot;
with other color depth you can change the standard color depth . the file of course also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
&quot; the rider thumb@@ nails allows you some of the settings from the album rider for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user on how far the action is . press abor@@ ting to break the process .
&quot; when the module has created the site , the window will not automatically shut down . you can therefore start the program@@ ing results , to determine if errors are performed during production . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press Connect to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image fun@@ nel is a very fast and flexible OpenGL tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image , it allows you to view a selection of images and use them for basic operations like filming , zo@@ oming or scre@@ wing . the viewer can be used with short images and mouse clicks . it has been developed for fast viewing and quick access to its functions . &quot;
after starting a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG @-@ free module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save the actions below , images in JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses of quality and metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss of losses is that the file size increases , since there is no compression of color information . this can be found e.g. at the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Digital Cam Cli@@ mb@@ one is a tool to enable you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Digital Cam Cli@@ mb@@ era currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module Met@@ adata module currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of metadata you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the image dialog with which you want to copy the image file . the data will be copied after you hit the button OK .
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please look at exi@@ bition 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of slideshow .
&quot; all pictures will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can create a background color for slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player , including the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; you will first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can start using extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
the pictures selected by you are then enum@@ er@@ ated in image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the images or the content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should choose the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image will be specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth @-@ change . &quot;
the background color can be adjusted as next . in doubt you should leave them black . the name and path of the created file you can specify at the name of MPEG @-@ output files .
&quot; if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after you can re@@ boot the production of the movie , depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee and enjoy the slides if you &apos;re back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that co@@ ding or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings on the right below . &quot;
the printer driver allows multiple images to print on a sheet of paper together in standard images . these combined images can also automatically be opened with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve your or using the Gimp module for direct printing .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your files to one of three formats of JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original editor of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w , that it creates the same results as the software from your camera results . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears in the mode for a single picture . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now re@@ use the values new to optimize the conver@@ sions process . the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for the whit@@ eboard . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be j@@ us@@ hed . if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later on . &quot;
&quot; a four colors R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the output results . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the loss of free L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to work on your pictures frequently or select later otherwise , you should not choose the JP@@ EG format before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
if you choose JP@@ EG as a storage format the metadata are included in the RA@@ W file in the JP@@ EG file stored in the EX@@ IF data .
&quot; if you adjust your settings to you , you can start downloading the conversion . if you want to break this process again , you can use it to break down . &quot;
&quot; the stack processing mode allows you to convert various pictures at one time . therefore , use this mode once you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the option to automatically over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful , if it is produced in an earlier attempt . however , the progress bar is not available . the progress bar is not available as far the conversion . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the time stamp of the file . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . you can reduce the image to reduce the image or enlarge .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal scale change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 ) : size changes in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : dis@@ proportionate scale change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; preparation preparation : prepared the picture for the photo print . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , side size and background color , is accordingly adjusted . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail programme . it is also possible to change the size of the additional images in advance . you can also drag and drop images on the list of images below .
&quot; after you started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the pictures selected . you can add further images using a file sel@@ ector dialog . for the last selected picture , a preview picture will be shown on the right side . &quot;
you can also drag and drop images on the picture list and add it to the pictures below .
&quot; with the button pictures , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be displayed . &quot;
after you have selected all images you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are already attached .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of the remaining emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send a lot of images .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used again until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the GM@@ ail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after submitting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files as e.g. TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG , if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
if you select JP@@ EG among pictures file format and the original files in the JP@@ EG format are then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the measured pictures .
&quot; if the process is ready , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status . your e @-@ mail programme will be started automatically at the end . with the button Connect , you can drag this window ? &quot;
&quot; after starting the module &apos;s advanced di@@ ch@@ au , a window with questions like you will have shown your slideshow . you can select here between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL @-@ transi@@ tions in the presentation will enable very elegant images by OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphical card because otherwise the slides will be very slow . &quot;
the option file name indicates that the file name is displayed in the lower right corner during the presentation .
the loop strap ensures that the presentation is displayed in a final loop . you can then break it manually with Es@@ c ; ab@@ rupt .
the option images random@@ ly choose to ensure that the images are shown in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
&quot; among the images you can set the tempor@@ al distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1,5 seconds and are a good standard . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should draw this before you show the presentation your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions among which you can choose . random@@ ly choose another effect in each transition between the pictures .
&quot; during the slideshow , you can access a toolbar on the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the whole number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module generates the currently selected picture , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your KDE worker . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , see you with &amp; k@@ cart , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , so in people , places and in the group tags . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories , for which you have entered information as you have entered your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
if you select another person only the images are shown on which both persons are shown . through this selection method you can restrict the number of images shown from a few thousand pictures to some individual images .
&quot; if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view with screen@@ shots in order to view the images of your range . &quot;
&quot; in the picture any person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photographs ; however , for each person a private thumb@@ nails , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you themselves have defined . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; in order to view images next to the names , select the button that you want to adjust to the right outside on the toolbar . this has the advantage that you can view for example symbols with images of people and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you do not have any suitable images ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must decide which image should be displayed for each individual person . in order to display this , you need to select the picture editor window ( in closer described ) and select the image file for the corresponding person . in the App@@ endi@@ x window you can customize the picture factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image will be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the entry window in the main window , a dialog will display a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for the fixed of the image properties . this dialog can be seen in the picture once again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field lab@@ eling or description , the marking and descriptions of the images go through to this text . if you like , you can also use a date to be searched for example ; the date may be either a part of the entire dat@@ ory , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images of certain names as you can see in the picture . here is pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene pictured . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ cart . . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but prefer to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this handbook : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photographs ; and take a look at the Travel@@ er , the screen@@ shots and the introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ cart album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photographs ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu item on the menu item , or select some sample pictures and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ cart . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photographs ; as an integrated HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photographs ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data on the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can preview the indicated entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview map ) and in addition , the tim@@ eline will always be shown the current date of the currently indicated pictures if you navigate in the preview View . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ est@@ ments , you &apos;ll be displayed in the preview view only images of this period , by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; set up on two options available to create HTML websites with your images . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photographs ; the following part of the user manual is available in &amp; k@@ photographs ; integrated version , which you can create HTML from the menu file HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and destination . in the following , each section is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the window and describe a description which is to be included in the HTML file . on k@@ photographs , HTML example pages you see an example of these settings . &quot;
next select whether a &amp; k@@ cart album is to be created ; export file is to be seen on the review page . nutritional information about export files can be found in .
&quot; last , you can select which information will be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . for example , that all pictures of a party are obvious . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . for example , all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewer . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambiguous , which is why not specifically received . &quot;
&quot; below on the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images . this way , those who consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no pictures will download a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set . so , he can browse your pictures with low resolution , which results at a lower transmission time , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folder and the URL that your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder where all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . you can either select a folder or a KDE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is all required for viewers . if you choose a URL for the basic folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL you should be here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the use of you created HTML files not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy it to the final destination folder . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described just described are all three on basic folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family business , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photographs ; however , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . if you want to enter an HTML page for viewing the pictures , then you have to enter into the pictures , recording location , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ cart . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ cart album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import a copy of your images into a file . the picture characteristics will be imported with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the images are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage of all images can share with you and share this file independent . the obvious disadvantage is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the images in two @-@ fold way . first , the images are not found , the images are indicated in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the export of images is described , which you can export over the menu file export ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should act by internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; when Manual is paste to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atically copied to the .@@ k@@ im file copy , copy the images automatically . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal ZIP files . since most pictures have been compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files so you simply select the option export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you want to send your friends images , because the .@@ k@@ im file might be very large . here you can limit the size by example , that each image is at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Import ... select &amp; k@@ cart album ; the exported database as described in .
&quot; the wizard for imports consists of four steps . first , you have to select which images you want to import , in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are supposed to person@@ alize the category persons of the imported file ( if you are a sw@@ ans ) , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog box , which categories of the imported file are to be imported and what category these categories are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can choose the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . an example for this can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be simple to browse and watch pictures : if you want to see images , you often want to see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your boyfriend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this guide you will go through the various steps from ( 1 ) fixing the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the search and reputation , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation possibilities . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual , more pictures are spoken , but frequently , this also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; saves all of your information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , which you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. standardization backup tools , backup , on a flo@@ ppy disk or revisions in the CV@@ S , where they would like . &quot;
&quot; watch the folder in which your pictures are saved and used this in future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to start another database in &amp; k@@ cart . if you want to start another database in &amp; k@@ cart . as example : k@@ cart album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; using the menu entry settings , set up ... you will be able to set up a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photographs ; in the following section of the user manual , the different settings are explained . &quot;
&quot; links you can see six different symbols , with which you can preview the preview options and options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help you can access the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described in detail how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog that is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete members groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group address instead of all groups of a single member state as in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the settings options available to you for the set @-@ up of the members groups . with the header selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left @-@ Fen@@ st@@ acks there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; watch his modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . nutritional information is available on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can be described and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photographs ; however , most modules have a help @-@ page that you can access over the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules of multiple applications can be shared among each other , it may be very little tested using the command line . therefore , you should always view new modules first with the demo database . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules using K@@ IP@@ I together , are very different , allowing it to be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photographs ; not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photographs ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications does not support their images in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photographs ; this kind of order does not support the order in albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ cart . &quot;
&quot; the current album sim@@ ulates , the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album , the album has to pass a list of albums . here is also a list of albums handed over . here goes &amp; k@@ photographs ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ cart album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category , which you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , will be used for example , if you have selected people selected to view and pass this module . &quot;
&quot; because some modules are using &amp; k@@ photographs ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select in the area modules that are loaded modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a boot screen when you start &amp; k@@ cart ; with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , take a look at the top of a menu and a toolbar . at the moment we will not get information about your pictures . in the section we will return to this window , now click the picture to show you an overview with all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ cart album ; is the possibility to view every image with notes , where the picture was recorded , etc . you can put each image individually or for a larger number of pictures certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pictured and all pictures in Copenhagen were added . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you will see three lists with a text field by setting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photographs ; because you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; following the following idea lies the moving of images within the list : if you are depicted for example a family party , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be depicted , so that the used names are moved upwards to find the persons more quickly and easily . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get a alphabe@@ tical list displayed , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected comments for each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images and add these images to ann@@ ot@@ ations . click in this case just to the front and back kno@@ bs that are on the top of the picture on the top . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all of these images and add the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that this is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the &quot; &quot; context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also drop an entry into a category and place it there to sort this one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires that you just sort your categories in alphabe@@ tical order . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the material , by clicking the box that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by clicking it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; when you adjust the look of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and look of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can leave a frame also completely . if you want to get this window again later , use the button options ... and here window will see a / hide . this procedure can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; select the entry images in the browser , you will find an overview with thumb@@ nails of currently selected pictures , or of all images in case you don &apos;t have a filter here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply click on drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , simply try it . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a picture in the background of your desktop , this picture is furnished as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this is shown in the picture below . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture of the picture , a new indicator window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images . simply select the respective pictures from you , and select either the Del@@ ete button or select either the Edit menu . now you will see the window you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the images stored anywhere without you on the hard disk . of course , you have to record the pictures somewhere , so you can download the pictures anywhere ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures where the right upper edge is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are available , so you can see the preview of these images . however , you can also view these pictures with the picture . &quot;
&quot; as you see this function , that you need files from folders and copy it into it . so if you do not want to avoid the inser@@ tion of your pictures , please buy a larger disk in order to save all the images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , check the images so that at the end those you want to see for others and click on the current view . alternatively , you can also view all the pictures that may see your little sister , con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ers and the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; with this , you have set out which images can be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to get the laptop with your little sister , simply select the menu item you want to have blocked , and if you want to get the pictures again , click Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that has to be entered into the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for instance , all images on the hard disk and the other can access the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml , the password used as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to we@@ aving the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason you want to describe all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photographs ; of course , you will be able to view it . of course , that you want to look at some point . for this reason , this reason has a picture _ and video reference . this is why you can preview the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can be seen in the viewer . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you enter into the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box you want to see on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can also configure which information is displayed and whether the information is displayed on the viewer . all these options are displayed after a right @-@ click on the viewer . then you can see the menu menu below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries on this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can jump between them and jump back by using the keys picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as a slideshow . as frequently it can load a new image after a few seconds . how frequently it &apos;s a new image can be controlled by pressing the tr@@ l button and plus or minus . start and stopped the gas@@ ket by keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
&quot; a very useful ability to change the spect@@ ator of &amp; k@@ photographs ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can use the picture in the picture and pull out a rectangle . with the minus key you can get back down the plus key zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not shown on the zoom , so that every pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations will work with videos that are in and out of the plus with the plus and the key .
with the screen@@ shots from the context menu you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen you can see a picture with a person whose name you will have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view the picture and configuration dialog of the picture to enter this name . but you will perhaps consider only the picture to mark and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad as you look one by one .
&quot; for the two examples at the top gives you the opportunity to add pictures with features , while you can view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature that you press the appropriate letters . in the picture you can see an image , where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set characteristics of your pictures , these are available to you in your browser . so if you have all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and particularly characteristics can be displayed in the preview view . if you display categories in D@@ re preview view , then you can press the features to the pictures by pressing the letters for the feature when the picture was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case allows you to paint a photo@@ graphies ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your painted later . &quot;
&quot; in turn , you can see a picture on the painted . to turn on the picture paint from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you need to control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not completely re@@ master , but the documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the object characteristics and the object is shown in the wire mo@@ v views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , as all sig@@ objects already have been selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position that you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following listing is built menu , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with delete either from the menu bar , using edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove even selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click on to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a fault description . then you can edit the input errors and apply again or change the modifications . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the furnishing dialog , you can view the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the object shown with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 h@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 has already included the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the map view . &quot;
&quot; press the thumb@@ nail plate and a small example of the scene with the selected texture . as pres@@ et@@ ting , the entire texture will be chosen , even if you want to have a subordin@@ ated element ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally . &quot;
the screenshot showing the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visual @-@ level model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the higher @-@ level object , or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visual grade or equal in the toolbar of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window rules as pres@@ et@@ ting . the object tree and the view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard shut@@ down order , or if you need any other arrangement , you can store them any desired . you can also store multiple windows orders and simply switch between different adap@@ tations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window on or below a table view , drag the beginning water to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning water to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on each other , draw the beginning water in the middle of another view . you can then change between the views by clicking the cardboard boxes on the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window rules are so@@ aking views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the beginning water to the desktop or click on the small to the left corner of the cable . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the an@@ alogy bar . to prevent the left , click the little square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for every kind of views . new views are s@@ web@@ end , you can anchor it on any location . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can save you with view Window System ... save a dialog , where you can save the window rules below an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; when you created a scene , you can ren@@ ame them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
to ren@@ ders the current scene click on the icon Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ dering in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels you can insert any number of r@@ ender modes from a quick preview of up to full images .
&quot; when you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the toolbar , or in the View Samples ... select the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that can detect the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the straight image . if you want to ren@@ ame a small area of the picture , select the cross field and enter the image @-@ out to the ren@@ ders into the input fields . &quot;
in the Com@@ bin@@ ational field quality you can select the characteristics that use &amp; Pov@@ ray . this goes from a very simple paint and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual &amp; Pov@@ ray .
&quot; when a picture is rounded with only one beam per pixel , there can often be different mistakes . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or piece @-@ effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are in the representation smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the influence of these errors . in general , pictures with this feature is better off . &quot;
&quot; if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ uted and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because every pixel is always split and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion@@ ing loop depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; when you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray controls a beam per pixel . if the difference between the shades of pixels with super @-@ sampling , then both pixel will be calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated with a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixels . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values the pre @-@ defined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be followed individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with lowering . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of smoking for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn j@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount , to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last adjustment for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray . it takes a very long to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this card card , you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent , if the associated beams have not met an object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Pov@@ ray . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray , select the menu item imports ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet fully supports the full commands of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; when considering error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you want to write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene and drag it to the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also fit .
POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; click on help in the map view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . put the path to your document and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ loc@@ ates ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you incorporate files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also have to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color will be used to display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the ch@@ equ@@ es for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type labels .
&quot; you can set the object catch of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; bigger values result in more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the objects shown , but require more time to rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed amplifier for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross High detailed proj@@ ections for extended proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the wall , a wall is rolled behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you show ground h@@ ubs , a floor is covered below the objects . the floor is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enable the c@@ utter registration , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window rules , you can create and store Window orders . &quot;
the Com@@ bin@@ ational field Standard @-@ window order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the selected window rules when starting the program .
&quot; the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be added with the button Add , and delete a selected arrangement with the button removal . &quot;
every window rules will be identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the selected window rules . new views can delete you with the button add and select selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column , you will create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with the included window , you &apos;ll get a card hand view together with the previous view and vibr@@ ating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : install and now you want to follow without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but easy scene , a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you complain about it as a result you can get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not stop a camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ ders as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you get only a black picture . &quot;
if you have everything error @-@ free then you will see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : the following pres@@ et window rules :
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . read the documentation , so you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item to delete . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . especially note that in the fourth wire @-@ model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this is the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of the View properties tab in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera will change in the viewing points with which you can change the way@@ point of the camera . simply click on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button , or press the input , change the wire @-@ model views and the object @-@ tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a qui@@ ader ( inser@@ tion body Qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an optional method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually provides an easy way . you can use an infinite level as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the name and press then use the button . in the object tree the new name will immediately be shown . &quot;
&quot; the wire @-@ model view now also shows the level , though at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plain extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look carefully the object tree , you will notice that you click on the symbol + before the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit among the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shifting and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; just choose the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but select a little one at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog where you can select how the object is to be inserted . please choose the item in the object tree ( name = soil pig@@ ments ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view , see how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pig@@ ments preview is only a matt black material , because you have to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , think that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities but take the easiest . &quot;
&quot; if you look in the preview of any color on Qu@@ ader and sphere , then click the button to apply and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now correct . if you are running your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you have expected to enter two new attributes . in the Far@@ y@@ list you need to do two new attributes . then choose this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the chess board @-@ color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
select in the object tree jed@@ es@@ mal and change the colors in the view of the item characteristics :
&quot; this step should you already be able to run , since you should have understood the basic methods of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball is just as easy as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input file or button to push ) so that the ball over the floor would float above the bottom , since you have moved the floor to bottom a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ der@@ ings now yields a strange result : how to see before , the ball @-@ surface as a matt black material . put it in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already on the ground , type the ball a pig@@ ment as colour : &quot;
&quot; choose First sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ments . click on sphere pig@@ ments , select then einf@@ ar@@ big and put the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click apply or press Enter .
&quot; the attitudes of shine @-@ effect and reflection arise already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : even if metallic : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ pricing is a R@@ ender method to create a two dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ed a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ed off the ren@@ derer off the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which impact the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene and how can affect atmospheric effects such as fog . thus , the scene pixels edited for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will be able to see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye on which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be controlled , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
open a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and space . &quot;
&quot; rest@@ ores the scene in the last saved version , all changes since the last storage will be rejected . &quot;
you can only select this menu item if you do not have stored any stored changes in the scene .
&quot; repeatedly , the last und@@ own command . this menu item can only then select if you have used editing . &quot;
&quot; saves the current window rules and opens a dialog , where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the standard behaviour . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new orders to this option using this option .
opens up a dialog to set up the toolbar icons . you can add and remove tool@@ ing icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler .
a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to get rough surfaces without any b@@ ump on the surface separately and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a real appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by using a image file as a color card .
&quot; &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable portrait and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can select images for viewing . &quot;
images can be displayed either in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of a ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the button Return .
&quot; you can set whether any image will be displayed in one &apos;s own window , or if all images are to always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of fil@@ ename in the browser window . if a suitable file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c ; &quot;
&quot; set up in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards cards . in three of them , gener@@ ational and editing , and slideshow , you can set the functioning of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two other , short commands for the display and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , then the pictures are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display space will be filled with the background color that you can continue down . pres@@ et@@ ting is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still view the current picture . this reduces the delay , if you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when entering the name of the last open folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen mode in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected colour . &quot;
&quot; you can set &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , that only some of the file types can be displayed , which may also represent the program . &quot;
this option will be extended to the full screen for large pictures . this option is switched as pres@@ et@@ ting .
determine whether the slideshow with the first image will start in the folder or with the selected picture .
the time span between image changes in a slideshow . to change the value you can enter a new value in the input field or the sli@@ ders or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the pres@@ et@@ ting is 3 seconds .
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions . is this value set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is broken down by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or the sli@@ ders or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the pres@@ et@@ ting is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of cards of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the cards short@@ commands for the display and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the attached view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short history .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short history .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short history .
Re@@ res@@ ized the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
magni@@ fies the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
includes the display of the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if there is no browser window opened .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first signs of the fil@@ ename you &apos;re looking for . if the file is found , it is selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ sy ; -@@ Photo@@ editing based on the &amp; checking ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; checking ; project .
show@@ casing ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is a show@@ photo event ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to his part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; photo foto ; makes it possible to report as easy as possible errors or possible improvements . wherever you use it , your browser opens up a page to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&quot; this is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , we would like to answer questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , you should know this language so powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; is it the developer mailing list to step . guide to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; &quot;
&quot; photo foto ; tries to give you so much control over your work processes as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to choose the show@@ casing settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indic@@ ators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposed indi@@ gn@@ ator was chosen , the colors should display with what you are supposed to show in contrast . under@@ exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposed colour . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . the same page bar can also be found in picture editing . you can also view this in which you click on one of the five rider &quot;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes pictures to scan and sp@@ ans .
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan images , which no longer makes pictures to scan and secluded . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save for each image a dialog to save and save the images instantly in a given folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before storing . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project by sending the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ S@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sc@@ an@@ ite ; by command sc@@ an@@ ite @-@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner is not opened or when no standard scanner was specified then a dialog to select the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . cancel it and end .
the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not treated especially .
&quot; to make a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ out and then choose Scan@@ range for the final scan . the pre @-@ check can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the picture better , the user can get into the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . it can also adjust the zoom to adjust the complete preview of the window . &quot;
if the picture has been selected then the final image can be read with the Scan button .
&quot; when before saving a preview display in the settings selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below is displayed , then the picture is stored and fold ? en leads to a down@@ fall and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the picture , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option before saving a preview display . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way you want to save them . dialog to save each image opens the dialog before any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to save it without following a fil@@ ename . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the option save without following a fil@@ ename . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as a standard for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... Change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a pre@@ fix for the automatically collected images and furthermore is the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored picture will be up@@ loaded , if a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality to save the image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Help &quot; &quot; button starts the KDE @-@ help with the &quot; &quot; App@@ an@@ l@@ ite &quot; &quot; button . the button over starts the KDE Over -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; sc@@ an@@ ite ; . the button settings will display the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sc@@ an@@ ite . &quot;

&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; use like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these cuts and its function . the global short@@ cuts can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set the short@@ cuts in the player window and set short commands ... select .
you may have to set up existing Multimedia keys that they work as &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ short commands work . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ COP interface of Am@@ aro@@ k has many general functions to be found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP function might break &amp; eg . &quot;
Am@@ aro@@ k supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Am@@ aro@@ k has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback , if the script cannot be executed due to missing dependency . please check your script whether all required modules are present and make use of dialog , so the user ID , why a script does not run . &quot;

&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts , or simply extend the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts with Am@@ aro@@ k and am@@ aro@@ k . the simplest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be attached every KDE installation .
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . this is usually used the function ex@@ ec ( ) . this way , d@@ co@@ p can be called relatively easy . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; sends noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default release and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script may ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the furnishing dialog . to save the storage and load of the furnishings , each script needs to take care of each script . if a script is started , am@@ aro@@ k will set up the desktop folder to the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;

&quot; before &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; it stops , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed to do so . for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed to the user &amp; eg ; such packages are basically normal tar archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be noted with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which allows the user to clearly recognize the archive as the Am@@ aro@@ k script . &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Exten@@ sion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages equal properly .
&quot; the main thing has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to char@@ tering modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the tar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file right : &quot;
if your script is ready you can load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and use the link to the wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; attach for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .

&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; has like most applications some options that can enable or disable for comp@@ iling time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options certain dependen@@ cies need to be filled with so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements .
&quot; enabled debu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without trouble on the furnishing dialog . the furniture dialog has several cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
&quot; player window displays the player window in addition to playlist , or out . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar was compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design @-@ filled : this function is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar was compiled . this makes the color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
tuning files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise the .@@ p@@ inch files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / m@@ ood@@ bar / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / / etc / etc / etc / / /
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browsers by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k will be started , if a browser is required . &quot;
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to a different browser which is not included in the list above .
&quot; playlist to save , save the current playlist automatically when using &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; activate this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist while exercising . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the storage location of playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is saved . &quot;
current piece of the piece change can be visible that the play@@ lists window appears - / roll rolls to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
&quot; when changing to the context of the context of the context , the context of the context is automatically changing as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the appearance of appearance you can customize &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section you can use the use of various fonts in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . you can use fonts for the following areas : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browser . click on select ... so you can select a font from the selection dialog . &quot;
with the selection of custom colour scheme you have yourself the ag@@ ony of choice and can set up a separate colour scheme . use the cut@@ out color selection for front and background color .
&quot; playback at the start , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; after program start playing the playback automatically with the piece on the spot , with which it was stopped at last time . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window on screen screen display allows you to use the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of the OS@@ D is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the cross field shadow causes the text in the OS@@ D sh@@ aded .
own colors gives you the possibility to customize the OS@@ D colors for scrip@@ ture and background . a click on the colour surface opens the dialog for color selection . if peculi@@ ar colors do not use enabled the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ sy colors are used .
the display text display shows the text shown in the OS@@ D . through the type of space hal@@ ted the OS@@ D can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of the available space @-@ holder and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to set up the OS@@ D screen on which screen .
the card audio output allows you to select a audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable further adjustment options in this card card .
the card card collection is used for setting all settings for your collection . that includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder that is to browse &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to convert a folder into the collection , select the cross field in addition to its name . this section also contains attach@@ ments to set up , like with selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folder re@@ taining and browse : this means that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will browse through music .
&quot; modifications : allows &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folder to changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , a incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import : brings that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
&quot; part of the database database is used to choose a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ations@@ feld driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , is further set up in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l . &quot;
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used for setting up the database for &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; it is entered under port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessible to which the database is made available . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ f@@ m direc@@ ts the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a load @-@ load server and create music recommendations on the current piece .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your reli@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
split pieces and update the profile : this setting allows you to send it &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters : after activation of this setting will retrieve &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; a list with similar interpre@@ ter to the relevant piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a load @-@ load profile to use this function .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Am@@ aro@@ k just needs the package K@@ delicate and otherwise no further KDE packages . you have to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs included in it ) because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; we need some of them to find ( e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some functions such as the OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome is going to work , but flu@@ x@@ box will assist for example difficulties . we try to support Am@@ aro@@ k on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ delicate and Q@@ t , because they are prepared an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably , one of your files will make an error in the day library for days . you can check the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / / / Am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the crash file . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
most of the most part is that Tag@@ lib if reading the Meta @-@ Information from this file . please report this error to the conference developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is something mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; used libraries with the same compiler version were compiled . if Z. B. &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x then this leads to overthrow the Meta @-@ Information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ obil@@ es , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or do not use any value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program writes data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a information , but not as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ 2@@ tag ; print _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print _ v@@ 2@@ tag , &quot; &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl @-@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &quot;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s icons in the status bar ( random Mode / repetition / Dynam@@ ics ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the toolbar can simply be forgotten on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol cl @-@ up error : un@@ tie icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ C@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Am@@ aro@@ k uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ W@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or remove / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf file that Am@@ aro@@ k will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify the easiest by the help of an expert your UNI@@ X@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use the forum and IR@@ C below ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the Channel # Am@@ aro@@ k .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one mistake if you &apos;re something about the recovery of an error in Am@@ aro@@ k itself .
after the start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; only a blank playlist appears . how do you get music pieces there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ up window has been converted into the Statis@@ tics window . you will find it under extras . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Am@@ aro@@ k 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist and select column . click somewhere in the new application column to set the review for a piece . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Am@@ aro@@ k is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and select from playlist to remove from the folding menu . &quot;
drag a play@@ lists file with your mouse in the playlist and let them fall there exactly how you would do it with other files . so easy is that : - )
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , you can save the button playlist . click here . &quot;
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new . take a look after lib@@ visual ; this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ al@@ isations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / X@@ ine / X@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / K@@ DE@@ mm . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and p@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be delivered in the pres@@ et@@ ting any MP3 deco@@ ders ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; when you use the link driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mix@@ er allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneous audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mix@@ ers ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa . take a look at the assistance of D@@ SA for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the problem of problem and a solution . for gon@@ dol@@ amer , you may need to specify another s@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ ine ) . &quot;
&quot; doing so &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; already . do not forget that media must first be de@@ enco@@ ded . gon@@ dol@@ amer is not easy to hear from AL@@ SA , you would only read a whi@@ p smo@@ ker . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly on AL@@ SA , just like X@@ ine . &quot;
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with highest possible priority ( real time @-@ time ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning ) see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is adjusted to :
&quot; with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause un@@ disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA furniture file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or X@@ ine , or install KDE multimedia complete to get the fastest Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ b@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the X@@ ine @-@ driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less revenue respond to visu@@ al@@ isations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C Channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Am@@ aro@@ k before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg down , compile and install it . then delete the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register . start now &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
please report it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of proposals / wishes please send them the best to our mailing list : Am@@ aro@@ k @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . also the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP it is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm execute using this command : d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k player play
&quot; this command leaves &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; play the playback . make sure that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have aroused by the soft sounds of the music that you have stopped in front of bed . &quot;
how can I find out current in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; ongoing titles if one is on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP , U@@ aro@@ k player now@@ Play@@ ing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa exists .
&quot; the visu@@ al@@ isations can be separated from &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changeable window . &quot;
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Rights mouse button is one piece in the cli@@ ck@@ ering order in the queue . by pressing the input letter after a search in the playlist the first search results will be played and the search reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ ous functions , but how does it look with the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS @-@ drive . after the start of Am@@ aro@@ k the collection database can not be created and on the console a lot of error messages can now be found .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need to drive ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; set off the CD , then click in the menu on audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . to regular read , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code you take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ F@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ LE@@ CT , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , and F@@ ROM Statis@@ tics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall outcome . &quot;
you can enter the rating for a piece yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a sp@@ al@@ box in the play@@ lists window . there you can select the evaluation of a piece right click on the piece and edit it : evaluation or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog metadata .
the developers don &apos;t want to introduce you when you are going to publish a stable version of Am@@ aro@@ k . this means : KDE packages have a fixed release plan of not connected with the short @-@ term plan of Am@@ aro@@ k .
&quot; this is a new feature in Am@@ aro@@ k , some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon in playing anim@@ ating in the general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select settings of the toolbar ... and then take the desired changes .
&quot; download a design , or create an own . install this then at Am@@ aro@@ k ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click to install new design .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to be similar . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
con@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; as you browse in the Con@@ quer@@ or browser . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . click on the button Settings ( the top ) and select Add button Add Am@@ aro@@ k ;
audi@@ os@@ cro@@ chet is a free service to be sent to the information which pieces will be played on an independent server . service is free and you only need a free username and password . audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is completely supported by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please do not use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of disp@@ ensing and thus also a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k was compiled before you have installed X@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine these output modules are not compiled . you have to configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new installed , but the output modules are still not released . and now ? &quot;
&quot; probably use a distribution , which is installed the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are required . you need to install X@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to compile and install X@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install again . &quot;
I get the mistake of G@@ Stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with p@@ rel@@ ics , which is incompatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ ay . a tip from Merlin @-@ TC : use no L@@ D@@ FLA@@ GS if you compile Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ Skype / MP4 , although the module g@@ ain@@ ti@@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play MP4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , must be installed next to g@@ lans @-@ fa@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ ic / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 stream but the module g@@ ain@@ amer mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system manager G@@ ST register . then start Am@@ aro@@ k .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Am@@ aro@@ k second sound card ?
under Settings Am@@ aro@@ k ... audio output give you the device a . typically is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ int@@ .@@ x@@ 0 { type plug @-@ k@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ ment 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug Sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the furnishing dialog of X@@ ine now us@@ b audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sub@@ str@@ ates , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual mix @-@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio edition with Arts will not be further followed . you can of course take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed super@@ visor for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the interior assistant who want to update on the first start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; if you don &apos;t like your collection to be able to update , or the assist@@ ants simply does not like , then this quick start guide can be a help . with their help you will have set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in a few minutes you will have set up . &quot;

&quot; if you want to search for entries , the spaces contain , then close the search term with go@@ ings : Mike Old@@ field . thus , after recording , Mike vintage field is included , but not after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search engine , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ th It searches for mos@@ quit@@ oes , which have a higher rating as 50 . &quot;

&quot; in this chapter we take note that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP : functions , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . then give something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; features , all &amp; k@@ de ; program measured , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two further parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; presents functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features for generating new projects . &quot;

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ instructor for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s are read and installed in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on the en@@ coder which is installed on the computer .
&amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; data stored in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many enco@@ ders that are currently supported by Linux distribution ( loss or free compression packages ) . additional co@@ ders can still be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD are recorded ; read and stored in WAV files on your computer ( loss and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format , or also in other formats such as loss @-@ free FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step you have to be installed ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ ie to ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distribution . however , it is probably not necessary to compile something itself . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not required . &quot;
&quot; which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of the audio data ; it is not possible to avoid any protected audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD ; you simply avoid buying the copy protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while inser@@ ting dialog needs to be done only once ( the furnishing dialog ) , however , can be called so often to a suitable configuration ) , is explained after the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the interface that you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which co@@ ding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a brief list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step , more information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starting the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of a request in the CD@@ DB database . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case , first the connection to the Internet must be made . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if a en@@ coder in the tab co@@ ding settings are configured in the furnishings - the co@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of the available en@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with a different en@@ coder as the default . it is to note that before the En@@ coder in the tab co@@ ding settings are configured in the furnishing dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already selected file is to be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
opens the furnishing dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programs ( like reading the &amp; CD ; completed ) . &quot;
opens the main alignment dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; using different cart@@ ons ( such as en@@ coder to customize the enco@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ding and compres@@ sive rates and helps you choose the right co . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss of free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may possibly be available for this distribution . the draw@@ backs are the small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information generated by data compressed depending on your psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still provided with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - If only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG waste devices are available .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially - support these devices mostly only MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for the audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame &apos; help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred option . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older units need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by juven@@ iles , portable devices and car oster@@ e@@ o@@ chi@@ ds . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you necessarily want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this attitude . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that are manually entered or replaced by the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ ding program to create the folder names as well as the characteristics of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of programs for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the codes explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like &quot; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in the wizard ) :
&quot; that &apos;s what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CD / enter the information , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not of the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m. of the U@@ eber@@ ger ) is not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information out , which is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; for all the information may not be added to the artist or the CD ; any information may be obtained in a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to choose a cross @-@ field ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( fake ) address as the specified in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address will not be used by the server ( This may only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use of free@@ DB is needed , the geo@@ graphically on the next flying mirror server is to be used within the network and balances the load between calcul@@ ators . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirrors for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created ) only the actu@@ aliz@@ ations of the database .
which we@@ aving program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there is rum@@ ours that this c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; whoever wants to know more exactly , looking in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; This is always to be noted that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed first if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the recovered WAV files , the enco@@ ding can be chosen and therefore the desired file format is selected . at the first opening you are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab for inser@@ tion of the code . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer @-@ package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the co@@ ding is used . this is also necessary for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers .
&quot; after installing a code , more information about his switches can be obtained through the entry of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ en@@ window ( eg ; con@@ sole ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed code . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the establishment of the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reading of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that will make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time to create everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ( tags ) .
&quot; you need to be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and can already be installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . at least , it is not necessary to compile the source files , whatever you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have scre@@ ened it ( eg by trying to copy with the Con@@ quer@@ or something inside ) .
the first section covers the fundamental set of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which is probably to be done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what has to be repeated for each selected &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ ding co@@ ding to compres@@ sing the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . because we are lazy to use the program to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with any need of a &amp; CD ; change when once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the output program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequent is / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link on the actual device designation of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD Drive is present , the effective device name can also be specified . if on the drive with other programs can also be specified , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card card General settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts can not be much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is as loaded / inserted as shown in the screenshot .
&quot; only If you select the full information , so that you will be informed if you are missing information about the creator of keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD automatically download the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected to the internet while reading the &amp; CD ; so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ ename or tag entries , it can easily be changed with the database entry and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; conference . &quot;
&quot; other than this example is further to note : if you want to manually enter all the manually , so you disable the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , these two selection fields will be chosen , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data inquiry , for the invo@@ ke of the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server about the Internet . how do the system know which data is to get to the CD ? read the section on free@@ DB . put everything as it is shown in the screenshot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet . &quot;
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and watch them for a mirror server near the computer . however this setting will function as the first try .
&quot; both work equal to the server , as though many fire@@ walls refer to the protocol 8@@ 80 default above , there is perhaps more happiness with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we don &apos;t want to submit a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should be able to disable them .
simply complete the settings of the screenshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is available on your computer )
&quot; at the same time , exc@@ ite pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time when using only an existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es reading and code ? the author does not know it , therefore simply try themselves . &quot;
CD : throw out the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are specified this cross , then the path can be specified on another drive . this can not be useful when the files are stored in a private folder . do not forget this folder when you want to make something with the WAV files itself . &quot;
&quot; all in this way , as it is in the screenshot now . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances must be something to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . this is an average of approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory . &quot;
&quot; note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the production of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) . &quot;
put the rest like in the screenshot now . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously converting WAV files : for a dual or quad@@ rup@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to code more than a WAV file at the same time .
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you don &apos;t need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD is described . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is structured on the hard disk , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB has to be described , must be repeated for each selected &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; however , the screen@@ shots do not contain a little different from the data used for a &amp; CD ; with successful from free@@ DB data for@@ ested data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD manually instead of taking it from the Internet . comments will be noted on the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &quot; special &quot; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not yet happened , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the disk , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length are listed in the window , as in the screenshot now . this only when the &amp; CD could be identified ; as an audio CD , could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD could be fet@@ ched on the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry , which you think is best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have selected the cross @-@ field for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for Settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have local database , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update title &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; the artist should no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments , the comment field of the album , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; warning : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the free@@ DB is not empty , it contains already the data as shown in the following screen photo . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor . however , it &apos;s always good idea to check the content of the CD editor or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece , and at only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . this option is set up at the tab code settings , take a look at the section &quot; &quot; settings &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see in the help to Ko@@ di@@ ers to find more information .
simply choose an entry that is obvious to the style of the selected CD ; this example is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway . for more information go to the Internet page of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under rock .
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor appears back and you see that the fields are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece into any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceeding to the same way to see all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or click the button All the pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selecting the reading process , this window appears to confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what it runs . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab for switching on the order window . it is in the upper left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is displayed just on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left part of the window in the status line .
&quot; this error message will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ ding that you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully enco@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here for example . have you checked whether you write writing to the folder for temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the start of the first piece .
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . to take out and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found any configuration adjustment to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able , the result is unclear . the used calcul@@ ator with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and co@@ ding ( from however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded , and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . respectively 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ ding of your choice . &quot;
&quot; today , S &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is now available within the &amp; k@@ d ; CV@@ S as part of the col@@ der @-@ package . if you are already included with CV@@ S . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled copy , because &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be customized to your needs when running once , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program called for many different other programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step by the options and settings to get to know . it displays screen photos of the different card maps of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still reading it ? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first time start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it is going on to go out from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of program ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual or change it , may it do . at least only after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has loaded this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you have succeeded in taking the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N then do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke Bar of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he does not have real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ real@@ ation of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players did not have . &quot;
&quot; running under &amp; Linux ; running under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ tics project drivers , which is required for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid : displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel through high@@ lighting the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ d ; every MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on cap can be drawn .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ itals or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically select the procedure used in each case .
seat support . if you stop &amp; k@@ de ; finish during playback of a song starting K@@ Mid starts again next time with the same song .
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select opening ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a music piece , open it and click the button to play in the toolbar , select the entry down from the menu piece or click the spac@@ eb@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid , a piece automatically starts , once you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid -@@ window . ( with several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played succession . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid , a piece played , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and proceed to the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click the left and right of the temp@@ o indication . to get back the original speed , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the spac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the spac@@ eb@@ ar like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu item , so breaks the playback . pressing the spac@@ eb@@ ar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the reproduction . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use li@@ ed@@ t@@ exter@@ mination and another both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type will automatically select that a song is used , so you don &apos;t have the option to change the item Automatic text . however , you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a event type , select from the menu Settings entries and rec@@ itals . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . these are used to be played in line . in this section you can use your collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs in the beginning as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the gun at the collection manager . &quot;
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leaving the application this collection is not saved . you &apos;ll be aware that if you add many pieces .
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting manager . there you can add adding a song with the button Add . it appears in turn the file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the settings automatic add to the collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece by opening ( using file opening or drag and drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , opening a piece the temporary collection will be activated and extended . this collection will then be added to the continued pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click away . &quot;
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence following the menu navigation menu , the songs are played in the sequence as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or select songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in collecting manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the button arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song inver@@ ted a song , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection manager and click the delete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this does not matter as she is leaving when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events will be translated into events that syn@@ thesizer the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the Typ@@ s Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Typ@@ s Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always let a trumpet sound , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ map because all sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( using your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that saves all required requirements for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section which may appear as often as desired . for this , however , that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D ...
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid , support for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , how the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the gender sign is ignored . it is believed that the GM patches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you must not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all sounds , which supports this instrument ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun powder . this includes the following in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if so , if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( tissues ) , it takes 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the note 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , where each sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ er instrument ( drums , Marac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one who means the sound the pitch @-@ height of the always same drum ( as does some key@@ boards possess ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how sounds are depicted on a specific channel or instrument .
&quot; as with PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section is the order of lines very important , as well as their presence . you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form sounds on the Per@@ k@@ icks canal . watch yourself as an example the provided key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to exchange some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , you simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for Key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( general MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section thus has 16 lines , numbered between 0 and 15 , assembled according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel , which is used on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ k@@ piece patch on the Per@@ k@@ chat channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ marking Ratio there are in which relation Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to be in the map file no dec@@ imal number ) .
&quot; this setting is needed because GM announces that a keyboard player has to play with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards around two tones to one oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the dialog settings . you can find this in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole row of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you can see which sounds are just played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument that is not more green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has two different views to display the played sounds . the view select Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you find example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a music piece . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . . this can result the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can force anybody to do , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB ( a compression file 4 MB ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
this can happen if you have a bin@@ är@@ distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support has been compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ) . &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before , you are sure to activate the settings automatic add to the collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection . &quot;
you can click the arrow key left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD double .
&quot; I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop , a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; when I want to play a MIDI file , or I want to play a file , only to the &amp; quer@@ or ; window changes and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn off the settings automatic add to the collection , and the new one ; file will add to temporary collection , inser@@ ting files &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. entry only do you want to play the first file . so check the settings automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then join it to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and to create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me this , further to &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; I was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the moment I wrote a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect myself a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , making music and prove sentences . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want to make a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you simply want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ k@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a great pleasure if you want to send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . before you want to send a MIDI file , but if you want to send a MIDI file , then you should contact me as I have the file already . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , and by anyone doing money for it . I would therefore like to emphasize that I only program it , because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;

&quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians in the web , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which can be found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ k@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html site . on the homepage you can find the development of information and look at pictures . there are also links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer since the sound quality is essential to your sound card . it is not the same as you use a FM device or an A@@ we card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it works as if you have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed to play video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as viewing DVD , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;

&quot; the application window is made of called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to split the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which are played by one another , so you should use the category Dau@@ gh@@ ty playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain additional hierarch@@ ies . if you choose an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the clicked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; updated pieces &apos; , TV and Dau@@ gh@@ ty playlist may also be changed through direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by application itself . simply on a name of a category is displayed just the XML content of this part . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , choose from the menu the same with playlist and select either the processing mode selected , or another category will be selected . &quot;
any changes will be lost if the processing mode left or another group is selected without using the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation at the start@@ up and finish can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ en , and amendments from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ serves option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can simply be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to enable another animation to activate . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will keep the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during start@@ up do not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening a different source . however , this would end with the end @-@ animation however , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : flooring ; called ; called : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; in@@ ted : / / / home / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / home ; are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the clip@@ board size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the edition of M@@ Player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the specific field , for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot;
&quot; in order to reproduce the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player has to be specified as a service provider for the m@@ ime type and / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the furnishing dialog file . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is used in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding charging the browser module library . the stolen process is more scar@@ p@@ player . if no error occurs , the back@@ end issue within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a given back@@ end is taken for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual chan@@ gers of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , phon@@ em@@ on will be re@@ logged in : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play by TV maps , either using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be stored , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data Re@@ order ) Settings in k@@ m@@ player is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to use . there , ports should be found out , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B included in it . &quot;
since the V@@ DR support from k@@ m@@ player only X@@ video should use X@@ video ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one working ) . for this reason the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
&quot; internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , hard @-@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ as . if they are enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there hints such as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I don &apos;t play it from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is root as user root to execute the device . it is absolutely sure to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine starts only slowly but then every time my CPU has to be tested on its performance ?

&quot; if you have any questions or when comp@@ iling from &amp; ki@@ le ; to or become an extension , this should be addressed on the mailing list of ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; D ; - environment . &amp; ki@@ le ; the possibility to use all &amp; l@@ atex ; features in a graphical surface and within this one simple , immediate and tailored tools for this . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his possibilities to learn should be the manual on K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can be there directly with reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; start .
for l@@ atex &amp; l@@ atex ; is the correct alignment : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . find the ur@@ inary &amp; tex ; difficult to use is also a La@@ ie ( engl@@ ish@@ lay ) &amp; l@@ atex ; mac@@ ros . a less challenging but real characteristic is that it originates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; given here only a good value to l@@ atex to &amp; l@@ atex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . to be able to master a guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; just as other sig@@ nat@@ ories said &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized characteristics of paper format , page numbered , and text files begins with the command \ \ Docum@@ entary class , the box starts with the command \ \ &apos; document { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ &apos; document { document } . &quot;
the rapid entry @-@ out assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a charitable function for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the assistant ( men@@ ue ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . it enables you to place some of the document related to the document .
&quot; documentary classes : hereby the type of the document follows : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ apped &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Custom . &quot;
co@@ ding : hereby the character code is set . it should use the character enco@@ ding of the system . modern systems increasingly uses the UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for the correct handling of the &amp; l@@ atex ; documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list covers the most used additional packages for l@@ atex , l@@ atex ; for the integration of them only in the cross@@ ings they are dealt with . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find the use of German texts . &quot;
new users are now not worried either . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information on this topic .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; it offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . through &amp; ki@@ le ; it is recommended to you that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is used by the modest appearance of output files . however , it is saves you by the subtle way of time and time . &quot;
with automatic filing of the environment is created by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ &apos; s { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line of the command ( e.g. \ \ \ &apos; command } ) . this function can be disabled in general settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands de@@ activated .
&quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; em@@ powering the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most popular and subtle element ) : &quot;
&quot; in view of the document in the struc@@ turing view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; once a DVI , file was created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer for the appropriate line in the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contained a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as font , or l@@ atex ; or l@@ atex ; there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and folders . &quot;
when using the search results are the elements of DVI ; file associated with the editor and once upon an element in the DVI ; the source code is embro@@ i@@ dered is the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in the &amp; l@@ atex ; the source code is clicked on the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer .
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master @-@ document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . in the use of a project a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted to project settings .
quick building : the &amp; l@@ atex ; code text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless no errors in the source code ) .
file @-@ growing : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file at trans@@ der@@ og@@ â s has been interpreted and there is no call of &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after fast construction .
&quot; in case of viewing the editing toolbar , the three large number of elements should be developed into the document . the first selection field is for quick installation of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ sible &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division were : &quot;
&quot; the selection field is for example of items such as tags , fu@@ eling notes or references . the following options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a description for a section , an image or other element is created . &quot;
cover : is used for the reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection box ) .
&quot; when using quote will display a selection list with liter@@ ary deposits . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be made available in &amp; ki@@ b@@ tex ; and files can be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection box with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¢ teau is used for setting the fonts . it can be specified for the main text , the fu@@ eling notes , etc . there are the following fonts . &quot;
&quot; at the call of &amp; ki@@ le ; there are two selection of options available : 1 . the wizard for the creation of a new document by selecting the document , and pre@@ determined settings . 2 . the document can be written on hand by hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ Docum@@ entary class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays the writing process . if the writing is not at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
once the above source code example has to be entered the &amp; l@@ atex ; swelling text has to be compiled . the simplest way to this is the use of the menu building or the button quick@@ ening .
the source code must be saved before the comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; for the storage automatically .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document mis@@ ses , should be sought after errors in the logging of errors . if using fast @-@ installation , &amp; Ok@@ ular ; this is not the case , it should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ ish@@ y environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest document . for example , a report with the font will have been created 12 and just a few lines . the command \ \ &apos; environment } , \ \ &apos; and \ \ end { environment } . &quot;
&quot; the symptoms are only used within the surroundings ( of \ \ \ \ &apos; environment } to \ \ &apos; { environment } ) . there are no accus@@ ation within a environment . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities to brigh@@ ten the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . it can be added for example certain fonts , li@@ posu@@ ction , cur@@ riculum , sub@@ sist@@ ence , etc . these commands either end with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
&quot; \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } : this command is for the short expression and is as long as he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be represented by \ \ \ &apos; Word } cur@@ ly . &quot;
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ &apos; { rate } and ends with \ \ &apos; quot@@ as } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ label , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; once the wizard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . for this , there should be a few positions in the li@@ posu@@ ction and cur@@ siveness and a poem to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and spa@@ wn . &quot;
DVI ; is an indispensable file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screen watching . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed by file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correctly adjusted ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar searches the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI , file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; the source code was created , the conversion can be used in us@@ hed other formats by means of the kno@@ ck in the toolbar . &quot;
the scroll search through the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ binary files . for this purpose only Modern under Settings box has to set up ... tools building sets .
&quot; to rep@@ el the pre @-@ search results , the mouse @-@ cursor is positioned in a row of source code and contra@@ sting it on board search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then made . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; document from &amp; ki@@ le ; to be specified and set to the corresponding line ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; as Tex@@ ts@@ di@@ tor are set up ( settings Ok@@ ular ... Editor )
&quot; should the use of fast @-@ construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewer does not cause an error . should an error occur , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window summary . &quot;
&quot; the log file ent@@ ails the source of error in the source code . in the editor you can always consider the previous La@@ Te@@ X error messages and N@@ Ã ¤ r@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors , in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , must be attached to the error in the logging site , and jump to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once upon the appropriate button in the toolbar panel , a window will appear to select the template for the document . &quot;
&quot; when selecting a more empty document , a document can be used either from scratch or the wizard will be used for quick creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; voluntary users of &amp; l@@ atex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates enables you to place , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file ge@@ net or a new file will be created . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and select from a file template ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a file , some strings can be replaced by other data ( such as name or string enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings box ... Settings can be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIO@@ NS $ $ : this string is used by entering documentation class . typically , it is used as well as docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIO@@ NS $ $ &#93; { item } . &quot;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants and thus the following steps in the editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps has been accomplished :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be used instead of the default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one on the internet and which were carried out under the described steps . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor of many different types of text ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . a lot of settings are done directly out &amp; ki@@ le ; can be made out .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his answers should be experienced , the manual on K@@ ate will be her@@ ed . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offer a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; instruction reference , which can be called on the menu &apos;s help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it gives an exhaustive description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; double @-@ clicking with penet@@ rated string , to compens@@ ate to the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way at clicking \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; in the end of the text with the left mouse button , the text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , it can be used to choose parts of the source code in the Edi@@ tor@@ window . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the ability to browse the most different types of source texts and to particular note it . for example the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
&quot; many assist@@ ants can choose your own jumping marks . this is one of its own kind of book@@ marks within the text . also , this jumping brand is highlighted so that they will automatically detect on the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already added many environments and groups , and therefore , are used for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands for their selection . under edit , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; set a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which contain a blank lines on both sides ( as in other text t@@ dit@@ ors ) . this extended meaning do not include a text with transparent lines , &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of source code . this extended thing is divided by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an advanced meaning , since this command also has an extended meaning as this command is also &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands with an additional star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; as part of a part of the document it can be removed from that first , and by drama the key is removed . &amp; K@@ ate ; offer the whole line . &amp; ki@@ le ; it provides with its own commands to include a faster result . under Edit remove , the following commands are included in the text : &quot;
&quot; remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit excerpts , paragraph . &quot;
&quot; it has already been illustrated that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore , &amp; N@@ F provides additional commands from editing environment for easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ; &quot;
&quot; with this command , to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to exit the area . &quot;
with this command to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the area .
&quot; if the cursor is located in front of or within the command \ \ &apos; of { area } , to the end of the surroundings ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many con@@ vol@@ ati@@ fied environments , the order can quickly be lost . this command vo@@ iced the most recently taken place , so that the conce@@ aled ambient structure will not destroy . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups which are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands to suit those from machining .
this command is inj@@ ected to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the angular cl@@ amp .
with this command line becomes the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the angular cl@@ amp .
if the cursor is before or behind the curved cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many c@@ ach@@ ed groups @-@ br@@ aces , the user @-@ br@@ aces can quickly be lost . this command vo@@ iced the most recently taken place , so that the ri@@ pped structure of the &amp; tex ; groups did not destroy . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; l@@ atex ; two simple initial implementation is used as a grid . for the beginning of the beginning , the sign &quot; is used . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this automatic set @-@ up of double penetration can be set under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X , and can be re@@ trac@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; it can also be used with specific settings ( such as n@@ or French ) , and thus German or French origin . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; at the opposite of Shift ; entrance , &amp; ki@@ le ; an intelligent line set . if the current position is within a list of lists ( such as enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a table area , you &apos;ll close &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with a slept break off . &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ pres@@ et &amp; l@@ atex ; - or Custom environments . these can be added to settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X are added .
&quot; some users want to assign the columns in tables and thereby all the em@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . although this tab@@ ulator is not the associated line , for the columns , the columns and the current Tab@@ ulator . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already offering a good source code , this in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for example &amp; l@@ atex ; ) are still extended . all of these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings box ... wiring . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ &apos; { area } , &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ &apos; { setting } following an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when the bar is removed , the last letter of the input is removed and therefore , the list is possible by entering another letter also . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . the descriptions are more natural to choose from a command . alternatively , you can choose to have a jump to these positions using edit jumping marks N@@ Ã ¤ est jumping brand and then the desired parameters can then be found . &quot;
&quot; settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; nest@@ ing settings to these lists are to be made . it can be used different W@@ ays for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands , as well as laundry , common language used . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is for the processing of environments not required . however , there is always a few letters with \ \ &apos; entered and the call of complete mode is used , the environments are so often used that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the sealing of the environments . &quot;
&quot; when you call the complete change mode , the menu button , or the ke@@ eper of Alt + Shift key blank is the order will be continued automatically and it appears \ \ &apos; . after that , the ambient exercise can be continued by simple way and can be terminated by the input of the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is accomplished , the environment is automatically shut down again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognize that it is a lists environment , it will even be a first \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; nest@@ ing settings to these lists are used . this mode uses the list of complete mode for operating mode , and l@@ atex ; - and l@@ atex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; support user @-@ defined lists of mix@@ ers to be replaced instantly . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... and the lists are available for ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word negoti@@ able mode for example , the letter L has been replaced by string + Alt spaces , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ allies are not helpful for automatic contrac@@ tually . however , it has been noted that many miracles are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; ki@@ le ; the subsi@@ dy for all already written confirmation . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu boxes ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ ful@@ stÃ ¤ n@@ ering , which can also be determined by the swelling of the attachment . &quot;
&quot; the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / mode / mode / / pers@@ ist home folder , or tex . &quot;
the dialog graphics are designed for setting graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the basics of the graphics formats the sections should be observed and observed .
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for use and re @-@ extrac@@ tions of pages . will the PDF issue be arranged , so you can be converted into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are grouped in the draft to create comp@@ iling , creation and creation . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source of the viewer like &amp; Ok@@ ular ; or the further conversion can be used to the key@@ note viewer by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; to be converted into a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the instruction manual , normally a viewer is called after comp@@ iling . should not be used any in@@ und@@ ener observer , every time a new window will be used . &quot;
a new project will be the project &apos;s new project .... here you will find the following information about the project :
&quot; when selecting the fil@@ ename window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
&quot; the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; permits the exec@@ uting of EC@@ MA@@ Script Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in vertically bar . &quot;
&quot; the API scripts are not yet developed , and can still be available in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le . &quot;
first must be said that the exec@@ uting environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ti@@ le ) has the following methods :
&quot; l@@ atex ; is a quite small system , which can be expanded with a wide range of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aid to support the user . &quot;
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the contained packages and a further &amp; l@@ atex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; a fully inde@@ xed traine@@ e for &amp; tex ; and he that is called &quot; &quot; Fre@@ un@@ de@@ â &quot; . &quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for the search for a specific form@@ atting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; Tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; shipped , finding the right document is not always easy . as a regular help , the small application of textile straps provided , which contains a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; supplied documents and provided a graphical surface . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories and the beneficial advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or head@@ lines . by &amp; ki@@ le , just the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space of the space used the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ ist and user @-@ friendly &amp; l@@ atex ; - / tex ; source code , which can be found on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix systems ; is also a part of the Fink project , rendering &amp; ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X @-@ X . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who are looking after the continuance of the &amp; ki@@ le ; - project aims and d@@ af@@ ar for many hours for the development of tools sacrific@@ ing , which we are all interested in considering the &amp; GNU : license . &quot;

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphic editor to manage many different sig@@ natures for e @-@ mails . the sig@@ natures only create random sig@@ natures or daily sig@@ natures from a list . this command line interface provides the sig@@ natures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ;
&quot; for random sig@@ natures , any signature is read from the sign@@ alling file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read through many sig@@ natures with different quotes , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily nature , the same signature is created for all day the same signature from the sign@@ alling file of &amp; k@@ sig ; for each day you use different sig@@ natures , as with the random sig@@ natures create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you one lt ; blank sig@@ natures ; and insert your signature in the bottom row ; and insert your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click the flo@@ ppy icon . &quot;
&quot; you can create any number of sig@@ natures . then you have a list of sig@@ natures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use e @-@ mails private or professionally , there are always sufficient sig@@ natures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it in the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross in the toolbar . &quot;

&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in its integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; these tools are unique in its integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; all these tools are used as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination results fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has worked , I mean pro@@ c and how over@@ ra@@ vel it is . let &apos;s rely on a graphical surface ! not more on a terminal , simply clicked on the icon for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects an inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ et@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ et@@ book is located in the selected work@@ station . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time when said pro@@ c .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then they simply leave the current folder folder . if not , then select current working folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is incorrect . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the previous file has already been marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , then they let the current file simply go @-@ go . if not , delete them from current file the tick , and select the file to be checked by means of other file sel@@ ector . &quot;
if they only want to know if the well @-@ being is well @-@ made please click the Well @-@ mail review selection .
&quot; to use a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; , which is specified in the &amp; XML ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the place of the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise , and for the Relax@@ NG review is the indication of the definition @-@ UR@@ I ; in the file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; also has one &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; already , then they let the current file be selected simply . if not , remove the selection of the file and select the file to be processed by using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; type the name of the file , as the result is to be named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; even perhaps little to do . this becomes the plug @-@ system very powerful . therefore , the plug @-@ ins can be used immediately until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI . more about that . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we begin editing with the Edit Edit menu . this is why the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all the contained plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search ad . in adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; this path to search the plug @-@ ins .
&quot; often , working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ le@@ en ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project @-@ Properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves as a clear identification .
one member can have multiple roles in the project like a team leader as well as sub@@ project manager .
the user can opt out from the list of team members who is . this happens when he is looking out the team member from the list and the button is pressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) will be made using : text .
nick@@ name and setting up your own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for further information on remarks .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team manager when something is happening . see in for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are carried out when something specific in the project is done . an example would mark the recording of open and locker of the project so that later , a file would be saved , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script that is added to the project , as soon as it is added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; on the side event configuration of the Shift , F@@ 7 project project settings di@@ alo@@ ges can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an e @-@ mail is sent to the addres@@ see list of the addres@@ see list of the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project manager . see in accordance with such a ladder .
remarks are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes is simple . it can be chosen either by note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment area followed by default text .
&quot; notes can be sent for a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax of the first image leader ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nick@@ name of the recorded nick@@ name of the team member should be introduced , as stated in the following examples , as shown in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ name and reels names are independent of large or small @-@ sp@@ elling , but spaces around the br@@ aces and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a development environment for script and form@@ atting languages , which is D@@ T@@ D @-@ agn@@ os@@ tically and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; specific settings are dealt with , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by means of Settings Qu@@ anta R@@ anta . diesel dialog extends over a few pages that are dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / inf@@ elling of tags : large / inf@@ lic@@ ing of automatically wrapped tags . normal Groß / mini@@ ature means the tags will be added as they are described in the day XML files .
large / inf@@ lic@@ able of attributes : large / inf@@ lic@@ ants of automatically covered attributes . normal Groß / mini@@ ature means the attributes are as inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
&quot; optional tags automatically connect : if attached , is optional for tags , for which the end day is optional , this immediately after the bed . &quot;
not optional tags automatically shut : as above for all other tags except for the simple tags .
Start@@ - and conclusion @-@ day automatically update : when switched on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate co@@ ding during filing .
M@@ IM@@ E types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s for detection of different types of files . using the default standard the standard templates can be restored .
standard string enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening open files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be over@@ looked ) but this setting will be loaded from the same into the project Properties in case a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D is not recognized . but this setting will be broadcast by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; created regular backup copies , so that at a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . also for even not stored documents a backup regularly , according to the time @-@ issued time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard boxes ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings to the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface through changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the War@@ n@@ esday section serves the tax of the possibility to dis@@ continue the display of war@@ nings by adequ@@ acy of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts as well as the sync behavior of the V@@ PL@@ E and the source code in its shared mode .
&quot; here the Par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse @-@ click on the struc@@ turing , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the struc@@ turing tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the field of struc@@ turing attitudes , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be opened at machining and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . blank no@@ des are the empty areas in the text while blank groups are such that no item has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area for the fixing of abbreviations ( a type of templates ) which are un@@ folded to the editing of large text . abbreviations are valid in groups , each may be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it may be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ ool ac@@ ron@@ ym is something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plugins are managed to be managed . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third @-@ related application , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part application , most known and con@@ quer@@ or ; . by inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard location such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin to start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
component in the &quot; Just @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode download : check if the plugin denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to load the store if this option is not chosen .
&quot; check the plugin : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; whether the entered information is correct , even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from version 3.3 , the debu@@ gger was set completely new . Di@@ e@@ Support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger was set , as well as the support for the db@@ g debu@@ gger . instead , a debu@@ gger @-@ Plugin concept was implemented , which allows various implem@@ ent@@ ations of plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ire . &quot;
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . using the Options dialog next to the debu@@ gger plugin you can change the specific settings .
&quot; when a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort : user interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of supervised variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view , in which all semi @-@ points , with pointer numbers and conditions are listed . appears normally in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is usually displayed in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to debu@@ gger , if necessary , or she shares the plugin with , based on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ v . this action is opened by default if a project is opened , so it should not be respected in the normal case . &quot;
the counter@@ part to debu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or end the sounds to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the debu@@ gger edition .
&quot; indicates the debu@@ gger , begin with the execution of the script and to send information about the surveillance variables , as well as the currently exec@@ uting current line . when this happens when the script is continued , the execution is continued , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; re@@ jects the debu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to send out , without information on monitoring variables and the current line number . when this happens when a script has been announced , the execution starts , as soon as a requirement is asked . &quot;
the debu@@ gger leads the next instruction on the script without responding to the functions or include Inclu@@ des .
&quot; the debu@@ gger leads the next instruction on the script , whereby if possible in functions and include @-@ in error . &quot;
&quot; points the debu@@ gger to move the directive and go to the next one , as if there were the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the surveillance value appears in the variable view . &quot;
this dialog can be inserted a variable or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of K@@ eit@@ h Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ d ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that can be found on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of K@@ eit@@ h .
&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ h ; to suit your needs , and how you can get &amp; squee@@ zing ; help , better to become better . &quot;
&quot; type of document editions ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril ; used to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages , as well as &amp; CSS . ability to make sure your simplicity and flexibility makes coming &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script and the toolbar . tag folder contain two types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folder are handy to insert images and instructions faster in a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see in for details on the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create equ@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also Organ@@ izer . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; day XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the owner , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for the tag allows a fast inser@@ tion of tags into a document without a risk of a writing . &quot;
&quot; tag folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the day @-@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html 4.@@ 01 @-@ ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the equ@@ XML to and de@@ kl@@ ed whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations will be explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a day XML document . it can only contain once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains nothing else than nothing else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
only for the day type are valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for the Type Meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a File@@ attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . that is only one element type item .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tags . this item can only be described once for any attribute . it sets the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags which will describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc . this is an only element item . &quot;
are the source used for filling the source texts for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute @-@ tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; is used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; is used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments that are transferred to the method . may be empty or % a day name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container @-@ day covers the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute description only once . it is an only element type item .
att@@ aches the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialog . this day can only occur for any attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the item is empty .
&quot; returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty . &quot;
returns a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this item is only one element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this item is an only element type .
all day XML files need to begin with a &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything but watch on &amp; and lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; to be replaced . this will not cause a break @-@ off , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the equ@@ XML files , the tools can start up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available yet . at the present , the verification only occurs when loading the equ@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; and XML ; -@@ pattern . the fil@@ ename for this day XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; following an example of a working family 2 day XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; Over@@ charge function is described . the fil@@ ename of this day XML file is to be over@@ loaded .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor to be accessible via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings ; for one from a list sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it should be created for a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; it should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can set with settings actions ... created . click New action leads to the same dialog :
this action @-@ weigh@@ ted short@@ cuts . with clicking the button user defined can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; using K@@ one is the current short@@ cuts .
the simplest action . it can be inserted a text in the det@@ ective settings and inserted in execution of action this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful shareholder type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; even the quick start @-@ up dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / My@@ Script . sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting you variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta / Scrip@@ anta /
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; only one instance runs , the text is added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP are used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; it is used by external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
in addition to the above mentioned methods can take a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; at the default entry you can be determined to send out what is to be sent to default . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this attitude .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the printed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : normal edition , to the default error messages ; error messages can be specified to the default error messages ; it may be specified using the default output specified by the default output output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the market @-@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in any case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the brand . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar is added , you need to add and configure promotions . choose settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add them to the fitting tool .
&quot; complete all and if the day attribute has and you plan their use , enable you to edit dialog &quot; day , &quot; if available , so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . choose from the &amp; menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; in view that the day start , I decided to create a starting kno@@ b as a symbol . through the use of green ( green , mostly interpreted as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user are sign@@ aled that An@@ des this symbol will insert one &amp; lt ; launch a day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it must be associated with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; ) and selection of the desired action . besides the text field is a button , press him . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the use button and continue with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ups and it should be shared a better overview of several separ@@ ators in several groups . open the toolbar setup dialog via settings toolbar . make sure that the desired toolbar can be selected .
&quot; I want to choose the separ@@ ators ( very left up ) for my work toolbar . after selecting the item , which is to be added to the toolbar icon , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to preview a fast way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; please be aware of how the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my work toolbar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ but@@ t . &quot;
the new toolbar must be tested through promp@@ ting all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; backup in the correct folder . after New@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be saved im@@ part folder , but your work toolbar ( n ) should be loaded in the right folder ( n ) , if a file is opened by the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; maybe the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language , which you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ Re@@ pository , whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for form@@ atting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second treat us here . &quot;
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the docum@@ ent@@ ations HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # 2 , version 2 , day 2 , day 2 , day 2 , day 2 , day 2 , day 2 = and 2@@ html 2 = days 2.@@ html Day 2 = day 3.@@ html &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation something :
&quot; # KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 , = Table of Cont@@ ents , # 8@@ x.@@ html Table of Cont@@ ents , ... Sign@@ x.@@ html = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html &quot;
note the # before the start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for chess training . but try it yourself .
you note that the index directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ent at the top end of the construction @-@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; D . signs . these should be replaced by a amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; resources files will be replaced . &quot;
&quot; this section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended to display the context of context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; H for context help , the documentation would be shown directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file @-@ binding . &quot;
a simple list of con@@ den@@ sed context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
&quot; now you can save your file d@@ cr@@ c , and after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that this good and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best Web@@ developer platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ators ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else . at different places there is an Email menu entry with email , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts . &quot;
&quot; resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ le@@ en ; users can download it . the contributions are checked and only available if our team needs them as correct and useless for publication . so , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the subsequent users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will ask for their passion for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys you may need to look out . in the dialog New resource , the input fields must be filled ( URL Pre@@ view can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installing , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the integrity of the resource by checking of integrity and Sig@@ ni@@ cation . in case of problems it is war@@ ns and it can then be broken . please note the warning messages and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; however , the creation may be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day @-@ files in day XML format might be necessary . there is the easier way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ T@@ D loading and Convert a D@@ T@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D @-@ description , which is to be used . after that , the following dialog will appear : &quot;
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ e@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition command : the string ending in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
&quot; D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; according to conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , there are some key concepts . to understand these and to get full benefit of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril , so one must first famili@@ arize themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter seeks to bring them precisely these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local , and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ le@@ en ; uses , available . from tool @-@ bla@@ sts on actions is all that is globally marked , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; saved . this enables the group of administrators to secure different materials , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available each in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are custom patterns and toolbar . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to materials with special promotions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are illustrated in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powering the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; MDI ; consists of several main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ pane , the construction insights , the cart@@ els with information and the toolbar . please suggest in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cardboard boxes with the right mouse button to load a context menu with the current document templates , to restart , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right in the Edi@@ tor@@ area lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , processing of under the mouse pointer or opening the file , when the string is referred to under the mouse pointer to a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the toolbar icons ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool @-@ bla@@ zing is shown . in the course of the further expansion of material indicators , the toolbar can be adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of the toolbar is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click the icon that represents the day . now , they can insert the data for this just added day . if you want to insert the data for this just added day ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate to the information of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to navigate , to open and expand . in the presentation with cart@@ ons are available for files , project , sample @-@ structure , scripts , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; prepared this view all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as adding , removal , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from memory medium can be performed with the indicated context menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category is always available , local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more on templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the right mouse button you can access the available information on a script . the right mouse button is available for further functions , such as the script to start , edit or send e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ click of an element , the cursor is set to the position of the element . through the right @-@ click of an element a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
this tree appears under the other buildings . with it can manage man@@ quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . this is possible to change the content of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul has achieved two cardboard tra@@ ys at the bottom of the window , which can be reached via usability information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this card driver shows information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . such as the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D are displayed .
&quot; this card driver shows all the errors in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; scripts , which are executed , do all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the be@@ zel are extensive and easy to understand and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and you get the appropriate command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the opportunity to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is the ability to send a toolbar with e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; send the toolbar in an email , then they can backup them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ h ; as any other can backup and load ! &quot;
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ h ; files on your system have to be enabled . to provide a complete list of options that can be transferred to the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and here are not executed .
&quot; if you have problems at the start@@ up of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , you should check if your path does the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PA@@ TH before their bin folder . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor began creating the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; an independent , exten@@ dable market @-@ up languages would be ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; now , is far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . I can then define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim has to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; as a product based on outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based , in good use of free software , the idea of Why develop ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ rum@@ or is not only all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . by using the program , they can only notice them &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort . ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been developed for a fast web development , and has quickly expanded to an out@@ dated editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details of the documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; contra@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ help@@ desk help : / qu@@ anta perform ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and served by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick @-@ hand list of files you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file that is not placed on it where the oldest entry is taken .
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check out the section about templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ condition , only a bug will be reported . &quot;
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there a special character to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ submission so that it appears correctly and not be understood by the browser as form@@ atting assignment .
conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; note that the correct way to inser@@ ting special signs and spaces in the URL ; s is used primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor day .
&quot; select the block selection or from . this allows you to choose text files with the help of the &amp; Shift . &quot;
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages can be released !
searches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and debu@@ gger .
&quot; initial and intim@@ id@@ ation of the problem @-@ por@@ ters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated , once you change to the structure tree . &quot;
displays the toolbar button on the left side of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with one mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or next , depending on the cursor position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the fil@@ ename of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory to new files that could be there . that allows e.g. graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folders and then add it to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the project managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril , you will find the details . &quot;
invites a project tools . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only allowed in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to store your work toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by means of settings . tools are stored by means of tool @-@ bla@@ zing materials . you will need to save the toolbar on the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; removed a toolbar from the field of view . that does not del@@ etes it from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you will ask if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; with this , you can send their own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; team , so that the toolbar can be present in the next publication ) . the menu item will open a new e @-@ mail message with the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows up@@ loading of tools on the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;
&quot; load a &amp; D@@ T@@ D , who has made you or anyone else and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; own cap@@ turing format . &quot;
&quot; load / refresh of the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is useful when the entities of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew , if this global and a des@@ ks in the global KDE folder is not present , fails to load the store . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded materials . if the standard ( HTML ) toolbar can be loaded in the tags menu a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current date dialog dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activated or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . it only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . it does not work with tool @-@ toolbar if this day contradic@@ ts the rules on this place . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed beneath the menu items listed above . click on them . click on a activated plug @-@ ins disabled . &quot;
choose the syn@@ tac@@ tical mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ ding schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version starting .
&quot; choose the type of line identifi@@ er . very useful if you know people , the other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; by means of the external application tidy .
immediate switch between the different types of UI . due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries the switching can sometimes need or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the default setting mode which is also the default setting mode that the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; 3.2 and earlier corresponds .
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for every open sub@@ window . with selecting an entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
turn the status of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; main window or out .
&quot; the changes in this dialog are influ@@ encing any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editing window . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
a dialog will appear in which you delete entries from the toolbar or which can change the or@@ der@@ line .
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor , but it is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project , the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril ; development in financial form you can find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed and completed from top to bottom , as after the filling of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics can be adjusted later . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering your name , file will be automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , on which you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemp@@ .de ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; leaves this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used . depending on the setting of the remote computer might be an adjustment necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the toolbar for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standards . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system to the project . it can be selected several files or whole folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have st@@ atic web content you want to download and change . in case of server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started on new , not p@@ aken . &quot;
this option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an exact selection of th@@ inning .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by means of hook or , by removing the tick , chambers from the project . &quot;
the final screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with project properties in the bottom window profile or with the short@@ cuts Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) which can be newly ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; supplementary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded at opening the project . in addition , more about project views can be read . &quot;
with this you can choose the desired debu@@ gger . currently only Gub@@ ed supports . more information about Gub@@ ed you can find in . the debu@@ gger @-@ Plugin can be set with the Options button . in case the debu@@ gger option is described .
&quot; in the sub@@ window profile , up@@ loading profiles can be adjusted ( see in ) , as well as the display of a supervision for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing a separate construction @-@ view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration , one can turn off event actions and add these actions , modify or delete these actions , if a previously defined event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not currently be influenced . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project open ... from the menu project or symbol project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows you to choose a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; closed , the project file will automatically be saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . you can manage the files in the current project .
&quot; folders are as well , however the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right mouse button click menu : &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loading files . see .
&quot; enables removing the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button is dro@@ pping to prevent removing . &quot;
the password is kept in the core memory and remember with Program@@ mes . this possibility is useful when most frequent up@@ loading files are needed and the rather in@@ secure password on the record Save option does not appear in question .
this will stop transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , many high @-@ la@@ ding profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded on different servers . when editing or creating a profile this dialog is displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied , either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address . &quot;
&quot; the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sla@@ ves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP , file ( locally ) and NFS . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . usually , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate any service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your att@@ acking , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so that it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can be easily seen in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and toolbar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. through simple exchange view , various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbar . &quot;
views can be stored or deleted in the menu project or the project toolbar can be opened or deleted by Settings .
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort , with which one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ le@@ en ; to its own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are toil@@ ers in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; best about the menu of the toolbar . usage and adding can be distinguished . the addition of the toolbar will be dealt with in the section Add of the toolbar .
&quot; the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the toolbar , a new toolbar can be implemented , which can be specified in dialogue where you may be specified , which actions on this or other toolbar can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , will additionally remove the entries &apos; s &apos; records and this action worked out that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar ... and settings set may be set .
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ eton , code cut@@ lets and files to the short@@ cut . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; used in principle as a commonly used file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or each in the system available in the pres@@ et tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; in about the limitations that one can imagine for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; supplied templates will have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set out before using exactly .
&quot; Bin@@ är is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted every file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; binary templates will usually be inserted in documents with link@@ ages ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found under global templates . more information about the Templates tree is available . &quot;
documents can be created by any text type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . normally a simple rum@@ ours for the purpose and organizing the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ deposit below global templates . see for more information about the templates tree .
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template , but the same text area is always included in the documents . some examples are found in the pre@@ condition below global templates . see in for more information about the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a folder structure , folded in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; shape a documentation structure according to Beli@@ ar ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File As a template Save as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project pre @-@ situation ) the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the pre @-@ scale tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As a template , save a selection of a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be drawn with pulling and dra@@ gging to the designs . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only stored in a subur@@ b folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as pulling or inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting over the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can select a folder in the file tree or in the project files to create a folder on the right and backup site template , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynamically connect with &amp; PHP ; in addition one can keep some things in touch with templates in projects very deep .
the pre @-@ dimensional structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates /
&quot; in order to set the behavior of a folder , click the folder overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialog will appear : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is completed , as soon as el@@ ong@@ ated attributes exp@@ ires . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the regul@@ ators in the pre@@ condition overview . if a regular folder would be set out , unless they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder would seem to appear . in case of a normal folder would appear . if nothing appears , one probably is in a regular folder . &quot;
allows list or displayed text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p up a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( to indicate the right mouse button ) via a complete command line for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor , which can be accessed via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source editor into two parts : the source Editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; Editor uses as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor . then you can edit and switch to the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code are visible . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly as the first , except that at the same time the changes are activated both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor , this mode is already active , the button will shift the active cursor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document will be retained . &quot;
the synchronization of synchron@@ isation between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta .... After selection of V@@ PL ; - View can additionally be configured between synchron@@ isation by one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation is to be adjusted for fast computer and a large amount of space for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so you want to select the title of the website . this document is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is possible . this is intended to change the tran@@ scription of the suspension . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags permit the storage of information about the document e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons , e.g. keywords on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete a change through the met@@ a elements . the processing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to incorporate an external CSS @-@ style system by pressing the file button , and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the cursor is like in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . the marker works as usual . text can be inserted by type and can be deleted by user @-@ key or removal . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags will be made in the same way on the toolbar , as in the source code editor . it is to note that the inser@@ tion of tags already existing identical tags , e.g. if an anchor day , surrounded with text , each other surrounding anchor will be removed . &quot;
some materials such as the tables wizard or the lists assistant are disabled . they are later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists of the toolbar must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examination of style templates . in contrast to other programs for styles the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style can be trac@@ ed .
&quot; to be able to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile out , need out &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ zed s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already available in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ isons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made a lot of changes and at the same time had corrected the re@@ payment at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during the merger .
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps just the back@@ wards had changed . the collapse of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 was able to display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful features were added .
&quot; for example , if you would like to compare text quickly , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the compar@@ ision window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ use , almost in a complete file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way connection will be fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently in one piece of co@@ de and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve any changes . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the outcome . the screenshot showing three qu@@ ell files at the same time :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and together complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when you create a folder :
&amp; diff@@ use 3 ; shows the exact differences and control the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you have to check Ko@@ de you will like to check this feature .
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are shown visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no anger more , if someone change the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can easily write the typ@@ o by simply writing the fil@@ ename of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 folder diff@@ use 3 folder @-@ 3 folder folders and diff@@ use 3 folder 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 folder folders
&quot; opening @-@ dialog allows the manual type of fil@@ ename , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting an finally opened file from the listing list . opening your selection and displays it next time . you do not need to specify third file ; when you have the entry for C to be empty , the analysis of differences with two files is carried out . &quot;
&quot; using the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders will be selected , then uses a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when inter@@ connecting is inter@@ woven , the input field is active for the goal and can handle itself . however , it is not necessarily required to define immediately an output file . you can get this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens up a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / collapse .
&quot; sometimes one does not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparative window . the comparison starts then immediately . in opening dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button . &quot;
you can also drag and drop pulling out : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains such a similar effort . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would just be a relatively large amount of effort . you would need to upload two appropriate files , paste it into &amp; diff@@ use . now you can simply copy the relevant sections simply , paste and then compare . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case @-@ leaving text into a comparative window is supported . &quot;
&quot; warning : several editors interpret the pulling and inser@@ tion of text into another program as alignment and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each word window , the Info @-@ line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Each info section has a different color . ( if the path to a file is long , leave the mouse over the line . then a small Help window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three spring windows are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre @-@ settings can be changed across the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees in the colour , which file is different . if both files differ in red . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the colour scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is easy to see in the next section ( interplay ) . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is found the summ@@ aries . when differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . with some programming languages the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , relevant for Pre@@ processor and in few , rare items . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the abstr@@ acts column of text , is interrupted by the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the case @-@ enum@@ eration is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparative issue ) also has a info @-@ line with the wording of the file name : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; changed &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it includes the automatic comp@@ utation already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved is the saving de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ sters are used , every difference is at the same time a conflict that has to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the first row of the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ) This group will then be shown the current group . ) This group will then be shown with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam . &quot;
&quot; sometimes the automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing does not have any other line left in the group ; there is only one space for the case , that you may change your mind and perhaps return another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker you might want to copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
the text &amp; lt ; composition fli@@ gt ; however appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
&quot; note : if you choose the options to ignore the options numbers or add Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; this navig@@ ates mainly with images and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can also use the arrow keys left , top , end , stra@@ g @-@ beginning and string , can also be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the end window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ ting button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ load mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the abstr@@ acts columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows on the top of each group ( as already explained in the section ) and the edi@@ table editing window has been explained .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( roadmap down@@ wards / stra@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( string @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , you have to solve conflict between sol@@ der and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ inser@@ tion ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically transferred to the clip@@ board and copy the manual copy . be careful with this option but you might acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; zinc variants are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants are using a line @-@ box character \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use wagon + z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ ie \ \ r \ r . K@@ diff@@ 3 does not use the block of source files , therefore you ought to use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the recently used files will be automatically saved when you start automatically and start the next start . ( menu att@@ un@@ used - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog places also fonts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ si@@ ver script are shown . if the chosen script does not support this representation does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be visu@@ alised . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically set an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , the loading of the Tab@@ ulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the entry or return , the incoming line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied into the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which type @-@ end type you prefer for storing . the advanced value is the generally usual selection of the operating system .
&quot; while comparing files are temp@@ ted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in source files can be ignored . the second step is compar@@ es each line . in this step white signs are not ignored . also , white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a car back &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; and a second @-@ box &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others in turn , you may differ slightly . if this option is activated , the car fli@@ ckers are visible , however , like a whi@@ tish sign , this option has to be disabled . in the pres@@ et@@ ting this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the outcome , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they will be treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in the pres@@ et@@ ting , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs . &quot;
&quot; intense after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the auto @-@ jump mode , this attitude determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white signs using the selected file used as a source . ( pres@@ et manual selection ) This is useful when white signs in many files is less important . if you are considering the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments are enabled .
these options are covered in the chapter on scanning of folders and duc@@ ts . look for details of documentation on the directory comparison and assem@@ bling .
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version will be displayed . if already such a back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g exists , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ use it . ( this option is available in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set there globally through the control centre . ) &quot;
the following enco@@ ding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you have enabled this option for all entries the upper setting is used .
over the drop @-@ areas for co@@ ding appears a short note that is the local enco@@ ding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . since the co@@ ding is individually adjustable for each file , even files can be compared and combined with different enco@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; when you have processed a file , you can specify which co@@ ding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing command , they might not work with your co@@ de@@ c . ( e.g. your files could be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the enco@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
&quot; turn it off to supp@@ ress conc@@ ord@@ ances of changes in white characters in the text or over@@ sight @-@ view . ( note : this applies also to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments are enabled . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a colored over@@ sized over @-@ column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . after selection from A &amp; lt ; C , A &amp; B ; C ; C is shown next to the normal still a second over@@ lap column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen preferred for long lines . download simply the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
ranks the comparative window next to each other or other . this can also be useful to display long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click launches the compilation and uses the file name of the last source file as a pre@@ viewed name for output files , then the name of the last source file will be maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is transferred first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . for example , you can use this function e.g. to cut disturbing parts or correc@@ ting the correction . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is passed first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when inser@@ tion this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre @-@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each entry line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility when inser@@ ting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users wish to program this not even program . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the input into large letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ ) \ 1 / &apos; . the \ \ 1 in the extension string refers to the found text in the first cl@@ amp string . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in big letters .
&quot; CV@@ S and other version control systems require some keywords in order to add automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word \ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and maybe you may have this regular expression even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ign@@ ore of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . however , it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ ond . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos;@@ Each character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable matches , and every single hits is replaced by nothing , thus virtually deleted . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ aliz@@ ations at one time . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; , to separate the compositions from one another . example : &quot;
&quot; instead , instead , you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Re@@ placement / switch &apos; However , per@@ l needs only ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the forward &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for the display and the merger . further operations change only the data that is seen from the line @-@ end @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the second @-@ type Pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ process as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
often programmers have to process programmers in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ taining and merge .
... is making a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ;
... can sim@@ ulate the assem@@ bling and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without making them really perform .
&quot; run selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is similar to the same and assem@@ bling of individual files very similar . you just need to open a folder on the command line or the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders are combined , then folder is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , and diff@@ use 3 ; folder @-@ 3 as the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merger . to start working , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder informs you a little news window above the current progress . if you dis@@ closing the folder , only the files are listed , which are compared to that . &quot;
&quot; when the scanning of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ... &quot;
each file and each folder that was found during the scan is presented here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object double or by clicking the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and folders with which you can split the folder .
&quot; when you click on a file , the file will be started immediately and it will appear a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; when the data type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case the inter@@ cep@@ hal@@ hr action can not be started automatically . if the merger is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind again . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; however at identical applications , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered identical , if you are identical content . then you have the same color . in folders , the age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this colour scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ y , which is only green , then yellow will be yellow , then later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... a , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the collapse can not be started . &quot;
... a and B not have the same type of file ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the collapse can not be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified and if the option directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ use the necessary action , so that both folders will be identical . if you have an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folder files . ( the user sees as the visible fil@@ ename for the output files only B ; directly after the merger copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are combined and select the option new file instead of assem@@ bling ( uns@@ ure ) then examined &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the exact date appears , but the date is identical .. As long as such bugs are not removed , the combination of the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; while inter@@ connection will lead a file after the other . it &apos;s status column shows , if the mer@@ ging successfully occurred , and accordingly other messages , when something nonsense entered , you should make a final test and check if the status is anywhere . &quot;
&quot; when in the furnishing dialog , the file comparable method of full analysis is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 other columns will display . these contain the number of sol@@ itude , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts is only displayed when three files are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected item ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all the inter@@ cep@@ hal@@ ation actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merger . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode , C is used as a destination , when the Two @-@ Fol@@ der Coll@@ ectors will be chosen as the target and used for syn@@ cing A and / or B as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options to be covered by certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ favorable surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select fil@@ esystem / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cuts ) . to run only the current entry or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conflic@@ ting data types still exist invalid co @-@ actions exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options lead , sim@@ ulate and break down . &quot;
choose sim@@ ulate if you just want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; diff@@ use certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( connecting a single file ) , then opens a combination window ( note the screenshot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select once again or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry continues . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages . if you choose to skip the cause of the problem . if you choose to choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding to the merger . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were combined individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and performs it at the later form of all entries . even if the merger has been over@@ taking or not saved , these entries will be considered settled . only if you change the merger action , these entries will be re @-@ assembled . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory connection with these options :
&quot; only files that match to the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the pres@@ et@@ ting is * . folders do not have to match this pattern . &quot;
&quot; files and folders correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree ; it can be more than a sample entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et@@ ting is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree ; it can be more than a sample entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et@@ ting is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a verb attribute . in other file systems , a leading point . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; when links to files : if the option is off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to Fol@@ der : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folders will lead and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that a link to a folder that would lead to a final loop . ) This option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; a complete analysis of each file leads through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ der , non @-@ welded and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if they are applied to files that do not contain text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare big folders over a slow network , it may be faster , only the change date and file size does compare . however , this option will cost you a certain degree of security . please use the default option . &quot;
&quot; similarly as familiar to the change date . there is no real comparison place . the files are considered identical , if they are equal in size . this can be useful for example when copying the cancellation date . please use the default option . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was then selected , that both folders will be identical . also , the results of the combination of files are stored in both folders . this option is switched on in the default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is considered uncertain , because the other file has not been modified . you should do this in any case . ) This option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; when a file or folder is replaced or deleted , then the original version will be ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file has already existed , so this is used without further backup . this also concerns the normal combination of single files , not just the inter@@ connecting link folder . this option is switched on in the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder summ@@ ons are visible on the combination of individual files ; you can switch the window @-@ window with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the option directory &amp; text window , turn the window or text window and switch between the list and text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking here . however , in the directory menu you can also run a corresponding menu item . once you save the result , the status will be placed on , and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status goes lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : new &quot;
KDE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sla@@ ves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders for opening on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line contains a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ own . or .. contain . this is with URLs not possible , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special signs need to be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , id@@ line - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a brief list of restrictions : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be differenti@@ ated whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is accepted as a link @-@ target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the permission or change date from the original . ( see the option confidential of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of the main purpose is currently the differences of viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op will initially always start the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu . &quot;
normally needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; two full input files takes . if it is applied as a CT file &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and choose from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exist . besides this is un@@ reliable if the original files have been changed since the patch file .
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part run , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist , comp@@ are ) are already there . besides , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can work together as the program diff@@ use 3 out of the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I already use GPL @-@ programs already very long and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone through this path or going to go .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and specified the configure script probably not the proper pre@@ fix to KDE . in the pres@@ et@@ ting installed configure in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. c@@ diff@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more detailed information on this issue . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs are different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only one @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if you are lines the next to each other , this is the most of this col@@ is of the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will notice for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . however , this important information is simply lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is much effort to design a separate file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort was so far too big . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text should be used another editor .
after removing text suddenly turns ; no sr@@ c left ; published and the text does not let extingu@@ ish . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&quot; diff@@ diff@@ use : many colors are used to highlight some differences . even more , it would be confusing and lacking the purpose . please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile &amp; diff@@ use ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; install and install , use the following command at the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ dir gives you the folder in your system , installed in the KDE . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and ven@@ ding machine uses , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . however , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut off ( C@@ g @-@ X or Shift removal ) copied to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ paste ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replace the current marking .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read changes to these options the folder with the Update Update . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries displayed to show the differences . this also includes that identical files are not already copied to the target folder , if the target folder will not already exist in the target folder . ( the behavior will be cancelled in a later program version . ) This option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached on one of the buttons , the lines from the appropriate window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) , they will be back on the button accordingly again . &quot;
&quot; in the pres@@ et@@ ting , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ show of all virtual work@@ space . it is fairly handy to see the ongoing programs on the desktop , to change its size or move it . this works both inside a desktop and with multiple . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ in ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces , as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , window will be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop space and other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on , if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if however , the context menu has to set up only two entries P@@ ager ... and Be@@ aming . if however , the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries can minimize , maxim@@ ise , On desktop and filling . the commands bring the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop space . appears only when applied to an application .
&quot; is this sti@@ ff@@ field marked , you can move windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working spaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the name of the virtual working spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ space ; the numbers of virtual work@@ space are displayed , together with name show , the names are provided with Ord@@ in@@ al@@ Pay , cash ; 1 working space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as the background inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty space buttons are shown to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows the window with proportions of the program window . symbol displays the window with its standard symbol and pixels . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be determined : classic , &amp; k@@ p@@ ager will appear : in a 2x@@ n @-@ R@@ aster , as from P@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers , wa@@ agre@@ eing shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal and vertically in a vertically row , which is very good for displaying lateral on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini @-@ Program in the Control Panel . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , the windows as symbols or with their content can be displayed and moved . &quot;
click the right mouse button inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent alignment can be set by re@@ tool@@ ing ... let the dialog settings appear .
at the moment the settings may not be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually :
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ an@@ c using any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you do not have any des@@ ks for the file , you must register as user root or register to your system administrator . in this file you need to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ rating mode and indicate this one value . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is set , you need a functioning installation of KDE packages . &quot;

&quot; you can use a screen saver . you can use a magni@@ fier . this application is interesting for different users : this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers . &quot;
&quot; launch a window as shown above , appears a window like above . the main window of the screen . below is the enlarged area of the screen . in the following this window will be displayed as a magni@@ fier window , is an enlarged area of the screen , and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , enlar@@ ges &amp; k@@ ills ; the area around the mouse pointer like a movable lam@@ bs . alternatively , you can add a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the cursor on the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor . please note that the mouse cursor is still not able to recognize the shape of the cursor . this is always the standard @-@ k@@ d ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mas@@ on and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor in the enlargement window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture the content of the enlargement window and move . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally push the &amp; Shift key , press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will be fixed and only the lower right corner to move .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can copy the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy it to the clip@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , rot@@ ate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stopping the update of the ad . the stopping the update means that the required CPU time goes against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , low , average , high , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will display . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&quot; Google may use your recorded short commands to save files , opening a new window , print , no@@ vices ( with the button to load once again in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ging and res@@ ili@@ s &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; may well known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen saver . you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small printed in a newspaper or photo . this application is for different people of use : from research , or artists to the web@@ designer or se@@ ers . &quot;

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click as soon as the mouse cursor is a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ test@@ Syndrome ) and those of each click pain .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , once the mouse cursor is a while at the same point . it is intended to help people who em@@ ulate on the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises from clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also use pain that are connected with the use of your computer , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to avoid using the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by removing the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for each different . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse @-@ click as soon as you dis@@ rupt the movement shortly .
&quot; is the intelligent inter@@ locking enabled , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is running the mouse button . now move the mouse button down to the end of the movement , before the slogan of the mouse will run . the smart phones requires a little practice , but you get used quickly . &quot;
this residence time must be pet@@ ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; one mouse @-@ click .
&quot; is an intelligent de@@ ple@@ tion switched on , the turn@@ field of wast@@ ing time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting before the mouse button is waiting again , if the mouse does not let the mouse take place because of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicking through mouse displ@@ ac@@ ement . this function is enabled , creates a slow down right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow cover is saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can later be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can drop &amp; k@@ de ; to do this to shor@@ ten the reaction times . here , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound @-@ system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der Sound buffer to shor@@ ten the answers to a lower value to shor@@ ten the answers . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please check the respective documentation to figure out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all the settings back , which were set at opening the dialog . have you already pushed the button , the settings will be applied to the state after the last drop . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first use the pre @-@ settings . in particular , the intelligent reloc@@ ate should initially be switched off . if you have then acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the automatic shut@@ down , you can later increase the intelligent move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the answer times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of what places a mouse @-@ click does not remain without effect : clicking on the neutral constitu@@ ents of windows or on places in the browser window that does not link to un@@ paid reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse rested , you should clean@@ se your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take the mouse button . as this happens , from mouse to mouse differently . it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you need to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole , in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can easily cr@@ ush with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks down the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;ve just begun to move into this case , that &apos;s that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the operation can no longer end by the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under another window manager use and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can execute yourself a mouse @-@ click . this becomes the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text is temp@@ ted &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place .
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there , where you want to place it . however , you do not need to call the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you don &apos;t encounter any more desirable mouse clicks . secure zones for the toolbar and menus and the cover @-@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart phones , but I do not manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to move it to the clip@@ board and move again or move any other action you want to move into the clip@@ board . but there will probably be problems for them . here are some advice about this : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent delay , if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; highlight text instead , follow the mouse button down , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and enter the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . therefore , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when you use the intelligent reloc@@ ating the mer@@ ging time . later you can use the intelligent shifting even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case in most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and this is correct .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is shortly ver@@ able . this program has been developed for people that are suffering on R@@ SI syndrome and those who are the actu@@ ators of the mo@@ sten pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so it is a certain time that a gyp@@ sy process begins , before the mouse button begins . in this way , the pulling and dra@@ gging with the mouse can be done . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows the mu@@ te user to speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; there can be bl@@ ur@@ red users to speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the inter@@ s@@ words that are to be discussed again .
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( lin@@ kes screen shot ) enter the command , which is later used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the furniture . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text message . from the text pass@@ agen@@ als you can often select text passages , without having to tap into . the passages can of course be processed . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right Screen photo ) , you determine the dictionary for the vocabulary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can download the lists of words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly letters have been recorded in the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a l@@ apse of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; correctly included , you can enter in the input field the propositions which you want to hear . each spoken set is attached to the log @-@ memory . you can choose from it that are to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu item Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog box contains two cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ supplement and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the cart@@ ei@@ card voice @-@ output , enter the command to call the voice @-@ generator . in the selection field under the input field , you specify the character enco@@ ding , with the text to be passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text . choose the cross field , if the text is to be passed as default to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check@@ box is not selected , the text is shared as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation about your language generator . examples of this can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; use as a language service as a language service is available &amp; k@@ mouth ; when the first is trying to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings on this page is provided and that is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box promotion after the selection of a text , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cuts or by selecting a text from the menu text pass@@ book or in the bar for text files . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ cks , the selected text settings will be directly spoken and in addition to the storage box . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text will initially only be entered in the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box Connect of the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can specify whether the text message book at the switch of the editing window will be automatically saved . &quot;
&quot; save the book , save the book . if you choose any changes , the text message book will not be saved . choose the text message , will be saved &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text message book is to be saved . &quot;

&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asked , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these must be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically adds into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for the processing of text files is split . in the upper part , the text is displayed as a tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text message , you can change the text settings or the associated keyboard short@@ cuts . if you have selected a text message book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text passages or books add or selected text passages and books can be deleted either by selecting in the menu bar , in the toolbar or via a folding menu . &quot;

probably you have the command for the voice @-@ output not properly or not completely entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the page General settings and enter the instruction for voice output on the card issue . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer to further details . )
&quot; festival is a voice @-@ output system of the university Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ ically supported . the license allows to use the Festival free of charge and distribute it without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a Java language generator . currently , he only supports the English language . currently , it supports only the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and distribute it without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; in order to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice edition , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following instruction examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must send data to default . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ one@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ry , so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows it to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la will be installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax will gladly advise the last character of the text so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ ro@@ la / / usr / local / usr / local / usr / local / / 1 / dev / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option must send data to default .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ is of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ output systems . &quot;
&quot; because the adjustment of the language @-@ generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as possible as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; for setting , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service that appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful use , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , text by the computer . it will be a list already saved , which allows users to re @-@ release the user again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer involves . on the machine a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&quot; the first start of t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or long as long as no speaker are set up , the card card speaker is displayed . see also if you have at least one speaker , the card card will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most of the T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or such , which is different from language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , sex , volume and speed is called spokes@@ person before you go &amp; kt@@ ts ; use the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the default speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to several printing plates for the same printer .
&quot; when you click on the card editor in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card speaker will appear . it will then automatically start when you start t@@ t@@ sm@@ s@@ gr@@ and is still no speaker . &quot;
all listed speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list . the top speaker will be used for the voice output if there is no speaker .
&quot; choose a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; click with a mouse @-@ click for a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; click with a mouse @-@ click for a speaker from the list , and click on this button to slide the speaker in the list below . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; desktop ;
&quot; select a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girls to choose from . &quot;
&quot; click here , appears on the new speaker on the map speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already you can use it . go back to the card card , and check if the T@@ TS service is set by &amp; k@@ de ; see . now , you can use the T@@ TS @-@ Service . click on the map orders to create text presentations and manage . see . &quot;
&quot; when you set up at least one speaker , you can start the language file system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the cardboard card left to open this card card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; highlight the cross @-@ field in order to activate the package ; this starts the KDE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text orders and check out . see . remove the marking , the TT@@ SD card will keep and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;

&quot; with the buttons in this row you can start text orders , cancel , stop and resume . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or to read a text file for pre @-@ reading . you can also change the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click on it or OK , then all modified settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; map orders will be displayed only if K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card of the card and cross the output file ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check out the text that is intended to be read and select the main menu tools text . after a short time , the voice @-@ output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML are also pre @-@ read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ ate ; the enlarged text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read out the text . check out the text that is intended to be read and select the main menu tools text . then the voice @-@ output should start . &quot;

&quot; in conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set different types of messages . for example , set up a message that occurs in a IR@@ C channel , in which your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C communication text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ d ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for the notification differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for drawing up is a good possibility to correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is included to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you will be sent the tags and b from the messages sent by the mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since this in most cases can be assumed as assumed . &quot;
filter are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; filtering is dealt with text , before he is sent to the program Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the language to select false language and speakers or to deal with certain defects of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; sets four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has drawn the highest priority . it is drawn up to all other entries and keeps these orders . if the edition of Screen reader is pre @-@ read , the continued orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the warning issue .
&quot; News have the next highest priority . a message under@@ goes normal lyrics . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of application to read the news . while you have a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; somebody who just enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order , which you can purchase from the card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications , the text orders are used . text entries are intended for the output longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are worked in queue , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ reading , this edition will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers . you will be applied to regular war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as to &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filters . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are carried out as modules . in future there can be further types of filters .
string trans@@ duc@@ er replace parts of a text by other text . the exec@@ utable parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions . the creation of chat @-@ bucket such as : - ) by text or for the reform@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Um@@ form@@ ers use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; available in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker output , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program you send to a speaker . if you have set up a female voice for example , you can read text by KDE news about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. also read it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice @-@ output . if the filter does not determine that its rules does not exist , he will continue to follow the text unchanged . &quot;
&quot; when a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ al@@ erts on &amp; kt@@ ts ; skill@@ fully , it is edited by all activated filters , which are set up in the list in the order from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the equipped normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not enabled and is not used . filter are processed the row from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and it will be displayed below
&quot; for the establishment of strings words , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding sub@@ text . large and small @-@ sp@@ elling will not be observed when compared . &quot;
enter a name for your filter name . you can choose from that name you just have to distinguish from the name of the other filter .
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter is compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replace it in accordance with the string . the list is processed in the order shown above . &quot;
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save the current list or delete a file from a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is registered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker is displayed for the text message here . click on the button to display a list of languages . click on the button to view a list of languages , if you click at the mouse @-@ click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is only used if the text is used by one of the specified applications . for example : conversation , mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID @-@ related programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; number , you need to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 displays , you may only enter copies . &quot;
&quot; the string composition filter is used only then applied to the text , when all conditions are applied with an entry in the box dialog . are all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all text . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the character sound regul@@ ator filter regul@@ arity in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( space signs ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing of regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regulatory or editing , you can call it in the dialog box or editing . the &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; expression can be found in the package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; -@@ Shift translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from a format into another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such revers@@ als . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the manual program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable PA@@ TH also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; using the Spe@@ aker filters , you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the map speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . you can for example specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text sent to the filters , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker . the speaker is selected using the speaker , and the features that can be found on the map speaker . with the Spe@@ aker optional , you can over@@ write the speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is applied , if the text is applied to the regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ators , you can call this with a click on the button to get help with the entry . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; &quot;
&quot; here you specify the properties of the desired speaker . if the text is filled the above filter conditions , the speaker will be chosen to display the desired requirements . click on the button to the right to display the dialog box . &quot;
use this buttons to store or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the speaker filter is used only then applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box dialog . you have to register at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer to lend their applications T@@ TS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &apos;s syn@@ thesizer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; D ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of the voice @-@ edition of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice services through the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; the text of the text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg , en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all orders please enter
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . start only lower in one window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the named language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ forming filter , but using the module for the festival website will not be read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able at all works . you &apos;ll also need to do so if you cannot find this voice to pre @-@ read web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and about the ambient variable PA@@ TH . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or punc@@ tu@@ ation appear to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences is over@@ thrown , or only chew@@ ing @-@ worlds . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option string is set to the right value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be fixed by a string composition filter . &quot;

&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that are not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a customizable module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ sl@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; to compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or new ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when you download the source texts of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for cut@@ out or download the whole night created tar@@ ball , translate and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher operates correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer right . for this , you can use the shell script SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be developed so further , that the establishment of Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is disper@@ sed in individual sentences . the user can only go back and drop back , repe@@ ating the output or break off . &quot;
&quot; if an application has text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can specify the properties of the preferred spokes@@ man for the output . if you want to have a speaker , whose language English and whose gender is feminine , this will automatically be the best fitting speaker . if you want to find out more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is chosen , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map speaker to add , and thus click Edit button in the list or click Edit button . as an example , the card speaker is displayed for Festival Interactive . for details on the modules you will find on the modules . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included to the festival in PA@@ TH , you only need to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the string enco@@ ding for text that is transferred to festival . in general , this setting is automatically performed . in general , this setting is automatically performed . in general , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders you put volume , microphone speed and pitch @-@ height of synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators , and this gray can not be displayed , the voice you choose to have chosen these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark the cross field , these voices are already applied at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized by the first sentence . &quot;
&quot; if this case cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; is this sti@@ ff@@ field marked , will be displayed at the start of t@@ t@@ sm@@ s@@ gr@@ . otherwise , after the start only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; is this sti@@ ff@@ field marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . therefore , you have the opportunity to read and control it . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application which set the order , the current status of the record , the number of propositions and the just edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can have sat@@ bil@@ ise in the order , which is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is res@@ ized for the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;

this card card allows you to set specific actions that will always be executed when the text is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
&quot; the output of screen readers has drawn the highest priority . it will be pre@@ deduc@@ ted from all other entries and keeps them posted . after the edition of Screen reader has been read , the requested jobs will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next primary priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor will be reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message under@@ goes normal lyrics . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you have a long text on a website , you can greet you with &amp; k@@ mouth . nevertheless someone welcome you to enter the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ output in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played , if a normal text is interrupted . if both introductory sound as well as introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card apply only for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and expenses of screen readers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to leave with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages to be read , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card noti@@ fications appears . &quot;
&quot; select this check@@ box to switch the pre @-@ read of &amp; k@@ de ; cause disadvantage , this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and swe@@ eten ; does not read any noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button Add button , in which you want to select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message of your nick@@ name . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else indicated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this select field to specify , what to do , if an event meets . you have the following selections : &quot;
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map speaker as the top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . is defined for a certain event of a certain application , this will be executed . otherwise , the action for all the other events of the particular application is executed . as the last possibility comes the action for wearing , which is set under Standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the button Save to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries except All disadvantage are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice @-@ output . this standard includes brands for controlling voices , the volume , the volume of voice and pitch . moreover , brands for controlling the pr@@ on@@ unciation from for example letter . SS@@ ML is part of the avi@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish masculine ) because this is the default voice that the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
&quot; if the settings for speed or keys in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; 1.0 / / EN / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama Bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the B@@ ären@@ kind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . SB@@ Ds can also proceed faster with the pre @-@ reading filter , as only the first set does not need to pre @-@ jump or stop and break off , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this . &quot;
&quot; here you see the limits of limits filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pro@@ clamation of the limits filter is automatically furnished , but you can change its settings or add further typing filters , starting up , but of that . &quot;
&quot; on the easiest way you learn the establishment of the speaker selections by try . switch the speaker selection once again . turn off the speaker card , and check out how the selection of the speaker has changed . of course , you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; note ; then faster with the pre @-@ reading can start , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole word block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; they will then stop orders or break up on the map orders , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the normal proposition @-@ bound@@ ing filter is automatically set up , if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it can not be off , only removed . change anything about this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
pro@@ posi@@ tional filter compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) at the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( dec@@ imal sign are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard proposition @-@ limits filter is attached .
&quot; SB@@ D filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ icks ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from Ver@@ see the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter , you can insert it again by adding the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the map selection , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed when &quot;
use of the standard speakers ( the top on the map speaker ) . in other words : there are no speaker properties .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker , which shows all the properties of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker . otherwise chooses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from the most original features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker features by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature does not play a role , don &apos;t give anything . &quot;
&quot; select this cross @-@ field , if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also put several markings . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it will always be treated as a priority property . the only case where you may specify the attribute language , if you know that a certain application text is sent in another language than that of the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the speaker , the most obvious to the following corresponds to delete , click the mouse button to use default speakers and then use for speaker , which corresponds to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 for the final text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the entry 0 required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s@@ gr@@ ace@@ ae immediately off when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any back@@ tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is de@@ posed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was finished , probably you have to register G@@ stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved by G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; the audio @-@ output of AL@@ SA does not work when I keep playing music at the same time using another application , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that bes@@ ts : &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
on your system the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA can prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . hints for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ Projects ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ect@@ .org .
I loaded an extra voice for the festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use them in the festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr shows that voice .
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / t@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / h the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the cardboard card audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed and over the ambient variable PA@@ TH . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ ul@@ s like Festival Interactive offer yourself on the card card for speaker . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; ( this is because the HTML is controlled in SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are completely brave , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ formed filter , and set the intercom speed . &quot;
&quot; I do not manage that websites with a female voice can be read . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at the Festival 1,@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able Gender seems not to work . so that festival does not produce any mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber &apos;s gender tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate string composition filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sat@@ bil@@ ise pre@@ - or go back . on the cardboard boxes , order is shown only out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation mark ( point , frac@@ ture , punc@@ tu@@ ation , com@@ ma and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . use a filter instead of the statutes . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA &apos;s conflicts during the audio output . if your system counts too , you can not simultaneously play music and check a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; free@@ zes also , if you stop a text order and then launch another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support a real break . if you hold a text message in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the current sentence will be read yet . &quot;

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check whether your voice syn@@ thesizer right works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , microphone speeds and pitch . &quot;
you must install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are delivered with festival . do you want to read web pages you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice is set up at the Festival 1,@@ 95 beta or new . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the Russian voices , you have to enter the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ n@@ sh _ n@@ sh _ n@@ sh _ n@@ sh _ n@@ sh ( 8 @-@ bit ) co@@ ding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore look for festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the code must be adjusted to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ isch , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then , the Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; this creates the audio @-@ output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; - voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no complete language file system is . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates additional software to create this Di@@ phone . festival generates these by &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; needed Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
&quot; with this method , additional Wr@@ apper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; - voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; mb@@ one files are not installed in the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; folder files , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German festival is an altered version of Festival for German &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; - voices . required either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install the Festival and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then download MS German Festival of &quot;

&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice syn@@ thesizer , which has been written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; virtual machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can neither adjust tape , volume and intercom speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in one &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice @-@ output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this handbook explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : , a module for the &amp; paste center ; that allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; paste center ; can be called by selecting K Menu P@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; paste center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , there is a new module network settings in the &amp; paste center ; it can be started by selecting a paste center ; Internet &amp; network interface settings in the &amp; menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : the device at all indicates and allow the setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed at installing &amp; Linux ; they are installed and installed . network devices later added , the drivers must be loaded through adaptation of the following files , corresponding to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the module configuration settings will be loaded if the option is selected in the &amp; paste center ; -@@ index is selected . at the start of the module , the module is trying to automatically detect the platform used at the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can not be detected , the suspension selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and release date is best suited . through mark@@ ers of setting non @-@ re@@ ques@@ tioning the definition can be continued permanently . at the next start of network settings then this selection will be automatically set . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . before , all options are gray presented , which means the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you will only be able to enter the system administration mode at the lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three hor@@ semen : &quot;
&quot; the tab network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the settings of the selected network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog device setup .
&quot; by default , there are only basic TCP / IP settings available . click the but@@ ton@@ ed settings showing the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with selecting Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system will be necessary with the start of system services . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
with the selection Manual can be made using DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field network mask .
&quot; if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface with boats . if the initi@@ alization does not wish , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered into this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the box .
&quot; it should be assured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched on as required . incoming of an out@@ dated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched on as required . switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and selecting interface ....
&quot; att@@ aches the IP address of the computer in local network @-@ network , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is more than one network interface , the interface to the net is to be selected in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only requirement IP addresses . if the machine is htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org the DNS does not trigger this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to nam@@ ach@@ ment part of the equ@@ ator nam@@ ach@@ ment allows easy management of this list . entries can be added or altered or altered items in the list with buttons or pick up in the list with the buttons or follow @-@ up in the priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to create a DNS server can be added a DNS server . it will display the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry is then inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; out of the group machine for naming , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog . &quot;
&quot; the above @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes computer @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used by boats if no DNS server is available . in small , locked networks , it can replace DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains a familiar machine some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . still in the test , the version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the renowned computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the renowned computer and click the Add button . if the familiar machine has multiple alias names , de button adding several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit ... The dialog to edit your computer is displayed .
&quot; it can be one of the following tasks carried out , then by clicking OK , the list of static host@@ s is updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in one &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm @-@ packages ) , it is sufficient when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic user like k@@ package or the installation tool for your distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , the development package with libraries and other things are required . &quot;
&quot; this will only be recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : to compile . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information regarding basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this section can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to penet@@ rate it in the near future . this description is therefore concentrated on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is aware of which IP address of a network interface is to be found . in external networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact person , which is a valid IP address , which is a valid IP address or if available , the IP address may not be easily chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore , any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually used addresses in the area of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are participants in the same sub @-@ network . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , which is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the standard route is needed for the IP re@@ direc@@ ting . &quot;
the power address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back @-@ interface that works as a closed circle .
&quot; in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections , so it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than determined there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file will be sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another state as expected can therefore occur .

&quot; at the start of &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list of leading tasks and corresponding environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this appears both for all users of the system and system internal tasks . each folder can be opened and folded . &quot;
&quot; with a de@@ activated task , program name and parameters are not shown and shown below is de@@ activated . &quot;
the ambient variables provided here are the otherwise existing environment variables for all tasks described above . with a de@@ activated variable appears as a description disabled .
&quot; to create a new task , select first the tasks folder . then go in the menu to Edit New .... alternative , you can also click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and in the present context menu New ... select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N press . &quot;
enter the name of the program start@@ up here . you can either specify a rel@@ ational or an absolute path names . if you want to search the program first and press out ....
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in fi@@ dd@@ ling .
&quot; when you select both Mon@@ at@@ day ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( e ) , the task will be executed on both the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will run on the 1st and 15th of the selected months regardless of the week@@ day , regardless of which date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as when creating new tasks , changes will only be active if the C@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a task , select the first to be removed first . go then to edit . &quot;

&quot; a backup program for belt drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to answer a surface for tar , the first was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take , when you sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; that can be done on three types : &quot;
&quot; get the band back and read the pres@@ t@@ ant information of the ban@@ ker . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pres@@ et on the tape do not , you will ask if the tape should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the foreg@@ one , it searches for the appropriate index on your record . this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be re@@ created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol of the belt is changing , to indicate that the band is involved . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the Ban@@ ker can now be searched out by a cl@@ apping of the entry for the belt . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the ban@@ des , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this : &quot;
&quot; in the status of a symbol for the band , the integration of the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without any danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat ; &quot;
&quot; a band @-@ types must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not match the form@@ atting when using it , it must happen before you are form@@ atted a form@@ atting of the tape , DA@@ T drives on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the ban@@ ker . all data on the tape will be lost , the band is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the files to be saved . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved to this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu She@@ ets ...
&quot; once the backup has been introduced , the dialog settings will open up . in this dialog you can once again examine the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the rate of data and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in an entry for the drive . it is checked only the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in an entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item .
&quot; once the verification process has been started , the dialog settings will appear for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the appropriate folder for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can restore the restore , the files you need to be recovered , marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the associated entry . it will only be restored the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . there are only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Again ...
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings will appear for restoration . in this dialog you can check even your selection and change the appropriate folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will be re @-@ establish . this dialog will show the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the Band@@ inde@@ x.@@ file using the belt content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two different types of tape : &quot;
&quot; thereby , a backup profile marked with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make for a backup profile the following settings : &quot;
&quot; the current work@@ station , in which the backup is to take place . the list of files to be saved is automatically updated according to the selected desktop folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folder that are listed under backup files , that only the files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folders , which are on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is from tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , it will only be saved the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all the files to be secured and created a new snapshot file for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating these documentation .
you can set up the settings of the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the complete path for the device driver ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ ap version of the belt .
&quot; if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated with load load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; is the option switched , temp@@ ted &amp; k@@ dat ; the p@@ endant in the band@@ name to block . possibly , this attitude does not work at all band@@ drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , in solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band is thrown out . use this option not at flo@@ ppy disk . &quot;
&quot; is the option switched on , temp@@ ted &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ome block size for the tape drives . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your belt drives . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the gang . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this sequence is billing : seconds , whereby calcul@@ ator is the complete name of the system , on which the tape has been form@@ atted in which the band has been form@@ atted in which the band is form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar can be used . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup system . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , or where the system provides the various protocol files , or where the system allows for quick access to information on issues that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , which can not know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system sets the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that can occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; tries to provide some extended functions , fil@@ tered and evaluated with the help of the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful features include :
support for many different types of log files for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this book .
&quot; as you see in the following screenshot , provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available , with whose help the individual protocol lines can easily filter and sort the different ways to sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting to open &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol - to open it . will not be shown with system administration right . the protocol files are usually listed in the folder / var / log , for the normal users usually no justification for reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filtering bar to filter by a selected criterion or on selected strings . in the default setting , the drop @-@ line contains beside the filter the entry . then , a protocol line contains only displayed when in one of the columns will display the string of the filter search . &quot;
&quot; you can of course select another entry in this place . select the strings in the filter panel , and enter the name of a process for example , and enter the name of a process that displays you &amp; k@@ system log ; all log lines which have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a show@@ y color as a protocol lines of level notice . the color display of protocol lines can be switched to furnishing dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can check the trial identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filtering . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to add new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new record lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log : allows display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system log@@ .@@ forum @-@ so@@ ftw@@ are.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further information on the sources of sources by &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
and you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ d ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ d ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it quickly develops the standard for controlling the program start when driving the system in the &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further here in historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about yourself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could attempt to make a machine based on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and re @-@ format . that &apos;s why you must make sure that the old In@@ it removed from there , if there was a one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of right in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folder :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start when driving the system or change to another Run@@ level . system Services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; sen@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services include not such things such as set@@ serial that will only once started . such calls do not belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems possess this file , even if you do not want to make a r@@ c.@@ log in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel looks for different points after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the default runtime is placed in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the pres@@ et Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix something that re@@ moves the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter into r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written , that it is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would hold the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the a K includes , the script is called using the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server @-@ runtime , which can only be ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . also , I could also have a user @-@ level level , the &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or a different pointer device is simple to say tri@@ vial : just drag a entry from the range of available systems services to one of the six run@@ way to start it on this level ( or stop ) . &quot;
you can also shift scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only be done if they draw an entry from the scope of the available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved if you choose to use it in a new area . to simply select it on a new Run@@ level menu , then you must explicitly select copying or from the context menu and even then when the same entry has already existed previously in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry may sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown in the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable different working areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc . ) and the cursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired level level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the button button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to change the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of loss loss , all entries in the menu commands a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are made available in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now starts the machine continuously . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default runtime level on a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration of the proprietary furniture programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an expansion of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use any other distribution , please check if all configuration files are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) just end up without message when their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user . &quot;
&quot; after you have made modifications , you must save it . either you use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry to save the file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , user and user groups . for editing the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only when you have extended systems settings , a card card will be created , where you can make individual settings . further card cards appear , if shadow passwords are installed or for example , etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD Unix . &quot;
&quot; the map password is released , if shadow passwords are installed , or for example , etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
this card card appears only if for at least a built @-@ in file system footprint ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable on the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change the par@@ amount of data in KB :
these parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected using space data system using space restriction
&quot; card card groups informed about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become member in other groups by using it in the large field . &quot;
the Di@@ alogue Properties dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group select the user in the list .
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the menu users or group or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ manager , remove the boot password , remove the default file system , remove the standard operating system , remove , modify operating systems , modify , modify and read more . &quot;
