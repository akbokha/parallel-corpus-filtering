<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar sterilization was also called Sabatier, an effect of the image shaded by the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas sheltered from the additional light. this tool was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to make this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controlled the solar sterilization. at about 50% intensity shows the image what is chemically possible. another increase finally generates a negative image, that is not to produce on photo paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and that is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that makes it a stronger contrast-effect that makes the colors brilliant and glow. try it simple but he embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight and converted colour film of the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus making a reference for his smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated fatty acids, but also some photographs, especially those of which are hardly landscapes."</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates Neon to the contrast canals. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting repeat the strength of the neon. with great images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color trast and the luminosity of the photos. you can view the various color grains of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. as soon as you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation will reduce you. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuven / contrast / Gamma, the tool is a key correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you need for the application in the area of slider. concrete the three sliders below the Histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of Intensity values, a Histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graphs are three slate into the wrapped and which can be moved to change the intensification of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but, especially in dark areas, granny images."</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like an image sharply. actually it does not work to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"focussing is perhaps the best of the three, because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without a focus, as well as most digitised images need to summarize the sound process colors with only minimal differences to a colour point. the same phenomenon can be observed if colours are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more detrimental than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG pictures, a camera is often applied to internal scissal. pictures in the blank format must always be sharpened during the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner is using a foam filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you will be able to receive chable results by sharpen a photo with the hacking value. this allows you to log in with the menu entry of basket.</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should be careful however, because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also intensifying the smoke. you can also achieve further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool to adjust softly with the menu entry basket and experiment with settings. the thumbnails on the right side of the dialog is showing you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview allows the image to process. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often create good results and should be tried out first. an increase of radius or amount will reinforce the effect. if you make the unsharpness mask too strongly, smokers will generate noise and the impression of grass in the proximity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edges has been affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. you should therefore sharpen them best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the original image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the differential amount. thus, these areas are used with a soft change between the sounds of sharpen and hence glow in facial, Heavens and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of blurred mashing Filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a Corpora = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & checking came; tool refocused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used to identify the protected unfolding filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">"this tool tries to read a picture & quot; refocussing quot; in which it is a better approach than to try to sharpen the photo. the traditional technique for the sharpening of images is the use of a wired mask. you can start it from the menu by setting colors Refocus in image editing."</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular fly works much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which results in most cases even very strongly influenced by the original pixel. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular loop: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images the default value should result in 1 good results. you can put a higher value if your picture is very blurred but then on Heiligenstadt.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0,1 can be low. however, the image quality is very poor. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will keep the picture still further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche Schärfe: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche Schärfe. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal zero, so you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the smoking filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformational size. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results. however, note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the area of 3-10. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cutting, color and Intensity corrections on the image before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible immediately, but the later unpleasant artifacts leave."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred mashing better results as scissors. this could be caused by causing the unsharp masking a bigger neighborhood as a sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, the result of the FIR filter has never to remove artefacts. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimum linear filter. the FIR filter filter is often better at the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is attributable to insufficient light for auto-focus lenses.</seg>

<seg id="513">The regulator Glätte sets the insharpen of the area that was darkened to generate a natural pacille.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the color tints allows a customized color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool detector is one of the most sophisticated tool to remove the desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The owner has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starter points to simplify the restoration. the options available are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"in case you want to use the filtering settings to you, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailing regulp [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of details. a small value leads to a evenly smoothed over the image. a value of 0.9 should be careful about the image. a value of 0.9 should be noted, please note that the detailled position always should be subordinate."</seg>
<seg id="520">Riding dependence of Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothed evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is only in one direction. if you create a movie granularity or CCD Raue will create a high value in wave-like patterns. JPEG artifacts will best be eliminated with a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">"[0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothation factor above allotp then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of smoking in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is multiplied, because it is then difficult to create the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turmock effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: returns how often the algorithm is going through. usually here is 1 or 2 out.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle gradual since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropen Alpha. if Alpha small is chosen, it should also be small chosen. therefore, be sure to choose small angles a long term. so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to suit your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step [0.1, 10]: integrated stride-wide in pixels. you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2. "</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality that you get through a choice of this option is only minor. but he doubles the term. we recommend it to allow him to release it.</seg>

<seg id="528">"correct graphical errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button breakout."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how graphical errors can be removed using little artefacts. the module is used on a photo that is caused in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is an independent black fact during the journey caused by a poor film deposit while the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & checking came; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce imaging. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters available to remove stains and other artifacts such as dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensors from camera or Moiding; - effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain in default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values increase the time that the filters are used per pixel and can smoothed the image above the picture and the color in it is smoothed, and therefore smaller bugs."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the noise level. this value sets the pixel standings to determine the light weight changes. if it is increased, smokers will need to change the channel filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and smoke or lubrication again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the cantonal accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong does not remove the whole smoker or smokers can occur. put him on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a watchdog or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controlled the luminance of the image. we recommend either color or light density to change in order to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of using the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color intolerance of the picture. we recommend either color or light density to improve one image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of using the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas which typically have stronger bolted to increase. however, it disappeared also to the shadow areas. "</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the adjustment of the phasenjatterdamping. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filtration radius on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges can occur when it is too high, rustling and phasenjitter can occur to the edges. he can remove roughs and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">"storing and store: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction, which you have set, can be saved into the file system and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smokers can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2) and the screams was applied with the default settings.</seg>

<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very good adapted to removing Gauß'en, compressor, scratches, compressor factory, and local errors that arise in digital, original or subsequent digitised images. the smoothing is done along the picture contours and thus maintains the content as well as the human eye."</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text replacement. the textile composition is carried out with another tool that has been implemented by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannosis and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy combustible compressor; - small standards that are seen in the uncompressed picture. this attitude should correct these problems."</seg>

<seg id="561">Durcut: it is determined an average of the neighboring pixel. the resulting color will be assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a gap of 1 of the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to pixel block will be drawn to a bi-square surface (1-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolishing the pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="1042">"when a picture is rounded with only one beam per pixel, there can often be different mistakes. these images often have a Moirè pattern or piece-effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are in the representation smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing, to reduce the influence of these errors. in general, pictures with this feature is better off."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you switch anti-aliasing, computed and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because every pixel is always split and adaptive because the recursioning loop depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"when you choose the first method, POV-Ray controls a beam per pixel. if the difference between the shades of pixels with super-sampling, then both pixel will be calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixels."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -B 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values the pre-defined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixel, which can be followed individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be set with lowering."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of smoking for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn jittering, changed & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount, to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last adjustment for the quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray. it takes a very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you necessarily want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this attitude."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for use of freeDB is needed, the geographically on the next flying mirror server is to be used within the network and balances the load between calculators."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrors for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created) only the actualizations of the database.</seg>

<seg id="1538">The Kodierer-package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coding is used. this is also necessary for pre-defined encoders. for more information about Kodiers can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a code, more information about his switches can be obtained through the entry of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolenwindow (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed code."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events will be translated into events that synthesizer the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Typs Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Typs Change patch to Trumpet and thus always let a trumpet sound, if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a sound card, you do not need MIDI-map because all soundcards are GM -compatible (including Awe - and CIS cards, FM radio devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand (using your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that saves all required requirements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section which may appear as often as desired. for this, however, that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "name of Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END...</seg>
<seg id="1659">"you see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END, that the end of a section is reached."</seg>
<seg id="1660">"please send me your map file as e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid, support for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section, how the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the gender sign is ignored. it is believed that the GM patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you must not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"optional All KeysTo M is needed to put all sounds, which supports this instrument (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun powder. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if so, if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (tissues), it takes 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the note 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, where each sound is a different percussioner instrument (drums, Maracas & etc.) and not the one who means the sound the pitch-height of the always same drum (as does some keyboards possess)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how sounds are depicted on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with PATCHMAP section is the order of lines very important, as well as their presence. you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form sounds on the Perkicks canal. watch yourself as an example the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to exchange some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, you simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for Keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (general MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section thus has 16 lines, numbered between 0 and 15, assembled according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n is the channel, which is used on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap is used with the name Name for this channel. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the Perkpiece patch on the Perkchat channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitchmarking Ratio there are in which relation Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event with the value n (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used to be in the map file no decimal number).</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM announces that a keyboard player has to play with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards around two tones to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-map, simply open the dialog settings. you can find this in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument that is not more green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to display the played sounds. the view select Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. if you find example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a music piece. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc.. this can result the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can force anybody to do, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB (a compression file 4 MB) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binärdistribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; without Awe support has been compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid). "</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"agree to support & kmid; drag and drop. just open the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"before, you are sure to activate the settings automatic add to the collection. otherwise the files are added to temporary collection."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the contributors had made a lot of changes and at the same time had corrected the repayment at the same time. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during the merger.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps just the backwards had changed. the collapse of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3 was able to display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you would like to compare text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparision window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function changed & kdiffuse, almost in a complete file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way connection will be fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently in one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve any changes. in this editor you can even edit the result. in this editor you can even edit the outcome. the screenshot showing three quell files at the same time:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the same and together complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when you create a folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& diffuse 3; shows the exact differences and control the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you have to check Kode you will like to check this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabs are shown visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no anger more, if someone change the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files are the same name, but in different folders, you can easily write the typo by simply writing the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Ordner2 folder diffuse 3 folder-3 folder folders and diffuse 3 folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 folder folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">"opening-dialog allows the manual type of filename, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting an finally opened file from the listing list. opening your selection and displays it next time. you do not need to specify third file; when you have the entry for C to be empty, the analysis of differences with two files is carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"using the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons and merging of folders will be selected, then uses a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"when interconnecting is interwoven, the input field is active for the goal and can handle itself. however, it is not necessarily required to define immediately an output file. you can get this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens up a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start with the same / collapse.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes one does not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison starts then immediately. in opening dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop pulling out: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains such a similar effort. if you want to find out how much these functions are, it would just be a relatively large amount of effort. you would need to upload two appropriate files, paste it into & diffuse. now you can simply copy the relevant sections simply, paste and then compare."</seg>

<seg id="2302">"warning: several editors interpret the pulling and insertion of text into another program as alignment and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each word window, the Info-line contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and number of the first visible row in the window.

<seg id="2306">"links next to the text is found the summaries. when differences were found, the column shows the appropriate color. with some programming languages the color is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes.

<seg id="2307">"the vertical line that separates the abstracts column of text, is interrupted by the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the case-enumeration is activated, the line is displayed on broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (among the comparative issue) also has a info-line with the wording of the file name:, the filename and [changed] if you have processed the result. usually it includes the automatic computation already text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>

<seg id="2941">"& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, which can not know where you can obtain information about your system, or where the system sets the various protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that can occur on their server. & ksystemlog; tries to provide some extended functions, filtered and evaluated with the help of the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystemlog; a number of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this book.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshot, provides & ksystemlog; features available, with whose help the individual protocol lines can easily filter and sort the different ways to sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after starting to open & ksystemlog; first, the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protocol - to open it. will not be shown with system administration right. the protocol files are usually listed in the folder / var / log, for the normal users usually no justification for reading."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filtering bar to filter by a selected criterion or on selected strings. in the default setting, the drop-line contains beside the filter the entry. then, a protocol line contains only displayed when in one of the columns will display the string of the filter search."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can of course select another entry in this place. select the strings in the filter panel, and enter the name of a process for example, and enter the name of a process that displays you & ksystem log; all log lines which have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a showy color as a protocol lines of level notice. the color display of protocol lines can be switched to furnishing dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), so you can check the trial identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filtering."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can jump the option to add new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new record lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog: allows display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystem log.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further information on the sources of sources by & ksystemlog.</seg>
<seg id="2955">And you can also find in the following folder of the & kd; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in the & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kd; system V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init quickly develops the standard for controlling the program start when driving the system in the & Linux; therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here in historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about yourself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sam and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone could attempt to make a machine based on System V Init, without a reinstallation and re-format. that's why you must make sure that the old Init removed from there, if there was a one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init is also different from BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of right in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following further folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start when driving the system or change to another Runlevel. system Services include such things like network, NFS, & senmail;, httpd & etc. system services include not such things such as setserial that will only once started. such calls do not belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems possess this file, even if you do not want to make a rc.log in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks for different points after the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runtime is placed in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the preset Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can fix something that removes the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter into rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written, that it is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the a K includes, the script is called using the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server-runtime, which can only be httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. also, I could also have a user-level level, the & kdm;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"the use of & ksysv; with a mouse or a different pointer device is simple to say trivial: just drag a entry from the range of available systems services to one of the six runway to start it on this level (or stop)."</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only be done if they draw an entry from the scope of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you choose to use it in a new area. to simply select it on a new Runlevel menu, then you must explicitly select copying or from the context menu and even then when the same entry has already existed previously in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry may sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown in the Recycle Bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable different working areas (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc.) and the cursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another Runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired level level with insertion (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the button button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to change the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of loss loss, all entries in the menu commands a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are made available in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc). otherwise they are saved by & ksysv. changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln and now starts the machine continuously. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runtime level on a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way services are launched in these distributions, simplifies the configuration of the proprietary furniture programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an expansion of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use any other distribution, please check if all configuration files are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just end up without message when their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>

<seg id="2991">"after you have made modifications, you must save it. either you use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry to save the file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, user and user groups. for editing the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only when you have extended systems settings, a card card will be created, where you can make individual settings. further card cards appear, if shadow passwords are installed or for example, etc / master.passwd as in BSD Unix."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the map password is released, if shadow passwords are installed, or for example, etc / master.passwd as in BSD -Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if for at least a built-in file system footprint (Quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable on the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change the paramount of data in KB:</seg>
