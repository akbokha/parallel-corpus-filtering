&quot; although I had attended the USA at least once a year for 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
&quot; as many of my generation I also grew up with American films , American authors have read American authors and operated by his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , which covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ed the m@@ ori@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil magn@@ ates , which were the supreme level of court with judges that wanted to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; I was it , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , I had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be that you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very sh@@ aman@@ ian love reference about his size .
then I came to Donald Tru@@ mp .
a lot has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and the racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he goes with his bott@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; he never stops behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ ino , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in Sch@@ aren for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number one was ever reached by the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ ote person asked me ?
I was able to reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people that I had seen during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist , the people from all over the world up@@ take , a deep sti@@ tious person , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s world@@ view did not agree with the Peter Bh@@ atia , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met us in our common love for basketball and we spent many hours with them to watch the Phoenix S@@ uns in the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr who fought their lives for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped us to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise Council helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and those who em@@ body through them have deep@@ ened my love of America .
&quot; during the Tru@@ mp its path to the nominated re@@ publi@@ can presidential system , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the debate with the idea that people have voted for Tru@@ mp , because they either have its racism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were prepared to overlook these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as a r@@ aci@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange man , said one of my friends , is just what we led to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superficial and respectful , and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which most know are , for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control of a country that she disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they wanted to perhaps say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who have commented on the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m . ) . : as much as the mount of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; &quot; phrase from White in An@@ no@@ ff on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what as much does the big Van Jones called , did exactly that which America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people all over the world appreciate American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have always like America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as its president , twice the son of a Kenya , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the White America that promises this promise and says : hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm . &quot;
&quot; for all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan must think the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of election . &quot;
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word @-@ change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; bro@@ o@@ ds the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ ino have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; she answered them . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; could anyone who is not as is as you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded by words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son was like , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Country , said the message . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find any place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

out of the misery to the stars : these Latin American children can not spoil their love of music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican music @-@ school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
&quot; that the music , which is played at both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby scenic ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musi@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one out of children and adults in an existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which with their musical instruments has a way to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music @-@ school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and gangs violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after an accidental meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth was so rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , says the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come and with glos@@ sy eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trump@@ ets , trumpet , trumpet , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically up on the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay capital - on instruments , which are manufactured from recovered waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments made of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for music instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to turn parts of the incident into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ as , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guit@@ ars , flute , sa@@ x@@ oph@@ ones , trumpet , trumpet , and percussion , all made of the trash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Be@@ at@@ les , by Frank Z@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local eco @-@ ologist and musician , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , to the first time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ sals and we had to teach in the same place where parents worked in the garbage . the kids loved no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one out of waste created violin .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays out on instruments from re@@ prepared material and that is called The Recycling Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance on :
the world creates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poorest , like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from garbage to music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work to fight against illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fought wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports international , practicing solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication is done as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing , before it was the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were above accordingly , and little incl@@ ined to welcome a crus@@ her of this kind to their coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they jour@@ ne@@ yed to give him one of their har@@ b@@ ors and refuse to give him a fishing appearance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ sudden was the prime minister surrounded by countries , who simply disgu@@ ised everything &quot; , &quot; re@@ members Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading lawyer of the Ken@@ yan fisheries Authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch there fish there .
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia because of pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and resources protects , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) . &quot;
the members of this network are besides Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which at that time had driven the Premier out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; in this way , we have eight countries that are equal and working together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is trapped , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to trace . thus , the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing from regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the inten@@ tional cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm , which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were imp@@ eded by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail , with the information given between individual countries , the actions are occurring today in real time , with trac@@ eable at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that you may have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move on the open seas , through satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships who fish in the botan@@ ic areas . also , so susp@@ ici@@ ally sail@@ ed routes , which suggest that a ship invites its own fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ide@@ al@@ case such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the road and possibly also , whether they have a pen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in its ports . what does the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to order pen@@ alties as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it then goes to considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal fishing catch is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , conductor director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already named platform was created to gain a valued 20 million USD to lost revenues , the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i lose every year because of the illegal fisher@@ y that penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive th@@ una fishing shops that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also these illegal fishermen .
&quot; their practices include events such as sailing under the fal@@ ster flag , counterf@@ eit roy@@ alty , indication of f@@ anta@@ sies , the fish protected species and the fish in nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you make use of the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ completely organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; formerly a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; you dar@@ ed to do my port . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal can@@ yon is trying to close the F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation F@@ ISH was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
&quot; it has revealed criminal networks , which had shared counterf@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered vessels that are used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been prosec@@ uted and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing on large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system , the F@@ ISH will help , suspected ships of precise locations . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , helps also help the illegal ships to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fisher@@ y data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
some of the ships turn on for example their automatic identification systems where they can no longer be lab@@ elled from satellites .
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it should help at the ISH , criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but then F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team from African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch has recently opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that provides satellite data , and by means of which the position of each trac@@ eable ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to the examination . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only criminal , but they also cry out . &quot;
&quot; ships that have previously without a license , and hardly expected to count with consequences , they now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in fisheries sales , since fishing boats do more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 was added , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing networks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries notic@@ ing these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we disappear several hundred million dollars every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined together for six countries such as the West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; &quot; With safety the goal is to develop even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently the most recent member of Somalia could report its first major triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the way under the wrong flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were not used for tow@@ ing networks , which is now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated to ground@@ ed waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of dimensional rules against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a particular , collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the theme of the environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is getting further to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of conquer the country &quot;
the road @-@ movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum , re@@ acted the Vene@@ tians , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into empt@@ iness by breaking down on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the back@@ bone of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also guided in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north @-@ east parliament , Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ated continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians through a acute lack of food and medicine . &quot;
many representatives of the Opposition saw the chance of fundamental change in the term of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . however , the re @-@ election of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summari@@ zes the context of the government in its latest article : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation of inflation is estimated ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine was applied to the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to join a new government . &quot;

the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

&quot; on Twitter , images that tell about disputes , as well as reports from repression and mis@@ trading . &quot;
especially large waves suggested the message about polished repression in the central @-@ northern city of Marac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and the armed supporters of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again but the protests went on .
&quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to keep police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts because you could otherwise see something many nation@@ gar@@ an@@ alysts do not have !
meanwhile a Info@@ graphic is already making the turn that forms the extent of repression per day :
so the dictatorship has suppres@@ sed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial process . this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many through the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the road .
my@@ te@@ ks Media Lab@@ s says :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ í claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fake .
here is your officers !
on the road !
&quot; other aspects of this protests as a further step in the fight against a government which has undertaken little against the dis@@ astrous economic crisis and would rather be busy to leave critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing more and more frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media they are too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or to go shopping .

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean city Córdoba . &quot;
as an adult man Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the frame of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
&quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting at the Bür@@ de , the same names as his father contribute to the brutal military vessels in prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
he held the family of 34 for the age of 34 years .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret magic .
as a child with 15 years one does not notice that it is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; I could not know at that time , that my father was a th@@ ief , the terer and the mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was g@@ end@@ im@@ pover@@ ished . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 till 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was commissioned by 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

&quot; this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of atro@@ cities over the years , who he had experienced as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has a parent company about his child , and how this child chose to have a path of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; as my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I had rounded up with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
everyone knew him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend to it .
he said :
you are a shield , you have rounded you with one from the ERP . &quot;
pass only on that they will not kidn@@ ap you one day and I then have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Labour Party in Argentina . &quot;
&quot; therefore , he offered me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would become o@@ bedient . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old , and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had caught me . &quot;
in the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Pro@@ pag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , simple everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ b@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything from it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small into a ceiling wrapped and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were disp@@ uted and enter@@ tained me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I se@@ wn up and saw a song , on the human being tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attach it to an end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that lay straight there .
&quot; she rarely finds a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ laid it with water and j@@ ed him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the skir@@ m@@ ank there was re@@ plac@@ eable ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
&quot; years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible that a person can do so much sorrow ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people with the face down@@ ward - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance aw@@ k@@ alled people still on the mattresses .
&quot; when my father said that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ id@@ est thou so , Ar@@ c@@ eps ? &quot;
I denied &quot; Why have you otherwise brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father spoke at home .
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were known as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero made a man there and red@@ dish .
&quot; ( according to information of survivors the civil is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged at La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former folklore chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way , on which you come here , is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped here came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War &apos;
my father brought all things of stolen things with a home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ dness &quot; - how they knew it - was .
&quot; but when I was later myself with the military - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - was clear to me that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military sign , which one sees one enemy that one fought . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ ckers , then it is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , at this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do it .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , and you that thou sti@@ cker cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , struck me and cried , &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and embrace you . &quot;
&quot; for this , we need no one another ! &quot;
so my Father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process I showed a photo of back then , on which I took a jacket and a rolling pul@@ ch@@ lover made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence , a compassion against this crime was to be . I saw no problem , they can put me a burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to testify .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ able act
&quot; now , where I am older , I find repentance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
you develop and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ hal@@ ted me during the dictatorship of the people . but why the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children lead ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been possible to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their corp@@ ses disappear ?
had these people not also had families to pass their mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the sharpen@@ ing of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ ous act that you can do a man .
&quot; my father told me that democracy was re@@ introduced again , they fet@@ ched machinery to eliminate the mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were broken and somewhere else - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but something naturally remains always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my Father .
&quot; the thought , to view my father was created during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience it because of all the atro@@ cities .
&quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt internally and asked me , what the whole tri@@ vial patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they were supposedly defended , actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child .
&quot; he only contradic@@ ted &quot; &quot; Na then &quot; &quot; then . &quot;
exactly what did I do .
2010 Call for the first ad .
I had finally recognized that he was a criminal .
&quot; no one can throw me , that I have been taken . I finally said against my own Father . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing before the end of the process .
&quot; he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 criminal off@@ ences : including severe , non @-@ legal imprisonment in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 years of age . &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the span@@ ish on the size of the judgment .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a trial concluded between March 1975 and December 1978 crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty for crimes against humanity . the Court moved in 28 cases for life @-@ length , and in nine cases pen@@ alties between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were free warning . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the process .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by ministers . # Es@@ war@@ dness . &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were the military members of the military , including former military members , former police and civil workers . &quot;
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he set the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by im@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have been working for the victims for years .

&quot; translation errors makes elderly people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; fear@@ less drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto in which one can extend its leader .
the photo was spread in social media .
elabor@@ ation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese City of Kyoto , customers have become a newly opened center in which one can extend his guide , last month witnesses a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word has been created . &quot; ( Cor@@ ei@@ below sha ) , &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; , &quot; but perhaps also with mal@@ ign@@ ant but@@ cher &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was available from 1 to 20 September to electronic ads in the input field and in the building itself .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine that was often shared into the social media .
&quot; the error was to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ otos . he was also to draw attention to the local time . &quot;
the Kyoto Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n in Kyoto wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation has first been removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the good &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of Pre@@ fecture , Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been tested by the translator and that the translation has not been tested on its accuracy before being published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; I sincerely sorry that older people felt through the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ Cast News made a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; scary &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; was approached as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , the country far are involved in accidents , but quite a cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto for example , in the year 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of total 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , seniors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 has caused a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of caused by the elderly in the same period has risen . &quot;
&quot; specifically called re@@ por@@ ters brought in the published version of the article comments to light , which show which pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparently stands out against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors was given the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; scary drivers &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; So is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I do not find that a real translation error is .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is spread in all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and in Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true discovery for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to transfer , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and transfer active language skills to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in case of native language . in general , the conviction that translators is in the target language - not in the source language - native language . &quot;
thus a French native speaker should translate from English to French - not from French into English .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lacking understanding of the survival , cost grounds or the relatively low number of English speakers to learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies who have not made their own foreign employees , nevertheless , translations are nevertheless company @-@ internal . then , the Japanese staff , whose English skills are considered to be the best , no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good . &quot;
photo of Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the s@@ worn and pu@@ zz@@ ling propositions are created , which can be created by machine translation , that this technology can still no longer be replaced by human translators . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English formulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often t T @-@ shirts or pockets , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood nothing . &quot;
photo of Flickr @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . but by large companies or by the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Kyoto hopefully use a serious source for their translation in the future .
Venezuela : protests and ens@@ ored activities on the internet and television take
&quot; main page of the portal Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad ( Free Surf ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , the Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users , that they have no access to the Online Sender Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet presentations from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV is also no longer available . &quot;
other online radio broad@@ cast@@ ed recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas who were organized by op@@ position@@ ists who resist@@ ed the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro@@ s .
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is linked , and recommended to the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are re @-@ locked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the veneers with Internet access especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 during the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission would like to report from them with funds and lock@@ ers when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than two liters of Lim@@ on@@ ade purchase .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ in@@ filtr@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is un@@ accessible , but also two other on @-@ line transm@@ itters . this also concerns the website , which the National Assembly transm@@ its their meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier resear@@ ches of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , we had that the local internet provider to stay DNS BE . this is a technique which can respond to the DNS server requests of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server is incorrect or denied the request at the call of such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ eventh oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission on Thursday , April 6 , set , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who took live the protests in Car@@ acas live , in custody . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to the show .
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections : so that the veneers for access to m@@ ultim@@ edi@@ al reporting about the current events in the country is always difficult . &quot;
in Paraguay many girls get to sk@@ inn@@ ate to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects witness testimonies of other Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , who were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo of Cecilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of Kur@@ dish .
&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Kur@@ dish , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which she did not work together with the family who lived there . &quot;
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; the , from which has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , the more than 4@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money sur@@ passes their min@@ der@@ ous son or her min@@ der@@ ous daughter to another , plentiful family . in exchange the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children have to do so countless days of household work , who will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a treaty which cannot be up@@ lift . &quot;
this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go field is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous ail@@ ments of human rights organizations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization dedicated to the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witness , researched and p@@ ran@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , will not be silent in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in faith that they can complete their training to improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; something out of itself &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who occupies himself and justify its exploitation with faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ving . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ leading , his family will experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they even experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 the hitherto relatively un@@ known phenomenon , which takes place in hiding in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an house , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came into hospital , her body showed traces of violent stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military bri@@ ber@@ y Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as officials in the residents .
&quot; Mar@@ ín was living in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira suggested as long as with a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society in the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest to protest and demanded that there are no other Carolina &apos; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows than children are registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded a fast investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be pointing out - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is going to be in court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are not only exploited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the farmers worked in which her father had to register , and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to go all of them , and began to buy sweets on the street or on the market sweets to earn money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta into the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood at 5 pm every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , they puri@@ fied the fridge , p@@ ate the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ per@@ fied the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner they finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she had never had to hunger , but did not get any un@@ bound@@ ed food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the refrigerator , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was the power of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings the hous@@ eholder Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him stand and guidance from op@@ position@@ ings as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he tried to convince them , to convince the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ator no faith . &quot;
&quot; he held it for intelligent , but did not remain with her . &quot; &quot; the host had someone found someone who heard , while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t allowed me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would get there again &quot; bad habits , &quot; that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of the Re@@ í , would be back home their native cons@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the education , which they had made it to lose , she explains . &quot;
&quot; it was completely clear , however , that they had been paid for everything they had paid by them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a dis@@ crime was also discri@@ minated in the school . &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken are Mob@@ bing and the Shi@@ ps that Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children parents have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of any group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society approved the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job vac@@ ant for cleaning personnel and n@@ anny in Paraguay .
&quot; the Administration in the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town@@ ship in the district of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;

law rep@@ lied the Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to &quot; the regulations regarding the use and usability of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when he is accepted by the Parliament , user @-@ makers must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up in order to give citizens a permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , commercial users and users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and recruitment numbers in order to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is dre@@ amed of doing this , that could bring a sentence of up to six months in prison or an ATM . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fen and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice , video reports and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should register the user &apos;s users and users who do not register , given the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul saddle , parliamentary member and promot@@ er of the Legislative Council , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user @-@ users and users received a username and password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall to get the Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this might mean that Egypt is planning to judge a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to which , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not known that such plans exist . &quot;
experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egypt &apos;s initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I have to doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things , which have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , they think that just as they could be violent on physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take it seriously , then it means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who claim a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure of parliament and constitutional committees , before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance or enforcement is successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no devi@@ ating fo@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MPs of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ w@@ y proposed a legislative framework against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long imprisonment for those who were prepared for those who ple@@ aded &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards that runs through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ y , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they are always less prey , at risk . &quot;
why is this particular kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining car@@ ni@@ vor@@ y in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem , and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ ory exists . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually is in the free hunting ground , is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a big cat at the camera , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 documented , which was achieved for the northeast Japan &apos;s daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the advances made in the last six years have been affected by the &quot; &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; &quot; of March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture , was a real pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring former Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evac@@ u@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had to disappear whole coastal cities off the map .
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima lived as a nuclear accident , already alone that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows out which progress six years after the progress has been reached in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ constructions as well as survey outcomes of those affected .
&quot; housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( el@@ ong@@ ated , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts finished . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms the final light with 70 percent of such houses . &quot;
&quot; at the same time still , six years after the disaster , evac@@ u@@ ated of containers , the evac@@ u@@ ated accommodation has been re@@ char@@ geable , in the Kaz@@ ak@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
after the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people saw forced to live in Beh@@ el@@ k accommodation .
&quot; in December 2016 there are still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of 2011 evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more than 75 percent of the evac@@ uation , which after disaster has been settled in Beh@@ el@@ k accommodation , have been in final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the status of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung has been able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the evil , their p@@ for@@ es until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fisher@@ y st@@ oves in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now again in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y was re @-@ added to its operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved to the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agr@@ arian wholesale . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear incident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares have been destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures the tourism has recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far back . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent at the same stand , as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to feel their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the native population and among the evac@@ u@@ ated by them . she asked her about the status of re@@ building and also how their feeling is changed opposite the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in their introduction of the article Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o introduced a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population in their experience .
&quot; the ques@@ tioning that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have been taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es @-@ prevention has not been done . &quot;
how it is about those who had to evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its issue the anniversary of the earthquake the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced its attention also to the situation of evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the huge earthqu@@ akes and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , dis@@ astrous , nuclear accident , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people came back home to Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; after the stand of 2017 there are still 40 000 citizens of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ine areas , most of the evac@@ u@@ ated areas are more than 50 years old . they have to be rec@@ eded in right Beh@@ ind , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people encounter people from other countries , who speak a different language , the differences appear to be bigger than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , bro@@ aden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over voice and countries . &quot;
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ voy talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ ar@@ asa talks about how love for music has consolidated the lack of joint language skills during a trip in rural China ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she has collected people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday he had be@@ aten him a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide participated in millions of demonstr@@ ators in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva Tarok studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain @-@ trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him this Saturday and have put it into an artificial coma .
his state is regarded as critical .
the local portrait Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which are rapidly spread within a few days .
&quot; in the pictures it is also the face of the police officers , which was identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state Go@@ i@@ ás announced that Samp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until completion of the investigation into the incident of an active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his drummer on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police officers was op@@ ed by a prot@@ esters and in the intensive care centre , his face would see six months in television and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed the video of Lu@@ iz da Luz in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several sanitary briefly on it . &quot;
another video with the same scenes but from another perspective is also filmed on social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of state , internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me has been murdered by his father , because he had attacked the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have attacked the very sad case by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who was attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has struck him with a stroke . &quot;
police handles
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only State in Brazil in which it came to brutal police in the past Friday .
&quot; police officers put in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber @-@ fin and Tr@@ as@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the S &amp; D MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , the police asked to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media is mis@@ understood by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ ag@@ onists : a window @-@ wheel . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported in a targeted manner over a cr@@ atic glass window to shape their front pages illustr@@ ative .
&quot; by contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a fire on a fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken shut@@ down than about the protests of thousands , serving the defense of a special cause . &quot;
this must also recognise if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; here also the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportionate significance , and the typical non @-@ violence of military police are dec@@ eived by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on the fron@@ t@@ ational course with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso closed nearly hundreds of su@@ gar@@ be@@ et factories all over Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the People &apos;s Church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the Western province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as a el Central - in Spanish sugar cane - regardless of what there is no n@@ enn@@ ing sugar crop on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the gar@@ be@@ et factories .
&quot; after receiving the sugar cane industry in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ mage made of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 2@@ 72 workers had to find themselves new .
some have rarely the work .
&quot; other res@@ iz@@ ations and comm@@ uting a day to the factories , which can be ma@@ hlen . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which stands every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry is not inherited his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the su@@ gar@@ be@@ et factories , who are again in operation in the east of the region , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene recalls exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would get the sugar cane plant , but the promise has not been kept . &quot;
&quot; the be@@ et industry resist@@ ed the pl@@ ag@@ ues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effici@@ encies , the bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amoun@@ ted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a mot@@ if for the country a few decades ago , but the bad inherit@@ ances have already been no news . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar industry switched off ?
the old railway sti@@ g of the church looked at a better time .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane fabri@@ cation were technically obsol@@ ete , and barely competitive , they were viable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories , the annual production goals amoun@@ ted to 4 million tons . &quot;
&quot; they just left factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) . &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the zo@@ diac in the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar rate increased again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of in@@ geni@@ ous sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os will remain per pound , according to the 2016 published report &quot; &quot; Agricultural Spec@@ trum &quot; &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Economic and Food Organization . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the resource export @-@ export amounts to around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day with certainty into the history , the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro was published during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from that time the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
&quot; in the following years , the stand@@ still from a total of 98 sugar mills , more than 65 million people got their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar ro@@ hr@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich am 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene is known as a soldier , about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
&quot; thus the place is received , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; this was officially written documents , which would only be removed with respect to the parts which would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could leave any acceptance . &quot;
from there the responsibility was over and the letters were more and more common .
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the silent factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved against his will at the down@@ time of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he remote , he den@@ o@@ unced one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area between Cuba and the most important job creation has been eliminated .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for the work place and services were generated , which generated the plants in the congregations in which they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the present people , when he did not guarantee that for the areas whose factories have been no longer in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of the sugar tubes
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by M@@ ind .

&quot; after two years the People &apos;s parish came to Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the sugar cane plant closed , or better said than they began to dis@@ connect them , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ low , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
they were to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people left the region . &quot;
a food factory was created in the area whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new system are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;

&quot; young Nations communities in all of Canada deal with themes that are important to them . they do this by Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , since 2014 the workshop of mobile audio studios go directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
the original workshops were headed by the Ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree @-@ communities and then working together with the C@@ ree Hi@@ p @-@ Hop Group The North@@ stars .
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in discussions topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ suffici@@ ency , or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &quot; Na &quot; Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ chen@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , the history of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , in which almost two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
&quot; the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to convey , how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences by globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs were published in Indi@@ genous languages , although the young people of the First Nations are not always master @-@ speaking . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation is sung , the refrain is sung in C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is at your disposal , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like I was not ever interested in me .
but I am trying to go on earth to go on earth
that is the day when you want to take our cry
because we have lost our way of life as a youth
but I believe that we will raise ourselves one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and look forward to our youth
this is how they can do what they have determined the creator .

plastic dishes are not only shown in Japan
plastic dishes ( ms ) out of a typical restaurants in Japan .

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers , what is exactly on the menu , will be displayed near the entrance sho@@ ch@@ away from each food , which is served at this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that produce even those plastic dishes that the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a was documented over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes usually are so common that they do not even exceed them . however , a new trend is turning into eye @-@ cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ ch@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic @-@ tra@@ ded mobile @-@ rib@@ b@@ ons , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ y @-@ objects , as in this case , cooling @-@ rank@@ shaft : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ al cool@@ ers for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ ti@@ ff will become more and more complex .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) turned into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile phone .
we have also produced this part for the exhibition at Tokyo .
and here is an apple that gives your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to watch out like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile phone @-@ stands and mobile designer allow you to make your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon are used , a popular place that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can che@@ ated my mobile phone with laughter . &quot;
I think I will be the one .
this interest in plastic geri@@ es can also take a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our newest mobile phone @-@ str@@ uts has the shape of mel@@ mel@@ on ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ rile plastic dishes can be seen below : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # . &quot;
&quot; if you like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the borough of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the re@@ tired of the restaurant industry . such as with the sho@@ ots @-@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , the mer@@ ging and che@@ ers regularly put on statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy , which this struggle takes place . &quot;
&quot; the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent attack , someone looks at the dream or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; there are behind every body , behind each bone in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never heal . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican message portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug hol@@ es@@ ale life &quot; &quot; ) to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories of people working in the struggle between enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if business close , because they are threatened by drug hands and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video called &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who married every weekend gra@@ ves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost only one day their father , her four brothers and sisters , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again to the task of trying to get rid of , and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are in charge of the insurance of my father , but it does not get paid , because that demand a mort@@ als . &quot;
where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the br@@ ittle and the government . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excerpts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that we should never consider violence as normal , regardless of what type it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with illness and sensation of journalism I have been known for some years now .
&quot; I come by a newspaper of newspaper every day , and see the front pages with pictures , which actually only came from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from actors of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the one , the raised or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ year cous@@ in thinks that he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders , when they pass through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , that is , as if they were those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they may have something like that . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the Tat@@ en@@ nia of men is incredibly for me if the death of six people and the p@@ aving of 43 students in a neighboring village are therefore justified that they were located .
&quot; I think they try to talk , that they are spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ red and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post of &quot; four months of black@@ mail in main city distri@@ butions : like a family with threats , until they were destroyed by their business until they were not only destroyed the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never ends , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed and telephone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed , the better . &quot;
it included its report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they de@@ duce or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether crying my deep @-@ rooted feelings would be dis@@ solving , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how you are crying . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence opened . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was assass@@ inated by organised crime ?
how about it in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
Br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make a egg coo@@ ks , tor@@ tillas warm and &apos; Chi@@ chi &apos; for the babies makes those with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vial of water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been over two years ago , when he had only a couple of blocks away from his home , the bloody corp@@ se of his father had been shot by armed men out of a passing car . &quot;
when Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as an violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of the Mor@@ ality according to the public safety and government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ utor of 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8,@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundred thousand stories that organised organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
just a few stories live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those that we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 was launched in 2015 , the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trade which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades . &quot;

&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this entry and the pages to which he links , contain images , on which authority is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or or fal@@ si@@ fication a for@@ gery .
&quot; but how is the years after the first time has appeared ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident at seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication it was mis@@ leading , used , trage@@ dies which actually have occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there are abundant careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 there crossed a pet@@ rol truck the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . there came 230 people in life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became too dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
tragic coinci@@ ded with the filling of the pet@@ rol station to the victim .
&quot; pap@@ er@@ Represent@@ atives described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ ant homes covered including a cinem@@ as in the vicinity , which was full of people who see the soccer world championship . &quot;
houses f@@ aded and disgu@@ ised corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users My@@ s@@ tical Mon@@ key , 12 . January 2015.@@ Mehr@@ ere photos of the incident make the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it displays rows of shor@@ tw@@ ined body that can be heated on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not with it in the context of related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am attacked the Nig@@ erian villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ye@@ witnesses reported dramatically from atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and stores were burned down and corp@@ ses were burned in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count the corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a citizen on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were sm@@ ashed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite pictures the following period could be displayed .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved but the army prot@@ ector in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image from the DR Congo again emerged as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2.000 people took place two days in Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this abuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ descriptions ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was taken as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
&quot; another step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media related to arguments . &quot;
the picture from San@@ ge joined in combination with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who could flee to pun@@ ches , rape and several deaths , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following on which these descriptions were gathered together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from a su@@ di @-@ Arab message page , which , in 2012 , the President of mar@@ s Th@@ ein being told , monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from the DR Congo to give this information . &quot;
&quot; the original fee , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , which AF@@ P did as their source also , they also had to be attributed to this statement , but did not have the picture taken out of the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cross @-@ ups will be back up to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; converted picture search &quot; , &quot; you can see how far the borders can exceed . &quot;
&quot; a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine ink Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images found , which are very similar to the present picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they originate from a mixing mas@@ on private pages , platforms of social media and Community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed false reports and have tried others to dis@@ appointments the for@@ geri@@ es .
&quot; we have used examples of abu@@ sive usage and associated with the respective countries , based on which side they were published . therefore , we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which were also associated with each other ) , several examples may be used for abu@@ sive use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be fully donated ( on the map in orange ) :

examples of countries for incorrect cou@@ pl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ ted countries point out on pages or servers that are still available via the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ cons .
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ y are examples , according to the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; memory , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodox community clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims , Christians kill . &quot;
&quot; Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page was argu@@ ed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein being vac@@ ated , that monks and politician had been involved in the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim and brought together the story with the image of San@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; the article has been updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the picture continues to be included . &quot;
Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about Stu@@ dents , who were killed by the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , published by the Catholic close news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture was not derived from the kill@@ ings but it claims that it has a &quot; similar de@@ pot attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ acre of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am from 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there would be links to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ok@@ y@@ or@@ fer@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo emerged , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and extingu@@ ished a discussion under Muslims following the mass@@ acre of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events , the mut@@ ine@@ ous in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was printed as proof of the mass@@ acre of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ ched ) . but the messages that were associated with it were taken up in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the goal was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message which was alleged to have been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , translated it discussion boards like this here on Vietnamese and explained it to counterf@@ eit feedback . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; using other accounts , ag@@ gregation and pages in the following countries ( on the Fol@@ der in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye is also out , but are no longer completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entry with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and disp@@ ose them in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original translation of 2010 , the image may ultimately be a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( recei@@ pts ) which per@@ v@@ ade these po@@ sts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in terms of larger discussions about silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians through Muslim or - to defend Muslims - the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second F@@ ram@@ ing uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
religion understanding and value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investig@@ ating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper issue is what happens when reading these pictures cannot give any longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who have un@@ inten@@ tional share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest that mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atro@@ cities did in@@ true and nar@@ rowing it the real atro@@ city of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dissemination of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the with@@ hold of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures will even be demanded by the victims .
&quot; at the same time , concern is that violent images readers and audience des@@ ensi@@ tise and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how forced media function to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot regarding for@@ ged representations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s message reporting . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologist experim@@ entation , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will be able to thoroughly think about situation in which a picture suggests something that actually , however , can also be used from the context or completely ab@@ used type . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false supplements should also be taken into account as internationally as they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo of Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. D@@ t. uns@@ ett@@ able ) attempts to provide language barriers to a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ matched words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all resist@@ ing stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; one word or expression is not sufficient , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit context are needed to exactly understand what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have already been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ u@@ at@@ u language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h to your parents in recognition of how to make you tried in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in H@@ uns@@ q language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels , after having seen in cold days in the sun . &quot;
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they lo@@ dges other cultures , revealing other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our novel@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you affect how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site still want to publish more of these &quot; un@@ matched &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are appreciated by O@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite sw@@ ings here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka lies with the worst floo@@ d@@ disaster of the decade
the archipelago of Sri Lanka lies at the moment the worst flood and terrestrial disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which is usually at the end of May , through strong rainf@@ alls , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ ten@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the flight and mud . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) , approximately 100 000 people have been brought to a 30@@ 4 safe place of stay . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls were left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas were slowly coming back . &quot;
health and hygiene dis@@ proportion of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the scale of the floo@@ d@@ disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water objects of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lan@@ k@@ le@@ thal floods wor@@ sen the den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ le crisis , war@@ ns the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today morning , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da with G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the yesterday crowded waters of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
air Force has provided five air@@ planes for lif@@ ebo@@ ats and further five are produced for transportation of not@@ ches for those included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also explained to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tim@@ s in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood @-@ situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and lif@@ ebo@@ ats need dron@@ es for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for flood @-@ offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this field need help .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ist will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ phy Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; &quot; high water aid &quot; &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle for picking assistance and donations . these have then been re@@ directed to the s@@ lan@@ k@@ ish Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they led a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful bo@@ iling actions for floo@@ ding through high water and vom@@ iting people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kas , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , they will bring people in need and help them to help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kas is now the long way to restoring norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; used in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco , with a neigh@@ bor in and love girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my Rock in the Bran@@ ch . &quot;
in one minute we call for more slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next ple@@ tion we tend rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of rainforest and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ s@@ towel high , bound by an American flag , other sk@@ inn@@ y slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look at me and says , &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation already .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception . &quot;
they disgu@@ ise me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide . &quot;
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify to be Muslim , to different kind of art . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , which as I don &apos;t fit there , be Muslim . &quot;
det@@ ects are being inter@@ fer@@ ed
I do not walk alone .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry in America is best sold : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come one in the sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i as old as I am now he was a Orthodox mixer and schol@@ arly .
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western conception , religion was removed from Rum@@ i , as well as the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a huge part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
&quot; another is in the rec@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Muslims , the western books have been colonial already for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting picture is determined by the dark man who should be afraid and the exotic woman that you should save .
the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid broke the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images continue to stand still further today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to pursue them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen , like this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative our news@@ letters . &quot;
&quot; this fo@@ d@@ v over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that has led to nine Muslim women over the last three decades , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; this fo@@ d@@ v fails to realize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from contributing their head towel in public buildings and su@@ gar@@ s to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong fo@@ d@@ v weak@@ ened Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it looks that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil of Afri@@ cans who were told here with slave @-@ worship . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ k@@ v has occupied our collective imagination of such deep and faul@@ ty that often si@@ kh men and children become the aim of antim@@ icro@@ phones and ra@@ ils .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and on the way we tell , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only a fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the others . &quot;
1.3 billion people belonging to 1.@@ 7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry fails to grasp the scar of 1.9 billion .
and we have failed here where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree of &quot; religious group in America .
&quot; more than one third of the entire Muslim population , Afri@@ cans are African Americans . &quot;
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation that originate from 77 countries .

use is approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents came to live in New York in order to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother placed her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; sky@@ scr@@ aper were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ atics from Bangladesh by name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan had re@@ figured out the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ f@@ aded Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ f@@ aded Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
&quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ or@@ an , which all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; made out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we do not carry all hand@@ ker@@ or@@ ane with us . &quot;
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security ch@@ equ@@ es at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies on Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ led Islam@@ ist forces with banknotes , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is already incorrect image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we can tell them , Islam hos@@ tility exists in more than a foreig@@ ner , who is on a woman the head towel . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ ol@@ a , but a Mus@@ lim@@ a was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ an Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; describing social @-@ recognition religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior might not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbour , my rock in the industry that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ental ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms , and her the Arab verses to protect the Quran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
I repeat three times each of them .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

use is approved .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ernal part with her sisters ; as she was winning a contest of the art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see in that moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its finished and un@@ finished paintings , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters that can be almost in@@ agile . &quot;
to be Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers they had told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; H@@ lim@@ a is to be as she brought me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people , that - over centuries - through a &quot; &quot; empire &quot; , &quot; which was founded a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tic Ost@@ ini@@ die @-@ company , it has a deep meaning , God , my only master . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use is approved .
&quot; adherence means to grow and listen to that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my admitt@@ edly grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Hal@@ ch@@ end@@ rin , while he writes books about the modern Islam and about the independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan un@@ f@@ aded to close his family in India , who was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists were scattered , which have shared the Muslim world like at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know , that in the last two centuries Europeans are all living up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first fli@@ pping bom@@ b of history was rejected by a Muslim country in front of a century .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an intimate , k@@ ash@@ ish subj@@ ection of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; because he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he jour@@ ne@@ yed in more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of 1.9 billion people go deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ ess , our un@@ plug@@ ged history . &quot;
&quot; it means that four@@ teen years ago , it means that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that have been distributed across any continent apart from the Ant@@ arctic , who have been in Iraq to detect mass destruction of weapons that are not existed . &quot;
it means to know that more than half an hour of Iraq was buried among the ruins of war .
an American mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the su@@ icide @-@ rate among veter@@ ans since 2001 increased by more than 32 percent .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy carries out the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story will be reported four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years of the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slaves . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago , a African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country . &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth that I felt , when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we are saying black life .
&quot; a Americans to be a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Mus@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a mus@@ lim@@ a and a journalist , the in@@ dur@@ al inter@@ c@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple ties , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion holds more possibilities than a magi@@ cian , but it is represented in the reduced branches of &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; against &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother , to care for my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people are established on this branches of structural Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ ism consists of the Muslim Brotherhood , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immigration , which is a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it consists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from the countries , which are bombar@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ fly @-@ list , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; these are the wars that we lead and bom@@ bs , which we throw at Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and on the basis of those who we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically un@@ correct image and beg@@ s it to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the s@@ ligh@@ test score .
the constell@@ ations we have to guide
we are too deep dar@@ ed to un@@ cover the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous imaging prints that we have in our news editorial offices .
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which is trying to capture our many ties with bond identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; Pod@@ cast See , S@@ ay , of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the vir@@ cast # Goo@@ d@@ Mus@@ lim@@ h Muslim ; the vir@@ cast # Goo@@ d@@ Mus@@ lim@@ h Muslim ; the viral video on Re@@ ads , an initiative , more Muslim authors and MS Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , muscular , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

coll@@ age of the author .
&quot; but I am concerned because of this difficult global time , in which we are . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.@@ 7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason that conspir@@ atorial theore@@ ti@@ cians who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ entially because they have made Muslim to others .
there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially as it has created the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate major territories in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am worried about the realities and the story , which I was not aware of how I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me a bit s@@ inu@@ ous Mus@@ lim@@ a . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread@@ cru@@ m@@ track in my speech .
&quot; things that might ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the inter@@ c@@ tions that constitutes our humanity , like a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Kon@@ ens@@ ations will take place within the framework of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools or which we read in our newspapers . &quot;
poster of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why don &apos;t I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where yet Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people challenged by the work of &quot; others &quot; in public idea , four decades ago by the Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uns@@ afe questions after the role of being aware and consciously the &quot; others &quot; have done , because the employment we have had a new future , in which we have no president , while he had already broken countries and &quot; to others &quot; &quot; people bombar@@ ded , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ ator wants to preserve urban areas
&quot; stor@@ yt@@ ellers , by Flickr @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be an opportunity to connect here and now despite a language barrier with someone ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the creator of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently over another initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written form , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the creators of the project apply :
&quot; the mass die of the languages of the world can be avoided if we are cities to assume diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants are not forgotten , who they are to include . &quot;
&quot; while listening to often associated with it , &quot; &quot; do these events instead &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story first in their own language and then translate them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and their representation are that the audi@@ tors can turn on it . &quot;
they call laughter and emotions when the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ates takes also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of nar@@ ration . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the Fa@@ bel from the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after having declared the significance of his Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to an audience speaking that your language does not understand ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have heard !
you were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling in three cities have taken place and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project , can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers . &quot;
Puerto Rico demands from the US re@@ unification of the sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a new exam of the public debt of Puerto Rico , who participated in 72 million US dollars on the last 3 of April 2017 with various religious and civil organizations in a mass demonstration , the march of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ cin@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( civil Front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and of the Ec@@ ological Church Assembly Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ ession of the revival of debts also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os calls for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts to be held accountable for their corrupt . &quot;
&quot; we call for financial testing and a mission committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions of appropriate remun@@ eration , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we will pres@@ et and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be deduc@@ ted with decl@@ ining retirement payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the State of the integrated territory of the USA - suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a government @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization without Party @-@ profit organisation with focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility before , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a broad restruc@@ ture of state infrastructure .
&quot; from the outside , measures imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizens are falling away from the people to be rejected . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist des in France , based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publisher of the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ dies ( The cost of freedom : a collective night research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available here roy@@ alty , contains a number of papers that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge , and what the real costs are associated with . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , designers , researchers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have side to side to look through the fog , which surrounds our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the list of the A@@ dra @-@ Pen@@ ding in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have since then no information about his current state or location .
the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ates , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we today here ?
what do we have chosen ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in detention authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown site . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of military arbitration from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported it to be contacted by individuals on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them into knowledge by an alleged death penalty . &quot;
but his place of stay and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a Designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el founded , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes were fores@@ een as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the elimination of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture @-@ types with hi@@ es@@ y traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything in mind , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip move into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a period of time , which will be of in@@ valuable importance to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; however , this project could not yet complete this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my whole life for dre@@ aming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English at even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he always has shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el has opened me the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he has also brought others det@@ ain@@ ees , as they use computers , at least theoretically , without they actually stopped one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a promot@@ er , which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; she du@@ ck the lyrics to him , when they visited him and he over@@ threw them from the Arabic in English . &quot;
the book is free of licence @-@ free .
accoun@@ t@@ ant of Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it is happening with every visit
that I missed in the world of your charming eyes
&quot; that I lose the mind , in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that for me any of the dangers are no matter , &quot;
&quot; everyone of the f@@ ences , bond@@ men and gu@@ ardians &quot;
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I rings in every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion for me
if your eyes will say Le@@ ad
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I welcome quickly to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to get back all the moments
and over your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el wrote G@@ haz@@ i :
&quot; a year goes , my soul &quot;
while in
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ eball History is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime of Bashar @-@ Assad , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested , or were disappeared under non @-@ violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in custody . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our call in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption condemned Director after release and returned to previous post
Moz@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted with anger on a corrupt fall in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in the state apparatus he was committed against corruption .
&quot; this is a Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants . &quot;
money from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately asked his re@@ setting into the company what happened on 19th April .
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Assembly of the Republic , which made the request , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , since the company was not de@@ filed after his custody . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not too good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ blica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution responsible for public transparency , condemned in an interview with the German wave the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption , and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company would have to initiate a discipl@@ in@@ age process against the conflic@@ ting resistance .
the firm apparently apparently and prompted no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , reject this behavior also and regards the case as a &quot; resistance &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and took half of them apart . &quot;
&quot; he could be paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he might be advised and his image pres@@ et . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has granted us to re@@ integrate into the company that he saved harm . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
resistance !
&quot; Bit@@ phones Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ que and Student of Political Science in Brazil says that the director had no morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded from the state , because he re@@ acted it , I cannot believe that someone has rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already honoured . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead he only served themselves in the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state , as hand@@ ele it has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself is tired , pr@@ un@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is one of the prison : &quot;
&quot; di@@ ers belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , will remain the Moz@@ ambi@@ que not only for ever as first independent president , but also as a sharp , c@@ utter and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , as he energetic confirmed that &quot; a ambitious man is capable of all , also the father@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest , for sale . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man is changing , my experience shows that it is not that way . he does not change the tac@@ tic , but he does not address his ambition . &quot;
an ambitious man is criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also visible :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat down 10 years and came free .

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and ens@@ ored many users to injustice
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means box her@@ edi@@ tary or spherical .

&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their Po@@ sts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of Indian origin , or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; , &quot; ( in bur@@ ial script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radic@@ alist movements of the word has given an extremely tight con@@ notation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight , hate speech in Myanmar , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on his platform . &quot;
Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ Kal@@ ar may normally be associated with racism but the word itself does not call itself automatically .
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed for his use . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos; cal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ read@@ ed ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ y A@@ ung Ka@@ ung explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was er@@ ased today because he enth@@ used the word of Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they knew how he could rel@@ ieve his back pain by doing a word . &quot;
&quot; the set ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the fra@@ gment ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ically - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; in Win H@@ am is the opinion that she may reduce vis@@ as , radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical , before it all po@@ sts to spread racism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it is fil@@ tered the Word automatically .
automatic dis@@ m is not understood what you write to Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the words . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; &quot; ( sp@@ read@@ out ) . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that this tri@@ ck@@ ery nation@@ alists spread , the hate speech , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ised its nation@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often start a K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the zen@@ ly word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook started to delete his post@@ ings , when he wanted to communicate his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail from Facebook was removed and sent to me the light , post and parts of contents for 24 hours because the post &quot; Facebook community has not been kidn@@ apped . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Po@@ sts of people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against hate @-@ hate fac@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ical Internet Community ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
to c@@ ensor such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they started with no local context or technical support and have forbidden words such as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to report the fal@@ si@@ bly dissolved Po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they have had a great turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship offered a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make himself using Facebook funny and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posting will be taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which have no hate speech , but still removed : &quot;

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch inheritance curr@@ y and watch a Indian movie .
&quot; just to try out whether Facebook contains the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; the post is hun@@ ted &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal then people ? &quot;

&quot; in the last five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists are to have used social networks to bro@@ aden their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks to heat the violence in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts were forced to escape . &quot;
Facebook became to be critic@@ ised for his failure to critici@@ ze the washed @-@ hate @-@ hate on his Bur@@ m@@ ical pages under control .
&quot; but rather than simply to c@@ ensor the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better focused on context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Tr@@ ini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the children &apos;s escape
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s escape is in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now illegal .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country of the country unanim@@ ously decided to unanim@@ ously decided to offer this practice , which is to offer this practice so that the most profitable age is 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of marriage held some members of du@@ b@@ ular and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leaders of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state is not to mix up , since that , age not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors , each person under 18 years of age . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children that had already been married with 15 , in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 there were 8.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online @-@ pe@@ tions and social @-@ media movements , which stri@@ ves to create laws to nur@@ ture , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hind@@ u leader , e.g. had no concerns , the critics of the children &apos;s before they should , dar@@ n &apos;t take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition sort of tension in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point no doubt whether the opposition would agree with the law of law . &quot;
&quot; but in early 2017 , the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one could be discussed , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree and proc@@ laim the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which re@@ counts the read@@ lie @-@ Ann bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against children &apos;s h@@ ehe was agreed in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
&quot; having decided previously in the Senate , the draft can now be made to the law . &quot;
the majority of social media users was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws for children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who suffered a prime minister in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; there has been too much time and unnecessary smell , which has s@@ lei@@ gh the core of the thing , but know what ? the children &apos;s before is in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now illegal , and that is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson the opinion was , it definitely took long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas overwhel@@ med that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update to Facebook from Lara Qu@@ entr@@ en@@ - Thomas , which says : , Her@@ vor@@ ous news ! &quot;
the marriage law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 about it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , &quot;
the most profitable age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious and 18 years .
&quot; the draft to change the marriage law was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members and there were 35 members of the vote . &quot;
&quot; all members , who were against , have voted for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s escape is not allowed in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago by law .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ files .

&quot; yet a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ at@@ an Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the best known Hind@@ u Organization . &quot;
&quot; months Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to take the judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promises . &quot;
&quot; during the general prosec@@ utor to Paris Al ra@@ wi , a fi@@ ery of the law , said , unless Mahar@@ aj wants to go against the law , the most social media users , the debate would go differently to the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
&quot; dear Sat if we , instead of going to hold the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that only panic and discomfort might think that the state , our daughters , that they may be of large , hard @-@ minded men who are likely to be mis@@ used to carry the discussion further ? &quot;
or do you think that it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s to@@ e in different gra@@ dations are legal or continuing the standard , although there are laws that they fail . &quot;

&quot; through the mirrors of web pages , Turkish users can view back on Wikipedia content . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright laws in the USA , internationally . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; since more than one month , Turkey un@@ ra@@ vels the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day for day will be more evident , how important the platform for users is to find helpful as well as reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV series are against blocking .
&quot; although many techniques are used to use it used to use transformations for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN @-@ prevalence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has existed since 2008 article from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been adopted regularly after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the two most famous country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked locked , there are now several mirrors pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform created all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
the content is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we took everything to place s@@ napshots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alised and shared way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if you cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ a.@@ org . &quot;
IP@@ FS also included that this step is independently carried out by the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation and it is only about screen@@ shots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ti@@ si@@ p@@ clo@@ pedi@@ .org , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar b@@ other pages if in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and co @-@ workers at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks :
&quot; there is no complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror . &quot;
one can acc@@ esses another URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server manages the request for the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .

at that time he was a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar has endeav@@ ored to bring about Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ as wildlife to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his home place right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that guide the attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook as he helps him this first @-@ class situation with his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I rested right at home as myself suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side , where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately began to kne@@ eling pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so scary as they look like .
and he should know it because he was the tiger already from coun@@ ten@@ ance to face :
a tiger can not distur@@ b from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; even I was at home due to the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the be@@ k appeared . he immediately sets up , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ ali nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent , in order to make in Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az and was originally written on Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was again published here as part of a content sharing Convention .
&quot; in many parts of India they avoid women with the greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pr@@ on@@ oun or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should respect the norm , this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a spot@@ light , and exp@@ elled by her family and the village community , after she had addressed a married name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also do not call upon the name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer access to fear , if at all , they should not come to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were quickly became the main topic of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which there are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is operated by the community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the dismantling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the detection of practices , such as children &apos;s residence to the ban@@ ishment of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
she tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and they have made them at the same time amb@@ ass@@ adors of the change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , was women who did not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided to have chosen this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify with .
&quot; according to their hus@@ bands , the name of her hus@@ bands did not speak out loud , is a man who ple@@ aded all the liability and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman is respected her husband and wish him long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is considered to be back as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot;
tradition is rooted as deeply rooted that we never have thought about this discussion to this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to have never called by the name to her husband , to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini is told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still l@@ ull for a long time after the video was end .
&quot; intern@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage in Roh@@ ini with their first disc@@ us@@ sion@@ b .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then asked them all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women never to speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini is told :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during all the exercise , it was just before moving , a different decided to dism@@ iss the whole an@@ ed frustration against him and his family by hiding him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adrenal@@ ine rush about it , with an ancient Br@@ other broken , the females decided that they would actually attempt at home their hus@@ bands in the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put the women into the head : his wife could not stop his name .
a different club member chose to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law they provo@@ ke , she was afraid and said that there was an error . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less intel@@ li@@ gible and the situation of art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports as women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cast@@ or red spot on the forehead , which indicates the spouse : &quot;
why do women only show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ red spot if he was doing it . &quot;
he laughs and I heard him to bear him .
&quot; the other women have not stopped entirely , but my , they are now in a better position , even to choose him in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip for every discussion . &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make the women take care of who could hear , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; during the last months she celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes , they d@@ anced and che@@ eks and spoke about things that they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have known about some things , for example as our identi@@ ties at our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have borne by their marriage only Sar@@ is .
&quot; for most people it was okay , but some wanted to have a Sal@@ was @-@ Kur@@ ta , a broad shirt over a p@@ ants ; they do not have dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of your own clothes @-@ choice , mor@@ als connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , jewellery du@@ ini their own pair of cur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ inhi@@ bit ) into a discussion round , so the women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is safe to make it happen . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion was changed , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming to roles : &quot;
we have only made little steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then heard again to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and are not other members of the family . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now contribute to each time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
&quot; the women in the disc@@ ol@@ ding lu@@ b know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the catch of more freedom of movement or your own clos@@ ets - at the end of a hard to navig@@ ating river . &quot;
by giving each other self confidence will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am there too .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home and told other people about what we talk about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of smooth persons for the organization , probably for aber@@ ration purposes , disturbing the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practitioners . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men in the district of Mil@@ ange were killed , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and some of the organs were taken .
&quot; two men have been arrested , and in the episode they confess that the organs of sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used . &quot;
&quot; it will give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a glu@@ ed man could bring gold , or wealth , explained the police of the Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on glu@@ ed men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is the purpose of assass@@ ination for prevailing purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to investigate the UN in the South African country to examine this intern@@ ist .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country Tanzania , where the government campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
&quot; he warned those who are going to go into the land , &quot;

&quot; the persecution and assass@@ ination of gl@@ utt@@ led individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has presum@@ ed cultural motives and is considered by the traditional sh@@ am@@ ans into account ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims would have power , the wealth generated . &quot;
in the last few days three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Saman@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , the pointed out that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty , Moz@@ ambi@@ que faces : &quot;
&quot; I would like to take E@@ IN Moz@@ ambi@@ que , TH@@ AT A country where people would have ashamed to go on the road and others would not hurt or even their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os still k@@ ah@@ le or gl@@ oss of member for aber@@ ration purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; have to be hun@@ ted to get to their own wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seriousness of the phenomenon , some have had the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren humor . &quot;

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprison@@ ed Chinese Dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community , after his attack was announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( debt level ) after it was involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to which was involved in the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Li@@ us as &quot; an internal matter and tell a speaker , he said it as &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to call up calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ ine Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or give him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ red . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met in late June Chinese official to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker has rejected it , however , to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow li@@ u abroad for treatment . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister of B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ing have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to the shock , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government rus@@ hed that ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon to China as the exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
&quot; after the news was dissemin@@ ated that Li@@ u was seriously suffering , the Nobel Committee gave his hope for unconditional release as an expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
due to his detention he was not able to counter@@ increase its price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6th , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on which China was called to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately of house arrest and permit him to seek medical assistance where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ ats of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for the release of Li@@ us for the release of Li@@ us on how to put it in an explanation on June 30th : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect that China lifts all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they will meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , so that he may help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; speaker at the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary , and Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on 27 June announced that the message of the Chinese authorities urge not only Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the U.S. message drew an angry response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the foreign affairs that &quot; no country have the right to inter@@ fere and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer a couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international commitments . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to make sure to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally . &quot;

&quot; the German government speakers St@@ eff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u receives all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 top in Hamburg .
previously published diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Re@@ uters that China had big concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could be over@@ shad@@ owed to visit Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China asked to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to deal with his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us An@@ walt , AF@@ P previously told that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted Li@@ u , including someone outside , including its lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada calls China to maintain its international human rights liabilities , including the freedom of expression , and release the rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France for the United Kingdom
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China in a statement on 29 June to release li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to make sure Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o all treatments which he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family can have contact to him . &quot;
&quot; although the message sender France Info reported that the French government Li@@ u would welcome in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually record it . &quot;
Taiwan
the Council of the Festival in Taiwan urge China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance to those seeking peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development .
the ta@@ iw@@ an@@ ese authorities of Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u called for China to allow China to treat the cran@@ ks intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on 28 June for Li@@ u and gave it to pray that many who asked him to pray for li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for whom he was pun@@ ished , to a harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

Singapore is a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognised as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Minister K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the B@@ log@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of residence of the State of New York , the Minister expressed that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because they are compared in Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore was considered to be a city .
... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , with most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and efforts to create this valuable land , one hear that we will not be a land . &quot;
&quot; it sounded that vul@@ gar , it had the sem@@ b@@ ulation of a escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory violation . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons expressed by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal lands , &quot; in view of what he appeared inevitably . &quot;
&quot; however , it def@@ ends the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian fe@@ asi@@ bility to be able to leave the twi@@ sted logic , since they are better suited to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end of the last week , the answers to his American guests were given to our press , our jubil@@ atives , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ged with no @-@ answers ration@@ ale way .
Rachel Z@@ eng invites Shan@@ gr@@ aceful to clear his opinion because they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so the country is part of our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our new K Shan@@ gr@@ aceful would take the effort to clear this point , if it was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on his comment on the blog , he pointed out to the reviews that one should begin to understand the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ aceful , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the Co@@ ordin@@ ance .
&quot; he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore was so un@@ important , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he gets Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party in ten @-@ ten years ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is not a land , &quot; he obviously did not meant it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , who makes a leader of an immediate generation , such pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am over what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what awaits me - be I with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he really believes and aware what he is defending . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review breaks the weaknesses of Shan@@ gr@@ aceful arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; ben@@ ign for a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher Ver@@ speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the governance body , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ gr@@ ass@@ am is serious . &quot;
&quot; why does the av@@ ala lock their military service , they defend it only their city but not their country ? &quot;
whom must our Prime Minister pay back invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink personnel training ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not told , what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have many im@@ min@@ ers to have anno@@ yed ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we always have a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; &quot; etc . , but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of a continuing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series originates from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question which is asked me most in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ?
&quot; no , I am sorry , I answered then . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to show an interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by providing personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then , on my clari@@ fying the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice ho@@ ckey , Nature &quot; . many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook perhaps in@@ war@@ dly before W@@ ut , if they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t distur@@ b it . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distinguishes us can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack if they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans are on the other ... .
&quot; that was how I began 20 years ago , travelling through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before 11 September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le sheets at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
simultaneous marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are courteous .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposedly considered the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we are Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admired . &quot;
I would make a difference to me if one would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot;
&quot; first , as &quot; nice &quot; said to be said , basically to be spar@@ se - like the gut@@ ters , gentle , but tragic un@@ important figure NE@@ D Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like NE@@ D Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing , where you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless is to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
&quot; this can be a good thing , if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that pass around one around . &quot;
&quot; I would even go as far as going , say that the desire to be free and alone , a main character of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ tional as &apos; nice &apos; , is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadian does not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &apos; nice &apos; . our prime minister has Canada straight to sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ des Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a music video released the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ ded , which in 2014 , took the power and despite their promises to restore the civil government , continue the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about which rules make him his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video refers to the persistent military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a great success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video was shared on Facebook 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; the dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political issues , the Thailand in the past three years have been per@@ plex@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ in section 44 of the provisional constitution , which provides the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army , full @-@ making power over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for setting change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded as critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and im@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to re@@ use activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit in the army was also established , the online content is monitored and persons , which are thrown down , the monarchy is wast@@ ed , prosec@@ uted , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a stri@@ k@@ ingly crus@@ hed against &quot; l@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ a@@ eval ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was established in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the j@@ un@@ ta continues to be followed , is their decision expensive U boats to buy , although security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a wast@@ age of tax @-@ care . &quot;
&quot; in the video it will even be shown , as individuals will be thrown into a black hole , before they bring them into an inter@@ pol@@ ation camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison , because they have supposedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users will have long le@@ aded , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band showed the Sal@@ ut out of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; who was already used by coup opponents during the protests . &quot;
life goes on to the ruins of the violin cities in Eastern Europe .

&quot; the post @-@ war company recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there have been more than 20 years since the Georgian war was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ass@@ ava are located in the lower basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , weak@@ ens , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , there are the largest part of Russians and ch@@ asen in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called violin cities in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people lived here today , there are only a few hundred people living in these host@@ esses . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 the total population of the district in 16@@ ,000 people was barely increased by over a decade . &quot;
in 1989 around 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; the empty five @-@ story housing of the Soviet Union from the early 1960 &apos;s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and quite rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens who served all of the community . &quot;
now there are only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union .
in the spirit city of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ cho@@ ow@@ kas , which can accomo@@ date one or two families , one recognizes the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately draw back . &quot;
&quot; our mother was forbidden to leave us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply has forbidden us , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed her girlfriend something to and suddenly she left the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish @-@ mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence sector ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ purpose ) such as zo@@ ot@@ echni@@ cs , be@@ ekeeping and vegetables . &quot;

in Mexico home &quot; Mama Africa &quot; immigrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America cross , some places will be announced for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is on the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - J@@ old daughter , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ qu@@ ell and golden ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears form . &quot;
&quot; it is born , Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name M@@ om Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) has become an aim for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian &apos;s who are on the journey .
the hotel has rather no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with meal , cru@@ m@@ ble walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some of them have already slept on cardboard . &quot;
I would like to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medicines that they can not pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam , accompanied by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is before a short time . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao Family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) posi@@ tional with Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to do normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a famous name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest out of Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often travel together the way and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his companion was Michel@@ et previously lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Championship .
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weak@@ ened , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the B@@ usti@@ cket after ti@@ res@@ p .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we will never leave them again , &quot; &quot; he smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests can send their often text messages , when they are gone to gr@@ ind them or to tell her about the course of their journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought it to cook chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through tap@@ est@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family emig@@ rated to their small house .
it is pol@@ ishing and has noted that the B@@ usti@@ ckets are sold to many African immigrants .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchenette outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests make through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was reported after a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants , who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to comp@@ ress money out of him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a single @-@ minded , has offered him its roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives still there and she is trying to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the travelers consult their phones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone . &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother she sh@@ aken her in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ es who made her a customer in , some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more , boy and Old . &quot;
she was sad for her while she presents me shortly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; you are already gone . &quot;

&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the cell @-@ users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an area of the city of Uru@@ m@@ qi received a cell notice , in which it indicates the District Government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the notification , the app will be said to access terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , if the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they were shortly after they had replaced the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police report that the app will determine the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists and follow , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ l website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ ic@@ u Telec@@ om .

this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , depres@@ sed ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit distur@@ ban@@ ces and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cl@@ ams and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ entary internet circuits . &quot;
&quot; the news based on Twitter @-@ Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( &quot; , &quot; has been published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where the sec@@ tari@@ ffs installed by a check@@ point where they installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
mobile notification demanded that people are installing the app within 10 days .
&quot; when you are detected on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a return for technological development .
&quot; they have forced people to use devices , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of the imprisonment by the rest of the rest .
we are back again in ma@@ os China .

&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the row &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane ends his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you see and stand firm , that you are all alone in a place where everything has disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has been gradually dis@@ band@@ ed , and a truth is revealed , which is clearly recognizable from both inside and outside . &quot;
one which makes her name all glory .
one who has put down in a list of emotions and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get the reality again and you turn behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the performer - transform the characters from meat and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt can solve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the earth are trapped on the axis of the un@@ part . you will be clear that you have been caught up between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not yet , so that I will form@@ ulate my lesson , as the chief of the security agent it form@@ ulate - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he presented his power over us by pointing even the simplest concepts that we knew .
five young people were stir@@ red during a peaceful protests such as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was drawn , so that the city was disper@@ sed the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Allah Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all city districts , only my own does not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands in a city that &apos;s up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; during the third night things had cal@@ med down something , after the power supply in the district might work . &quot;
&quot; I broke the silence , by crying several times &quot; &quot; All ahu &quot; &quot; of my house @-@ roof . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence contradic@@ ting .
a few minutes later some of my friends were brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , real friends joined me ; we joined us to a beautiful image , full of my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you realize that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the bar@@ ley . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet the military security building . &quot;
he placed on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can give you your voice , after you have made them all the way up to the office of the safety service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear me how you are &quot; &quot; Allah Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; or you are only courageous enough to cry , if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ ull eyes sh@@ aded up on me .
&quot; and you really sad , what to look to me in your eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
&quot; what I did , has nothing to do with courage . &quot;
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was on my fool@@ ish@@ ness , van@@ ity , maybe in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so safe to me , when I answered , &quot; I have not thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; I think I have never ceased to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I am not a word of what I have said . &quot;
&quot; puts him in single and his father equal to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father equal to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the skir@@ m@@ ank of this cur@@ sed sentence is up to now in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture , which I was subjected to months . &quot;
I cry the farm .
&quot; in the first office I let everything go back , what I wear with me . &quot;
then go through the yard and into the second office that leads through a gear to the single cells .
I figured out all the details carefully before I gave the room .
otherwise they have probably shared a bigger cell to me this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and may immediately put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the be@@ amer left the cell , and I laid back on an old proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; &quot; Dro@@ w@@ ler &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells lay an respected man middle @-@ aged man , which looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness can be seen in me no mark@@ ers face , and doctors are not there ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers are one of its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ators had assured me , they would fre@@ eing him if I stay . &quot;
liar .
&quot; I would like to have a bir@@ ch in order to drive all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I hear it still &quot; &quot; All &quot; &quot; Three Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it needs to be around 10 am in the evening ; always around those time the scre@@ ams every day .
the door opens itself .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of the writing until I saw the yellow light , which presented to us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ no@@ des on 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
&quot; they are here , to be heard . &quot;
&quot; that was the secret to protect us : to protect the state security before us and prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fes@@ sions experience and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is here is not a land ; it is a curse to call it co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ an into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I gave the audi@@ t@@ orium and come to Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the face @-@ expressions , the boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and to protest on demonstrations that are coming soon to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used it acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication of communication .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me told me that I had to get used to be pun@@ ished , although I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
at punishment in all its variety .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ ister .
your Hen@@ ker rejo@@ iced to your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with it , and you cannot with@@ hold your loved ones . &quot;
&quot; my loved ones fell not enough , so they inter@@ changeable the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked once more than a garbage dump or if this was one of the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined , to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within one hour three of them rarely change three of them while still in the row .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I heard . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and found no favor by it why he accessed as the next to an electri@@ cally invited stack .
flow through my entire body enough to feed my entire quarter .
&quot; my semi @-@ nude body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect outlet . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must be so at midnight .
I decided to put myself asleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours left , which came to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of an exhaustive youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father needs to worry fear@@ lessly . &quot;
&quot; be silent and walk you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b speaks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken from A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the majority of his time inside ; sometimes he moves to his canvas , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what one can rely on , is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house which has been part of them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel ended up his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family were forced to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate majority who faces the conservative majority and asks its old proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality , and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian people , but he also calls out the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not only be found in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that from Damascus to S@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a person who is not limited by boundaries in his mind , and he can feel his own statement by human beings who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it , he swe@@ pt up against the US American foreign policy a special dis@@ appearance . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian &quot; Palestinian people &quot; , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine before . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living conditions so , &quot; stresses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he sh@@ utt@@ eth a man in water . it is the Holy month of Ramadan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ arian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sing hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically they speak of a warm coffee and the sn@@ ake of the K@@ ent cig@@ ar in the nose in the first place of freedom .
&quot; Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when one throws a view into the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one simply avo@@ ids basic things to do - as in the public during Ramadan ) - to land not in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior of Jord@@ ani@@ ens has a performance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary groups , who support the Islamic Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ t@@ ary is contradic@@ tory to the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the S &amp; D spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the S@@ kan@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; many claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be more dangerous activ@@ ism who constitutes the old proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a saw the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; who continue to appoint themselves &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement might not be easy @-@ to @-@ end rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic but actually a clear and clear reality in Jordan , which clearly expresses in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs plant . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s traditional gender standards to be Lei@@ f by giving his vision of the fate of Arab women , the pre@@ dominant sex . &quot;
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly lower @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust .
&quot; over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; Hon@@ orary mur@@ ders &quot; &quot; - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch , according to its cul@@ mination , the number of volunteers in the year 2016 reached its cul@@ mination ; however , Jordan is still missing to support the women , the victims tried Mor@@ des or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for crime against corruption in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence , and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family , that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known , but also not h@@ ein@@ ous subjects that were long as tab@@ u in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b indu@@ bit@@ able that his work is politically , however , that he is his music , who is full of explicit attacks on sexuality , freedom and expression , not separate politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; to me , politics was conven@@ ed , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are politically politically , can be pursued further . &quot;
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be it belief or non @-@ faith , h@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he notices that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still strongly committed in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b brought an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an Online@@ Programme Ro@@ ya to later notice that his comments from the context were torn down , twi@@ sted and his opinion turned to c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a processed version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b bu@@ ys openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which remained in mind today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asked yourself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who should later work once on behalf of the cali@@ ph , in the eighth century could write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ i not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an intelligence service was held by several former government members and members of the teaching network , with the ration@@ ale , they thought of based on comments in social media which coinci@@ des with deep in the land of rooted corruption . &quot;
&quot; in view of what is the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , according to that , only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan @-@ Spani@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan is now a gig , but the path of progress - it consists of slow , prin@@ cipl@@ ed and inner changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreams not only dre@@ amed his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of it to experience . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will help with music , art and literature of genuine and basic openness - and not by bom@@ bs , streams and artificial species . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until that time , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and therefore also resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war pu@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; they assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many regions of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory asser@@ ted that the festivities , the drums and the dancing over more than one thousand years have come across the northeast , to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to force the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to sn@@ ap a few great seats , so we have a super view . &quot;
it can only be hard to imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two festivities are currently watching .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival the only True - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care is as important as in this story , because they help to hold the Peruvian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote an legitimate profession like those of the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important harbour , is located on the coast of the Pacific ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road rau@@ b and illegal drugs trading are daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus the fancy hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has resulted in getting more norm@@ al@@ ers into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can make these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , who go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers of your &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os , &quot; who is taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts in each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions can be found on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to share their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to preserve them in the hair@@ dressing room instead of bad advice , which allow them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the active opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in March of the year before and reported on some of their successes :

Colombia : love news@@ letters on guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare

use with friendly permission .
&quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; love message to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who know we ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel spread out to offer affection ? &quot;
&quot; precisely this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists , Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Stiftung Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os , from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , no longer from the head and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people to write &quot; &quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare . &quot;
&quot; only recently , her land was a place of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was considered the under@@ mark of peace treaty , as significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bian , there is a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and , around the clock , they have to integrate their weapons again into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society again , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , it must now be able to record them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian people join together and would have to help with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare - who will then be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letter to reconciliation emerged on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , who took place in February 2017 in Bogot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian have the opportunity to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he explained that we love the people who love , on Valentine &apos;s Day of thousands of love letters , but those forgot that they need much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he continues to share his love with people this year , which needed the urgent popularity . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan , letter full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and to build up a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history of a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , in the context of the campaign more than 2000 letters were collected . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogot@@ á . &quot;
I have never imagined that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogot@@ a traveled into the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done before in order to counter@@ increase the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of protection from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , told the policy knowledge and Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former fighters led me to the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa @-@ fighter . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ mer &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ ill@@ ill@@ ary struggles live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid of responding , as next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in the bush . &quot;
&quot; and I said it anyway , and said , &quot; &quot; hello , what are they doing right ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
&quot; never in my life , someone has written something so beautiful , so I answered that . &quot; then I suddenly had the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embrace him very seriously and set me next to the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was pity the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighters and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society there , which is waiting with open arms for us . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion . &quot;
the students had grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC also declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how to develop social injustice from the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people , we can contribute to creating a political party in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard before and had no electoral law , and recognizing that the people that I have often seen as mon@@ ster and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings were turned out by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - even those who killed , and so much damage , can bring us something and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Kolum@@ bi@@ ans was proph@@ esi@@ ed that after the dis@@ armament peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as inequality gives inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are ready to protest to the weapons and to protest for their rights . this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , to a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all defen@@ ders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
with horror activists have experienced the coverage of the last months on the persecution of sul@@ ul@@ er men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed like a D@@ amo@@ is value over the dor@@ sal LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only taken over night .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered several months ago by the international head@@ lines , after reports have been published , the ab@@ re@@ ation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta , she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who susp@@ ect que@@ er men arres@@ ts and made them in secret pr@@ isons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a Monster to the World &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ lady , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was in fact a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she was born , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Che@@ et@@ ected of the sexually in@@ fusion of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , they passed over to the USA in the end . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer hero@@ in at a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone took my help .
&quot; it was a acquain@@ tance from D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife who put in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; I tried to help her , made someone , of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents were made by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just doing some shopping at the back of my car , I heard a male voice say : &quot; here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ ward the family , you che@@ que ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ woke in the end again in the hospital .
apparently some women had got it all along and started to cry .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I was driving that I had two keywords in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you placed - in which men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name , but the doctor arose and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ club .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
those demanded to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
&quot; they asked absurd claims : some said to me , I had to prove it by opening up without the roads lead ; others wanted me to have changed my sex in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have gra@@ zing size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some elderly people spoke once my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that not only your family , but the entire Republic has damaged . &quot;
&quot; we cannot stir you , because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she fell a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luckily the neighbors and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with dark@@ ened windows and a numerical shield with a 95 dr@@ on .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it was clear to me that there was something lazy . &quot;
my human rights friends inspec@@ ting the num@@ eric signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you leave ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give her name but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something in@@ credible . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without having to register , without ID , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage .
arrived and check@@ ed to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I didn &apos;t ask a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you will be in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which Hotel du st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still have contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality . however , this is a tab@@ oos . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ ca@@ sian elements I still wear in me .
&quot; as much as I desire , this sail@@ or barrier can not overcome . &quot;
&quot; I am always saying that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we ch@@ atting with camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person that they remember from their past - thus to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the time I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with someone who has sent one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ramadan , he was not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait , and he did not closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives before , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there even more gay men in this secrecy ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine saying that there were just not many .
&quot; if , then most of all those who have no wealthy relatives , or have been dropped by their relatives to put Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there , so that they can present them later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , you will show your body on television and claim them , they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not just gone , but specifically sur@@ faced to radi@@ ate itself . &quot;
OC Media : is this just a failure or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just zi@@ pped someone the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after their beard grew . &quot;
there was nothing new about them since then .
they simply have taken them off .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was by himself as these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; but until now , they were not introduced as ban@@ dits , there has been no reports so far . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why otherwise one could not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; know if this persecution and performances of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already been in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I had my hair always long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe in front of 2003 I was already known in Gros@@ ny as I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; civil society &quot; , &quot; but we finally returned to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had colored lashes , carried ey@@ es@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops . &quot;
the safety of the sh@@ aria has never bent me only one hair .
&quot; there was a place in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole town knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , there met . &quot;
we have never been compensated .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte not over the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
you often say it often to children if those who make themselves funny through sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes in front of you because they believed , they are sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never compensated and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this grace be kept ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister 2005 , he began to speak on his morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us , but above all about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how people started in the city to change . &quot;
&quot; who had sm@@ iles and logged in , regarded you at one time with Ar@@ g@@ w@@ ohn . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I was able to feel how the situation in the Republic is constantly worse . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t di@@ gest much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the United States .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ ups , meetings , I beg@@ ining them to hospital and help them to get Essen@@ ti@@ ff . &quot;
I do not receive a c@@ ents for a long time .
I discovered these people themselves when I got a hiding place .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : carry a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ oud .
&quot; thus nature , this is pure nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ yan , who want to proph@@ es@@ y with foam before mouth , that there is no s@@ b@@ umps on them . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have what is the cab@@ ard@@ iner , who have the Russians also who are on the whole planet - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I am from there , so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear . &quot;
I come here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and during Ramadan - live with men together .
&quot; you know many think of Tran@@ si@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that you can change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a chest . &quot;
&quot; these are two distinct things - two different kinds of feeling , to be accurate , different lifestyle settings . &quot;
for me it is most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed me for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m here so personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad for that - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffered from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there have been a strong increase of self @-@ murder . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August the desp@@ ised situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ elight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ ame@@ ful to be able to arise for his own assistance , the in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups , who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video get@@ table video held the moments after he had approached himself , fixed . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to clear the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything else . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists from place warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt thanks to the persecution of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and un@@ able to feed their families and to follow a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region where most of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community is located , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to ride their livel@@ i@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a primarily autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took over power and assumed 1925 great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most productive and most valuable user areas for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water of the Arab territories in the Persian regions where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to devast@@ ation the devast@@ ation in the region caused by dr@@ y@@ ness and destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palms @-@ industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi youth now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Ko@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who are looking for a job , finished elementary school and have 45 % a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ himi , an Iranian ancestors human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high increase &quot; &quot; the number of self @-@ murder among young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ himi said that especially unemployment has become more recently worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z , re @-@ emerging ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; functional and institutions are not preferred to Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi gives access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to make their living outside of their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their pros and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the ancestors and be asked , since even Arab names in the workplace will not toler@@ ate , because the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances , which have to end@@ ure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi , the human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is guarded and aware of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is un@@ question@@ able depression .

&quot; why I am not identification with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alist &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i , originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a Femin@@ ist , a lot of women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with frustration . &quot;
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even thought well by scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women today despite equal education are still less money than men . &quot;
&quot; that women are still under strict observation , if it &apos;s about doing what they are doing with their body . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later in various sectors of life on a smooth roof , and that discrimination based on sex still passes through the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is conscious of me and well @-@ known .
I am convinced of it and I am double and triple including .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to a skin colour , in racism , on black CIS women , on black borders , women , on black borders , women , and verbal abuse , on which kind we have been physically , se@@ el@@ ically and verbal abuse , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , decide to mention many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless all agree that women - all women should come together to up@@ lift their voices and sing &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it in addition to sexu@@ alized violence an institu@@ tion@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two times .
&quot; or moreover , that black women and women from other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girl and girls with a migration background of the school are referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence and violence , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand I want to have all women , all men , and all men , neither skin colour , the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot consider myself a black woman in whose center is the white woman who refuse to consider the inj@@ us@@ tices in their thinking that relate to the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m exhausted and will no longer fight my membership in a white fem@@ ini@@ ist oriented sphere , which always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again . &quot;
&quot; So@@ gn@@ ner said 18@@ 51 in her speech , &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to sustain an ideology , in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb through cultural ex@@ propri@@ ation our customs and customs , to advance its ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer attempt to raise white women the importance of abundance of skin colour and sex . for some of them continue to remain the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different countries at home , and boundaries of white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I invite it to dis@@ solve myself full of femin@@ ism and to join the movement of Wom@@ an@@ ism , which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas , and enter into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ass@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ew : as we can regain ourselves ( e.g. : Africa Wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can ourselves regain ourselves by making ourselves completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , se@@ el@@ ic , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after they read these lines , please ask about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I existed . &quot;
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm .

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine dedicated to resolve international efforts to solve environmental issues . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again . &quot;
&quot; again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the past 7 years - mostly with Surf@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a particular concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution in His church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; tells Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war , the construction of reser@@ vo@@ dges , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ e@@ pers Iraq - an affiliate of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - to protect the rivers , streams and water paths in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive then ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , resident docum@@ ent@@ aries and multimedia journalist , filmed and published . &quot;
&quot; the main focus of her work lies on a little noticeable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video photography and new m@@ ultim@@ edi@@ al techniques , with their help oppressed communities to tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paraguay women and their difficult struggle against violence
&quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ nings in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &apos; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft that reported on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the persons affected .
&quot; said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she has nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its Ex@@ partner who had become violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship was some time passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to Mis@@ sy , also the acc@@ ru@@ ary display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez is nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman drew its display .
breaking the Teu@@ fel@@ lows of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are refund at all times , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , prove to be victims of violence at all times . &quot;
content of 1 beats and statisti@@ c 2 Un@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a judicial system that nothing under@@ scored 3 of Paraguay laws : good approach to lack of pun@@ ching and statistics
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ leading , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , a research assistant at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are various statements and reports , but not even ans@@ ate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are very alar@@ ming . &quot;
in 2015 at the District Apostle N@@ 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of it we went to violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were over 5000 ads for domestic violence at the peace . also here 86 % of the ads of women came .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically mis@@ leading , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s mini@@ ster@@ in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di will actually appear only a few of these crimes also actually displayed . &quot; on every woman , which will be re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic mi@@ tigation , are 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on every woman , which will be re@@ funded due to physical mi@@ tigation , are two women who do not do so , stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since the women &apos;s genocide in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ences , the prosecution authorities can not adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
only until August 2016 were journalists at least 12 cases of women &apos;s genocide in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to its estimates in Paraguay , every ten days dies a woman due to violence caused by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ tigation and a judicial system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z the fixed friend of Carlos Vera was , he insi@@ sted that she called his name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she did not want this , but then after . this should rep@@ ent it forever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years , she carried out the mental violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe : &quot;
I have never imagined that I would once again become victims of mis@@ leading .
&quot; when I have read earlier this , I always thought that only women were happening , who are mist@@ aken , because they dec@@ eive themselves of violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana useless social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote contributions on Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ults and different attacks during their two year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mis@@ leading . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook @-@ users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have a certain complic@@ ity to it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which does not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner has been mis@@ leading . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
you do that which many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic mi@@ tigation .
&quot; your wealthy partner , it finally managed to convince them that it was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vic@@ tori@@ as ads in the authorities stayed with no result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a trial against their former partner who developed into an un@@ search@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of Mis@@ an is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also provides great problems with the application of laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Für@@ l ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the motion # Ni@@ im@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
&quot; the original draft of the law looks before , Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain and harder to pun@@ ish and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; thus , the legislative text was altered in some points to also win the MPs for the law that they feared that the road for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tion is basically forbidden to be pun@@ ished in Paraguay , and to be pun@@ ished with up to five years . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was fores@@ een , the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that need to carry the victims of violence at present , if they simply will refund and find a safe place to stay up to the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective , if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , mis@@ trading is seen as part of inter@@ personal relations . &quot;
&quot; here , one thing must take place , that violence is no longer considered as some normal times . &quot;
&quot; in view of these facts , he ple@@ aded not guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators brought forth . &quot;
we have to refund as long as we do not apply to Mis@@ o .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . before , parts of the law were changed , but among other things , one passage were cancel@@ ed , which called the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
&quot; the section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , his sacrifice once again attack . &quot;
&quot; the filing of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered to be a great return . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man remains subjected to prohibition of a newspaper
&quot; this website has been locked due to a resolution of the Information Minister , &quot; the Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s homepage can be read on the homepage of the Forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than one year ago the French authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting about corruption in the sult@@ ant .
&quot; You@@ z@@ al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he had a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Number of Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and placed on trial , but came back later . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been governed by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 after he had put his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state coup . &quot;
&quot; since then , he suffers from his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defense , commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Foreign Minister , Minister of Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of sult@@ an is characterized by the per@@ sever@@ ance efforts of the security forces , especially domestic freedom , including freedom of domestic freedom , including press freedom , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , to intim@@ id@@ ate and det@@ ain@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ ders citizens , also campa@@ ign@@ ers to express their views on public affairs , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions as well as offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure , and the detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor , was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , after in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , it was published by corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in court decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government prosec@@ uted , judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man was put under pressure to lift up a ver@@ dict in an inheritance . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Pro@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the board of the board , were arrested by the ISS before the special department and taken at his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS at the Deputy Editor of You@@ z@@ al You@@ z@@ Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had acts to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is Fest@@ ing as Chief Editor @-@ editor .
&quot; the paper was closed at un@@ definite period after the Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to pr@@ isons and or@@ da@@ ined the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned both among others because of the disorder of public order , &quot; misuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the State &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the injury of a public ban and ple@@ aded for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison pen@@ alties and don@@ ors in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . additionally a one @-@ year profession was imposed against the two journalists .
&quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of prison and a prison sentence of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US Dollar ) after making use of a material network for the spread of material , which could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit was issued at the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the prono@@ unc@@ ement of the custody . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ al Tribunal , Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i said to be released in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months of prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the out@@ pouring of his six @-@ month prison sentence in the prison law . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he had his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Information Ministry to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again allow the newspaper to be exposed by the government government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Information Minister granted a statement , with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information ministers personally signed a further statement , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister expressed himself again against the decision of the appeal to permit the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in O@@ man the press has been in@@ jured . &quot;
&quot; for example , the closure of the website of independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ ine and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , set the first independent online newspaper of the country , its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare the comprehensive injury of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Golf @-@ Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities on : &quot;
1 . You@@ z@@ al @-@ Ha@@ j to release immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2 . create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists work with their work ;
3 . press freedom in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , to ensure human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man their right@@ ful human rights work un@@ folded and without fear of precautions , including judicial b@@ ans . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia : figure takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research , there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vaccines to offer the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria in the poorest countries in Africa have far more serious impact than elsewhere , and lack investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists to build up their own research capacity in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors is the Director of the centr@@ al@@ ors at the Center for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic is the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Sam@@ bia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he explored himself at HIV @-@ Virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ine health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ ors speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ging national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory testing .
&quot; in addition , I have just got a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
G@@ V : what are your opinion of the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no fundamental research . we only rely on solutions that have been developed somewhere else .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being mo@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , continuous supply with electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there are need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often , it is the limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that journals are only accessible for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed resources will change global food production
&quot; this entry from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant produced by NASA A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in Space and consumed . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was put on work only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question , how many sal@@ at@@ ants can get , boundaries . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he believed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he therefore could not continue to use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green , or ar@@ ded sheets . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more of such patents have been signed on more and more plants like corn or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mor@@ ton is still a salad , but it is now longer necessary because his work is more and more limitations . &quot;
&quot; it is , when I lie in a river a rock bro@@ ck , to which I have to p@@ addle . &quot;
&quot; so we have to make this now , but it is a break with the culture tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents on sal@@ ads go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and when they with@@ stand before dish , no one can breed any new sal@@ at@@ sor@@ ties , because all the features are already patented , and so he tries to re@@ fine those features . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the U.S. and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; ) .
&quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Roman salt in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and ate . there is tested , whether plants can be grown in space . &quot;

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement originated from the IT field , and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; software , the alternatives to copyrighted software available . &quot;
&quot; it was established in life to ensure that some plant species are protected and , not being protected as intellectual property , and so for plant breeders are permanently available . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the initiative , in short Ossi , US breeders can commit to commit themselves that others can be cultivated by them seed @-@ free . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and can sell it . &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seed , and it does not immediately appeal - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Ossi @-@ board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed plays an important role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of peasants , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to make the latter not or only little by working seed with natural res@@ ili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants might be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; who wants to purchase good , locally and sustain@@ ably producing fu@@ sions in the global agricultural industry , it should also know that the way it is offered in peasant markets , it should also know that the way that this vegetables is bred . &quot;
&quot; nour@@ ishment without seeds , is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to putting others their seed well freely available . thus their action is opposed to pat@@ enting seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Ossi Sup@@ ports argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available natural pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material that is thus always restricted , un@@ controll@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of Ossi , has been engaged in her PhD thesis with gene@@ alogy and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ on characteristics are protected as intellectual property , thus it is usable for plant breeders or not only . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that mass @-@ in plants like wheat are patented in a larger style as salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants will be bred that they are targeted - from such , through which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments to flour@@ ish and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is increasing by increasingly more patents . genetic diversity is currently unnecessary than ever since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail recognis@@ es Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four comrades and the cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States set out the company for the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property promote other bre@@ eder , since &quot; patents and protection of plant reproductive innovations encourage innovation . &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
such protection does not inhi@@ bits innovations not but also encourages them to be provided by the public more material and know @-@ how .
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees that different : 20 years to wait , until a patent has no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for such a long time , in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one could have lost the struggle already . &quot;
&quot; but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is however , that genetic resources have always been a general well and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives have not been attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make farmers ease their work .
&quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us , and it will make us impossible if we can not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mor@@ ton does not inter@@ fere with the concept to make plant peculi@@ arity : &quot; &quot; we do not create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants themselves form them out and as breeders have finally no idea of how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the US @-@ State Oregon and Ossi board , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who is bred a variety , and also bred its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ es , for their cultivation of mass@@ aging Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de , bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; my concept is exactly spot@@ lessly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than any Mon@@ san@@ to have ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ ton also believes that bre@@ eder by the prevention of plant patented innovative would : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies , the patent . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a couple of years ago , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent is one 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it very easy to do in my opinion . &quot;
&quot; while the United States seem to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; cat@@ tery , but now the concept spreads rapidly all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program . for receiving the seed of traditional farm animals working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &apos; seeds and to sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ ements works on an &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; license , which ultimately is a form@@ ative and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for bre@@ eder differ from country to country , but the Ossi obligation cannot simply become one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , says that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent policy , the patents on conventional plants are allowed . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all in East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems states that the organization is currently preparing a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for which planned next year of the official start signal . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group to ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity around the world to publish a seed map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Es@@ sens - a composite of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published . in this , it represents the possibility that farmers have the opportunity to exchange and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply is emphasized by seed for sustainable food systems - a connection by the Lu@@ by of Ossi that will soon become more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially taken care of where and how something grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear@@ est that even more behind their foods are . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are recent destinations in the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the internet .
&quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend at the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian Government has documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world , and reported on them . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed sharp@@ ly for this step and spoke to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information , - despite this attack and the potential of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , to uph@@ ill this goals and to give victims one voice , even though it was never so difficult to overcome these goals , so it was never so difficult to overcome the block@@ age . we insist on it to further fulfil our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first @-@ owned website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked over two months 21 websites , such as independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and that from Qatar &apos;s network of Al J@@ aze@@ era because of alleged &quot; support from terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of web@@ pages for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , there is also no access to the blog of the Kolum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles , which he does not write for in Egypt with accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas &apos;s blog is native , but on the other hand is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video like the police force physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook @-@ commentary , Zi@@ ada on the blocking through the government and refl@@ ective what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the to un@@ lock blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fatal tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even though the block@@ age of the blogs may not be significant for the world , it is however for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of a si@@ ege of si@@ ege ; a arrest murder , an attempt by the national Security Council , the block@@ age blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You proved that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
&quot; however , after having locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the Mu@@ ch go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this takes technical testing in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented , moreover , the block@@ age of vendors who was possible through the relocation of plug @-@ in and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the block@@ age of websites , the V@@ P@@ N@@ s began , began . &quot;
such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content on the Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation becomes in addition wast@@ ed that the fin@@ ens@@ ored decision behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which they can prevent the court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it attack next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day of day report newspapers in all of Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school killed , &quot; &quot; Each second day is murdered a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ st@@ rau@@ lt Ph@@ armacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air was@@ hers to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the non @-@ violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian organization of Global Justice even called to intervene the United Nations .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least you find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; the article published for the detailed report on violence in Rio well @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August 2010 &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now being published .
the motives for their decision declared the paper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , smo@@ b , sex , etc . all , which happens from the civili@@ zed standard , and what happens only in Rio , is in the section &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we do not exclude our eyes before cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ ild , the chief editor of the newspaper that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper throughout the world with a war in a country , which does not recognise the war at all . &quot;
&quot; in the same video , a journalist called the newspaper that there are according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the article article writes the newspaper :
&quot; us is aware that a war @-@ dis@@ course , when it is distor@@ ted , too , too , atro@@ cities of the police , who have only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to cover . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than they use ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ si@@ l ar@@ gues the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the contrary , to call the violence as a &quot; war &quot; . in their opinion , according to a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could complain , responsible for the police to account . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - such as extra in analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ reli@@ ance of public service . &quot;
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro are &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is false : &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we watch the rates per federal state , Rio in position 16 , writes them . &quot;
&quot; specially belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media companies South America , which stresses , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state . &quot;
&quot; this security measures also belonged to the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a massive police manager a Fav@@ ela by adding a unit permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . for a number of years , the U@@ PP was supposed to protect against several reports on track and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities that actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio did not correspond to the - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this demands the state to use , means and ways that are typical for a war . this includes intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; &quot; fine &quot; , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and is the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; &quot; ir@@ red balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ our@@ isms in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
a week it is now that the police took the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho er@@ om@@ m to en@@ roll the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an orch@@ eller died as a result of shots that the police had ch@@ op@@ ed out of a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
screenshot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 , and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities are suffering from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 requested the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the mass@@ acre of Assad has been practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these have been controlled by rebels control areas outside Damascus under si@@ ege , which led to that residents are dependent on local or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ ages , traditional foods such as meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; in return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ fal@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to conventional foods which are cultivated in Syria and are only extremely rare part of Syrian cuisine . however it makes them an attractive food source for many local inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
&quot; the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said opposite the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been campa@@ ign@@ ing for three years to announce this project and expressed its relief from that it is gaining more and more &quot; &quot; famili@@ arity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , using the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ fal@@ da , the humanitarian cro@@ w@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to im@@ part 125 families knowledge of the pl@@ anting of mushrooms , such as L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of its expected target of around 12.@@ 700 , but will continue until Monday , 04 . September 2017 , continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of the fuel scar@@ city , locally used fuel are used made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of the regions coming from the regions , before they tested their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
then they planted a small fung@@ al in a tub . as this managed they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; now , they have designed a &quot; &quot; prof@@ essor@@ ship for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread all the mushrooms everywhere in the Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; : break the si@@ ege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; dissemination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by eating remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee , coffee , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women to work at home . &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , ensuring our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege . &quot;
we want our experiences to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21st in many districts in Portugal and demanded for justice for the victims of fires that were cas@@ hed in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ eight people died and approximately 70 were in@@ jured due to the forest fires from the 15th and 16th of October . this led to the government to spend last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the region G@@ ali@@ cia in Spain where there were 4 dead .
&quot; one estimates that there were more than 500 re@@ frac@@ tures , spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande came to a similar tragedy , where the fires were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas with satellite recordings , are burned approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make yourself a better picture of the seriousness of the situation : there is only in 4 districts no fire .
&quot; Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - N@@ ata ( @ a _ at@@ ans ) 15 October , 2017 &quot;

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire measures imposed by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to include the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João Sover@@ al of the federal government of the farmers of Portugal stated the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão were streets and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ evac@@ u@@ ated .
&quot; this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are d@@ ast@@ o@@ fold reports of open streets , which were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , since the streets were very late locked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits are questioned in locations with high Bran@@ dr@@ isi@@ ko . &quot;
a wide @-@ sufficient suggestion for the wh@@ ites in the years 2003 and 2005 were introduced by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; the government led a locom@@ otive of the law to allow the applicant , if the applicant had had a means of self @-@ protection - this was an open back@@ door , so that all could be built , &quot; &quot; João S@@ val in the same article was released by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us made attention to that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of slightly flamm@@ able wood , itself as in a devil @-@ circle , after fires of this species are increasingly spreading . &quot;
&quot; for these problems , the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when inhabitants were looking for or trying to contact members , offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that cat@@ ered the population of information : they used the own civil protection data using the application of fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt , and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina into Life in order to simplify the work of fire defense , and was transferred on this f@@ ateful weekend in October so decisive that the server did not inter@@ fere with the deposit of 400@@ ,000 users who did not with@@ hold the site more than half a million . &quot;

in a night in the autumn of 1994 the Con@@ quest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
&quot; two years ago , a terrible civil war between the different Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings had broken out that had conquered the short @-@ term pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan was a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; exactly at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the G@@ haz@@ ni province for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it back then , she knew she could no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
in the morning the boy was supposed to break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring it to the locks .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hit@@ ara dominated party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat was just murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable . &quot;
the Taliban known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban always came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him ill .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low reward , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed sa@@ ws with mort@@ ar that were harder than he himself to make himself a living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of the Iranian refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , he rec@@ alled A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site , on which we worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we hanging n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we can not er@@ fres@@ her at night .
after four years A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
&quot; during the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered a ship@@ yard and stran@@ ds on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ xen af came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time there was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church dedicated twice a day to eat in need . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for distr@@ acted asylum seekers . it is true , but it &apos;s true that the conditions , the asylum seekers in the country are dis@@ astrous , cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Society for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; &quot; it is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian Law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to an absorption centre if they have officially sent an application for asylum - which can still be drawn months after the registration of the asylum . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation to either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there is also A@@ xen n@@ ā@@ f .
&quot; but his un@@ bound@@ ed life lle helped A@@ shar@@ k , to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after having made various works in the construction sector for several years , A@@ shar@@ af picked up its entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to official estimates , around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans are living in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the different af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also a Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets are far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y market and retail stores , and aim to go back to the country that he had left un@@ gener@@ ously as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; says A@@ ach@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can not live happily when I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
&quot; they represent half of society , and have the same ways as anyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged also plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ vatives . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their seriousness with the market and improve their financial situation &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end , stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af made this trip itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; Ne@@ ar report : legislative disc@@ ord from Egypt allow off social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in custody . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ado &apos;s report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and emerging trends in worldwide internet right shows &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament reviewed a draft law , which provides users with social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority . &quot;
the user would have to be able to use social networks within six months of the subject of the authority on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as their identification number .
who dre@@ amed this step could be sentenced to up to six months in prison or terminate the pen@@ dic@@ ation of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which was advertis@@ ed by sixty members of the parliamentary members , is currently in legislative as well as the constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
may another member of the dep@@ uty proposed a law proposal to be introduced in the tougher pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or high officials .
&quot; under the Egyptian law the ins@@ ing of the president as well as government institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the proposal , such a wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for publishers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which took photographed on 13 August 2013 , while violence against prot@@ esters were demonstrated against military coup that had led to the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested in the same incident , four years in custody on a judgement . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed to the 20th of May , because the pr@@ isons of human rights groups were pushed to prison , the accused of prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , proj@@ ectors from among others arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary freely . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisian activists to be crossed by skill@@ fully documents
&quot; may Tunisian authorities six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been listening to a clever plan of action . bes@@ po@@ ised plan was supported by the President of the Republic , which would expressly guarantee the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption of Am@@ nest@@ y , provided that all un@@ lawful funds will be returned . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the law@@ suit . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the disclosure of his sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisian press release which protects journalists the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he stood at the District Court in Tunis on 09 . may as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to present their credit card ?
&quot; according to new provisions of the Office of the Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need permission in China to write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration with the full potential name will be required . &quot;
analy@@ st suggests that this means an Eli@@ mination of anonymous comments within social networks shall be achieved . it is still unclear how the authorities apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens proposed in social media to enforce these provisions only selective in order to protect citizens &apos; journalism and independence .
let &apos;s then see ourselves in &quot; &quot; We@@ chat &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
not in Russia !
may sper@@ mat@@ ing the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging App We@@ chat .
according to Ros@@ com@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or failed We@@ chat to register with the provincial government as the &quot; organizer of the Information Council . &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government is managing a list of online services that allow the &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for removing Content and to force them on request for the removal of user data . &quot;
&quot; these web pages are currently owned sites such as V@@ Cont@@ acts and Od@@ no@@ is@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the E @-@ Mail @-@ Service Mail@@ .ru and end of other services . &quot;
Turkish dish has Wikipedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish dish provided the blocking Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language items , the data , Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry for Transport , maritime affairs and Communication was blocked because they have been locked into &quot; a source of information that cooperates with groups to have a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey blocked the website completely . it is thus , besides other China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Great Britain cannot stop her@@ edi@@ ble
&quot; following this week , the Government of Great Britain is located in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring mechanisms that would force Internet service providers to monitor communication concentrations in real time and to install back@@ door programs that de@@ cryp@@ t the data encryption programs . &quot;
&quot; the government has consulted telecommunic@@ ation companies and secret services concerning the proposal , but has other technology companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all , the consultation still runs until May 19 . responses and proposals by members of the public can be communicated to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
