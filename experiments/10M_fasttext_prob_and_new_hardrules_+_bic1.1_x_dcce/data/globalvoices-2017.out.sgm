<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>

<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I also grew up with American films, American authors have read American authors and operated by his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, which covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stued the moriderous conspiracy of a oil magnates, which were the supreme level of court with judges that wanted to occupy his interest."</seg>

<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, I had only strengthened my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be that you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very shamanian love reference about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then I came to Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the xenophobia and the racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his bottoms."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never stops behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latino, AfroAmerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in Scharen for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number one was ever reached by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigote person asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to reconcile Trump and his voters with the people that I had seen during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist, the people from all over the world uptake, a deep stitious person, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps's worldview did not agree with the Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met us in our common love for basketball and we spent many hours with them to watch the Phoenix Suns in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr who fought their lives for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped us to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise Council helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who embody through them have deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"during the Trump its path to the nominated republican presidential system, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the debate with the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they either have its racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump-voters as a racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange man, said one of my friends, is just what we led to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most know are, for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that she disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they wanted to perhaps say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who have commented on the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "" (Anm.).: as much as the mount of the White against all other ethnicities, "" phrase from White in Annoff on the White and whiplash, what as much does the big Van Jones called, did exactly that which America has made so great. "</seg>

<seg id="43">"for this country elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenya, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America that promises this promise and says: hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm."</seg>
<seg id="46">"for all this I have to think of Khizr Khan must think the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of election."</seg>

<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby scenic ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, La Banda de Música (Musibande) has been playing in the municipality: one out of children and adults in an existing symphony orchestra, which with their musical instruments has a way to overcome the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music-school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and gangs violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this changed after an accidental meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth was so rare hope of hope."</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work to fight against illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fought wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports international, practicing solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication is done as part of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing, before it was the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were above accordingly, and little inclined to welcome a crusher of this kind to their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they journeyed to give him one of their harbors and refuse to give him a fishing appearance."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursudden was the prime minister surrounded by countries, who simply disguised everything "," remembers Benedict Kiilu, a leading lawyer of the Kenyan fisheries Authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed. "</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch there fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and resources protects, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are besides Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which at that time had driven the Premier out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" in this way, we have eight countries that are equal and working together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending illegally. this project provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is trapped, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to trace. thus, the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing from regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the intentional contempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm, which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail, with the information given between individual countries, the actions are occurring today in real time, with traceable at FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that you may have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open seas, through satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships who fish in the botanic areas. also, so suspicially sailed routes, which suggest that a ship invites its own fish on the road to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the idealcase such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the road and possibly also, whether they have a penal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in its ports. what does the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to order penalties as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it then goes to considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that the illegal fishing catch is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, conductor director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already named platform was created to gain a valued 20 million USD to lost revenues, the eight members of the network HISH-i lose every year because of the illegal fishery that penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive thuna fishing shops that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include events such as sailing under the falster flag, counterfeit royalty, indication of fantasies, the fish protected species and the fish in nature."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "you make use of the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-completely organized control system," "says Long." "formerly a ship could fish illegally and a country could say 'you dared to do my port."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Komm to me'." "and this legal canyon is trying to close the FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH was involved in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has revealed criminal networks, which had shared counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered vessels that are used several fraudulent identities and it has been prosecuted and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing on large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system, the FISH will help, suspected ships of precise locations."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, helps also help the illegal ships to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fishery data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn on for example their automatic identification systems where they can no longer be labelled from satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help at the ISH, criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But then FISH-i's team from African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"the platform Global Fishing Watch has recently opened the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that provides satellite data, and by means of which the position of each traceable ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this simply makes sense, "" says it. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to the examination. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable trust has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminal, but they also cry out."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that have previously without a license, and hardly expected to count with consequences, they now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats do more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 was added, the inspectors found there on board towing networks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries noticing these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we disappear several hundred million dollars every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries have joined together for six countries such as the West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting the illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH." "With safety the goal is to develop even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently the most recent member of Somalia could report its first major triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship which was on the way under the wrong flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were not used for towing networks, which is now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated to grounded waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of dimensional rules against Greko 1 put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a particular, collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes on the theme of the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="238">"I sewn up and saw a song, on the human being tortured."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to transfer, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and transfer active language skills to transfer him into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in case of native language. in general, the conviction that translators is in the target language - not in the source language - native language."</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French native speaker should translate from English to French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lacking understanding of the survival, cost grounds or the relatively low number of English speakers to learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies who have not made their own foreign employees, nevertheless, translations are nevertheless company-internal. then, the Japanese staff, whose English skills are considered to be the best, no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the sworn and puzzling propositions are created, which can be created by machine translation, that this technology can still no longer be replaced by human translators. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often t T-shirts or pockets, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood nothing."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. but by large companies or by the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto hopefully use a serious source for their translation in the future.</seg>

<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan Tour, since 2014 the workshop of mobile audio studios go directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were headed by the Pedagogues David Hodges who lives in Montreal and Quebec with ten Cree-communities and then working together with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in discussions topics such as" cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-sufficiency, or whatever comes to mind. "</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska."</seg>

<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation is sung, the refrain is sung in Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop group who gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the strophe is at your disposal, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>

<seg id="750">"the coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the sinaloa-cartel, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent attack, someone looks at the dream or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"there are behind every body, behind each bone in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican message portal Animal Político is called the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "" (German: "" with the drug holesale life "") to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories of people working in the struggle between enforcement authorities and cartels.

<seg id="774">"" "we must not only show the faces of those who face fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the brittle and the government."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas.</seg>

<seg id="777">"KYHB, a writer of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that we should never consider violence as normal, regardless of what type it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensation of journalism I have been known for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come by a newspaper of newspaper every day, and see the front pages with pictures, which actually only came from a textbook for criminology or from actors of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the one, the raised or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-year cousin thinks that he is big. and it's not normal that people listen songs about the" heroism "of the offenders, when they pass through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, that is, as if they were those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they may have something like that."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The Tatennia of men is incredibly for me if the death of six people and the paving of 43 students in a neighboring village are therefore justified that they were located.</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to talk, that they are spared by such tragedies, if they are not stirred and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post of" four months of blackmail in main city distributions: like a family with threats, until they were destroyed by their business until they were not only destroyed the business, but also their family apart. "</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of it never ends, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again, if you are alone."</seg>

<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the further we are removed, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">It included its report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they deduce or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days, whether crying my deep-rooted feelings would be dissolving, but the answers is no, because I have forgotten how you are crying. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the post "The forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of violence opened."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was assassinated by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How about it in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make a egg cooks, tortillas warm and 'Chichi' for the babies makes those with him. this is his name for the preparation of the vial of water, sugar and milk powder. "</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he said to him that his mother disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has been over two years ago, when he had only a couple of blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father had been shot by armed men out of a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born the situation in Juárez saw this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as an violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of the Morality according to the public safety and government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecutor of 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the cut 8,5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundred thousand stories that organised organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Just a few stories live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those that we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "," Animal Político 2015 was launched in 2015, the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trade which has tormented the country in the last four decades. "</seg>

<seg id="835">"over the years, the same photo was recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but not with it in the context of related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the Nigerian villages Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Yewitnesses reported dramatically from atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and stores were burned down and corpses were burned in streets and bushes.</seg>

<seg id="842">"many were smashed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite pictures the following period could be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unsolved but the army protector in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to win Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image from the DR Congo again emerged as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2.000 people took place two days in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>

<seg id="852">"another step further bring personal comments such as this example, the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media related to arguments."</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their Posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of Indian origin, or generally used as an adjective". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" Kalar "or", "(in burial script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radicalist movements of the word has given an extremely tight connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort to fight, hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on his platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Kalar'Kalar may normally be associated with racism but the word itself does not call itself automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed for his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with fundamental meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmically also 'calar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words such as' Kalar Pae '(spreaded),' Kalar oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooky Aung Kaung explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was erased today because he enthused the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they knew how he could relieve his back pain by doing a word."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the set ku la -" healing "(ku) + the fragment (la) on Burmically - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"in Win Ham is the opinion that she may reduce visas, radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical, before it all posts to spread racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is filtered the Word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatic dism is not understood what you write to Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar Pae "" (spreadout). "</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that this trickery nationalists spread, the hate speech, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now it is time to circumcised its nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all, the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords often start a Katz- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the zenly word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described, as Facebook started to delete his postings, when he wanted to communicate his friends only that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail from Facebook was removed and sent to me the light, post and parts of contents for 24 hours because the post" Facebook community has not been kidnapped. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts of people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against hate-hate facalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they started with no local context or technical support and have forbidden words such as" "chair" "or" "inheritance curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they didn't try to report the falsibly dissolved Posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they have had a great turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship offered a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make himself using Facebook funny and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posting will be taken from the net."</seg>

<seg id="1480">She tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and they have made them at the same time ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in her discussion, was women who did not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided to have chosen this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"according to their husbands, the name of her husbands did not speak out loud, is a man who pleaded all the liability and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman is respected her husband and wish him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this, is considered to be back as a woman without morals."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is rooted as deeply rooted that we never have thought about this discussion to this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini wanted to have never called by the name to her husband, to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini is told:</seg>

<seg id="1492">"internash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should name him from now on his name."</seg>

<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "never before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then asked them all," If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the break of a centuries-old tradition, in the married women never to speak the name of their husbands.

<seg id="1501">Rohini is told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during all the exercise, it was just before moving, a different decided to dismiss the whole aned frustration against him and his family by hiding him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenaline rush about it, with an ancient Brother broken, the females decided that they would actually attempt at home their husbands in the name."</seg>

<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put the women into the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">A different club member chose to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-in-law they provoke, she was afraid and said that there was an error."</seg>

<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports as women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the castor red spot on the forehead, which indicates the spouse:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnored spot if he was doing it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs and I heard him to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped entirely, but my, they are now in a better position, even to choose him in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip for every discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make the women take care of who could hear," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"during the last months she celebrated their own birthdays with cakes, they danced and cheeks and spoke about things that they had never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have known about some things, for example as our identities at our husbands, have never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne by their marriage only Saris.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people it was okay, but some wanted to have a Salwas-Kurta, a broad shirt over a pants; they do not have dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of your own clothes-choice, morals connected to the Saris and much more, jewellery duini their own pair of curtas (Oberinhibit) into a discussion round, so the women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can carry jeans and Rohini is safe to make it happen."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion was changed, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming to roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then heard again to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and are not other members of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now contribute to each time Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>

<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home and told other people about what we talk about and what we do.</seg>

<seg id="1699">"however, it defends the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants, Europe or Latin America cross, some places will be announced for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, he is on the border with Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- Jold daughter, a small woman with a corals pink Brillenquell and golden earrings in teddy bears form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is born, Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mom Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) has become an aim for Africans and Haitian's who are on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has rather no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with meal, crumble walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some of them have already slept on cardboard."</seg>
<seg id="1912">I would like to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medicines that they can not pay them, they massaged them with a balsam, accompanied by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, is before a short time."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"Sebastiao Family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a joghurche) positional with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to do normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a famous name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest out of Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitian and Africans often travel together the way and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp from Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of his companion was Michelet previously lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weakened, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Busticket after tiresp.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we will never leave them again," "he smiling." we will always stay in touch. "</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Mrs Ramírez tells that their guests can send their often text messages, when they are gone to grind them or to tell her about the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but their guests have brought it to cook chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through tapestula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>

<seg id="1938">It is polishing and has noted that the Bustickets are sold to many African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitian."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchenette outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests make through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "" I have experienced what they experience. "</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>

<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants, who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to compress money out of him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, a single-minded, has offered him its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family lives still there and she is trying to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>

<seg id="1952">In the courses the travelers consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs Ramírez seems happy that their house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken from Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time inside; sometimes he moves to his canvas, to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but what one can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house which has been part of them since 1967; the year, in which Israel ended up his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family were forced to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as felahyeen (e.g.: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for now six years, Hdaib has been a passionate majority who faces the conservative majority and asks its old proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality, and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian people, but he also calls out the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only be found in his hometown Amman Relevance, but also in cities that from Damascus to Saa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as a person who is not limited by boundaries in his mind, and he can feel his own statement by human beings who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not open it, he swept up against the US American foreign policy a special disappearance."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas, anything with his identity as" Palestinian "Palestinian people", "even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine before."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own living conditions so," stresses Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he shutteth a man in water. it is the Holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordarian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sensing hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically they speak of a warm coffee and the snake of the Kent cigar in the nose in the first place of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when one throws a view into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, one simply avoids basic things to do - as in the public during Ramadan) - to land not in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior of Jordaniens has a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary groups, who support the Islamic Action Front - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontary is contradictory to the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the S & D spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the Skaners."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be more dangerous activism who constitutes the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila saw the jordan people as" "progressive supporters of human rights" "who continue to appoint themselves" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement might not be easy-to-end rhetoric but actually a clear and clear reality in Jordan, which clearly expresses in Hdaibs plant."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib's traditional gender standards to be Leif by giving his vision of the fate of Arab women, the predominant sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of a clearly lower-known woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of" Honorary murders "" - the inofficial outside. "</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch, according to its culmination, the number of volunteers in the year 2016 reached its culmination; however, Jordan is still missing to support the women, the victims tried Mordes or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for crime against corruption in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence, and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family, that the woman is nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is well-known, but also not heinous subjects that were long as tabu in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib indubitable that his work is politically, however, that he is his music, who is full of explicit attacks on sexuality, freedom and expression, not separate politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"to me, politics was convened," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and in" "Ghareeb" "is the focus on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are politically politically, can be pursued further."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words," what you want "- be it belief or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he notices that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still strongly committed in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib brought an interview for the popular jordan OnlineProgramme Roya to later notice that his comments from the context were torn down, twisted and his opinion turned to censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a processed version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib buys openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which remained in mind today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asked yourself: if Abu Nuwhat, who should later work once on behalf of the caliph, in the eighth century could write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordi not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemitic Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordan intelligence service was held by several former government members and members of the teaching network, with the rationale, they thought of based on comments in social media which coincides with deep in the land of rooted corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of what is the concert of Hdaibs, according to that, only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan-Spaniards."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan is now a gig, but the path of progress - it consists of slow, principled and inner changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the jordan society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreams not only dreamed his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it to experience."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will help with music, art and literature of genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs, streams and artificial species. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until that time, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resist."</seg>

<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"they assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many regions of Tohokus. another theory asserted that the festivities, the drums and the dancing over more than one thousand years have come across the northeast, to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to force the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the" "love message to guerrilla warfare," which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve. "</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who know we?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel spread out to offer affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"precisely this question went to the two young Colombian activists, Leonardo Párraga from the Stiftung Bogota and Cristian Palacios, from the Young-Youth Foundation, no longer from the head and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people to write" "guerrilla warfare."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her land was a place of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla Movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was considered the undermark of peace treaty, as significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Colombian, there is a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warfare, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetorrhetoric and, around the clock, they have to integrate their weapons again into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society again, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases had accustomed to guerrilla warfare, it must now be able to record them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian people join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guerrilla warfare to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warfare - who will then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter to reconciliation emerged on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, who took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian have the opportunity to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"he explained that we love the people who love, on Valentine's Day of thousands of love letters, but those forgot that they need much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he continues to share his love with people this year, which needed the urgent popularity."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan, letter full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and to build up a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history of a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, in the context of the campaign more than 2000 letters were collected."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I have never imagined that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogota traveled into the camp to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done before in order to counterincrease the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of protection from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between, told the policy knowledge and Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former fighters led me to the camp of the Guerilla-fighter."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cammer" "(a kind of hut, where the guillillary struggles live), I saw a guerrilla warfare that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid of responding, as next to him on the bed was a MGL pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the bush."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said it anyway, and said," "hello, what are they doing right?" "he answered," I answer a letter that someone has written me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life, someone has written something so beautiful, so I answered that." then I suddenly had the tears over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embrace him very seriously and set me next to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was pity the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighters and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from the Hungertod." I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society there, which is waiting with open arms for us."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC also declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how to develop social injustice from the state to the whole Colombian people, we can contribute to creating a political party in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard before and had no electoral law, and recognizing that the people that I have often seen as monster and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings were turned out by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - even those who killed, and so much damage, can bring us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Kolumbians was prophesied that after the disarmament peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality gives inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are ready to protest to the weapons and to protest for their rights. this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from the FARC are now putting on peace, to a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2249">"they have brought a Monster to the World"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Translady, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since her childhood, she felt that she was in fact a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was born, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Cheetected of the sexually infusion of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"out of fear for her life, they passed over to the USA in the end."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer heroin at a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone took my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a acquaintance from Dagestan, a transwife who put in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"I tried to help her, made someone, of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of mine. then there are no men more in Chechnya with the following message:" then there are no men more in Chechnya who can eliminate these shame?

<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents were made by WhatsApp."</seg>

<seg id="2265">I knew the person not.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I just know that there was a young man, no thirty years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and awoke in the end again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got it all along and started to cry.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I was driving that I had two keywords in my right lung wing.</seg>

<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name, but the doctor arose and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office, I got it to do with fear; it was a Muslim, a casian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he was respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightclub.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">Those demanded to return to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd claims: some said to me, I had to prove it by opening up without the roads lead; others wanted me to have changed my sex in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, and Photoshop."</seg>

<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>

<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she fell a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with darkened windows and a numerical shield with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it was clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends inspecting the numeric signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you leave?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give her name but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something incredible."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without having to register, without ID, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment, when I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I didn't ask a message:" you don't believe, you will be in security, just because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which Hotel du steckst. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still have contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the gender equality. however, this is a taboos."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kaucasian elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I desire, this sailor barrier can not overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I am always saying that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chatting with camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person that they remember from their past - thus to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the time I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who has sent one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, he was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives before, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require evidence that the so-called" honor "has experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there even more gay men in this secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine saying that there were just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then most of all those who have no wealthy relatives, or have been dropped by their relatives to put Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there, so that they can present them later than terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be converted, you will show your body on television and claim them, they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not just gone, but specifically surfaced to radiate itself."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a failure or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just zipped someone the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">"he says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after their beard grew."</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new about them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them off.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was by himself as these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"but until now, they were not introduced as bandits, there has been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise one could not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"know if this persecution and performances of people who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, have already been in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I had my hair always long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe in front of 2003 I was already known in Grosny as I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "civil society", "but we finally returned to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored lashes, carried eyesjeans and short Tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of the sharia has never bent me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"there was a place in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny, where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole town knew about it; they knew why men, young people, there met."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been compensated.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spotte not over the unhappiness of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it often to children if those who make themselves funny through sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply have their eyes in front of you because they believed, they are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never compensated and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace be kept?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister 2005, he began to speak on his morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us, but above all about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel how people started in the city to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had smiles and logged in, regarded you at one time with Argwohn."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I was able to feel how the situation in the Republic is constantly worse."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't digest much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>

<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is aloud.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"thus nature, this is pure nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechnyan, who want to prophesy with foam before mouth, that there is no sbumps on them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have what is the cabardiner, who have the Russians also who are on the whole planet - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I am from there, so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear."</seg>

<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and during Ramadan - live with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many think of Transidentity to men who love men, and they believe that you can change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a chest."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two distinct things - two different kinds of feeling, to be accurate, different lifestyle settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed me for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I'm here so personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri, originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a Feminist, a lot of women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought well by scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women today despite equal education are still less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"that women are still under strict observation, if it's about doing what they are doing with their body."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later in various sectors of life on a smooth roof, and that discrimination based on sex still passes through the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is conscious of me and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I am double and triple including.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I come to a skin colour, in racism, on black CIS women, on black borders, women, on black borders, women, and verbal abuse, on which kind we have been physically, seelically and verbal abuse, both in and outside the feminist movement, decide to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless all agree that women - all women should come together to uplift their voices and sing 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about it in addition to sexualized violence an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or moreover, that black women and women from other ethnicities and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girl and girls with a migration background of the school are referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence and violence, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand I want to have all women, all men, and all men, neither skin colour, the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot consider myself a black woman in whose center is the white woman who refuse to consider the injustices in their thinking that relate to the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I'm exhausted and will no longer fight my membership in a white feminiist oriented sphere, which always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sognner said 1851 in her speech," "I am not a woman?" and I also refuse to sustain an ideology, in which the black woman is a human and marginalized being. "</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb through cultural expropriation our customs and customs, to advance its egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer attempt to raise white women the importance of abundance of skin colour and sex. for some of them continue to remain the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different countries at home, and boundaries of white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I invite it to dissolve myself full of feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas, and enter into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Classa Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanew: as we can regain ourselves (e.g.: Africa Womanism: how we can ourselves regain ourselves by making ourselves completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, seelic, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered that make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after they read these lines, please ask about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I existed."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman drew its display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the Teufellows of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women are refund at all times, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence, prove to be victims of violence at all times."</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content of 1 beats and statistic 2 Unvisible Missions and a judicial system that nothing underscored 3 of Paraguay laws: good approach to lack of punching and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really misleading, says Myrian González, a research assistant at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay." "there are various statements and reports, but not even ansate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are very alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 at the District Apostle N9600 ads went on account of domestic violence. at 70% of it we went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 ads for domestic violence at the peace. also here 86% of the ads of women came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said they were physically misleading, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan women's ministerin Ana Baiardi will actually appear only a few of these crimes also actually displayed." on every woman, which will be refunded in Paraguay because of psychic mitigation, are 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman, which will be refunded due to physical mitigation, are two women who do not do so, stated at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since the women's genocide in Paraguay is not an own criminal offences, the prosecution authorities can not adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">Only until August 2016 were journalists at least 12 cases of women's genocide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she did not want this, but then after. this should repent it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years, she carried out the mental violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never imagined that I would once again become victims of misleading.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I have read earlier this, I always thought that only women were happening, who are mistaken, because they deceive themselves of violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana useless social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, they wrote contributions on Facebook, in which they described his insults and different attacks during their two year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of misleading."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook-users asked Mariana, why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have a certain complicity to it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which does not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner has been misleading."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the network Yo te CREO (" "I believe you"), which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse. "</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">You do that which many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"your wealthy partner, it finally managed to convince them that it was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads in the authorities stayed with no result and also of their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a trial against their former partner who developed into an unsearchable legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country, in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of their former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay laws: good approach, lack of implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws that are very good but not applied."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed resources will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this entry from Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reported about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant produced by NASA Astronauts in Space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"Morton's work was put on work only by his own ingenuity and the question, how many salatants can get, boundaries."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but in the beginning of the 2000s, he believed that more and more salads were patented and that he therefore could not continue to use them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green, or arded sheets."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more of such patents have been signed on more and more plants like corn or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still a salad, but it is now longer necessary because his work is more and more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when I lie in a river a rock brock, to which I have to paddle."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to make this now, but it is a break with the culture tradition," he says. "I think that these patents on salads go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they withstand before dish, no one can breed any new salatsorties, because all the features are already patented, and so he tries to refine those features."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the U.S. and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Roman salt in the" greenhouse "of the station and ate. there is tested, whether plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement originated from the IT field, and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "open source" "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" "open source" "software, the alternatives to copyrighted software available."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was established in life to ensure that some plant species are protected and, not being protected as intellectual property, and so for plant breeders are permanently available."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the framework of the initiative, in short Ossi, US breeders can commit to commit themselves that others can be cultivated by them seed-free."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and can sell it." "open source" "breeders only allow others to breed their seed, and it does not immediately appeal - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member, Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays an important role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to make the latter not or only little by working seed with natural resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg stresses that the" "Open Source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants. "</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants might be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "who wants to purchase good, locally and sustainably producing fusions in the global agricultural industry, it should also know that the way it is offered in peasant markets, it should also know that the way that this vegetables is bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"nourishment without seeds, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to putting others their seed well freely available. thus their action is opposed to patenting seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi Supports argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available natural pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material that is thus always restricted, uncontrollable."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has been engaged in her PhD thesis with genealogy and their availability. she found out that about a third of all carton characteristics are protected as intellectual property, thus it is usable for plant breeders or not only."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suggests that mass-in plants like wheat are patented in a larger style as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants will be bred that they are targeted - from such, through which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments to flourish and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeder is increasing by increasingly more patents. genetic diversity is currently unnecessary than ever since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail recognises Monsanto-Speaker in Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four comrades and the cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States set out the company for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it contradicts the view that intellectual property promote other breeder, since" patents and protection of plant reproductive innovations encourage innovation. "a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibits innovations not but also encourages them to be provided by the public more material and know-how.</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that different: 20 years to wait, until a patent has no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for such a long time, in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one could have lost the struggle already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"but the main argument for Morton is however, that genetic resources have always been a general well and it should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives have not been attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers ease their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what motivates us, and it will make us impossible if we can not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton does not interfere with the concept to make plant peculiarity:" "we do not create the characteristics themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants themselves form them out and as breeders have finally no idea of how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US-State Oregon and Ossi board, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" "who is bred a variety, and also bred its own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monocultures, for their cultivation of massaging Herbizide, bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is exactly spotlessly." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than any Monsanto have) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeder by the prevention of plant patented innovative would:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies, the patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a couple of years ago," "he says." "with a patent is one 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it very easy to do in my opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"while the United States seem to be a leader in the" "Open Source" "cattery, but now the concept spreads rapidly all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "") describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, an "open source" seed program. for receiving the seed of traditional farm animals working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties. "</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source 'seeds and to sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agreements works on an" "Open Source" "license, which ultimately is a formative and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeder in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeder differ from country to country, but the Ossi obligation cannot simply become one of one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive powers of the European Union, the European Commission, says that conventional plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent policy, the patents on conventional plants are allowed."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on" "open source" "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and seed companies from all in East Africa to learn something about the" Open Source "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for hivos' programme for" "Open Source" "seed systems states that the organization is currently preparing a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, for which planned next year of the official start signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development organisation USC Canada and the Action Group to erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity around the world to publish a seed map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essens - a composite of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report published. in this, it represents the possibility that farmers have the opportunity to exchange and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply is emphasized by seed for sustainable food systems - a connection by the Luby of Ossi that will soon become more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has especially taken care of where and how something grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," Luby. "we are trying to make people clearest that even more behind their foods are."</seg>
