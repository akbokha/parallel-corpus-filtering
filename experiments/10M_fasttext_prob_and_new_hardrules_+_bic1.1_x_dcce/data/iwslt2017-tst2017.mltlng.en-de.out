this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times .
&quot; long before anyone had heard from Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the N@@ SA listened to illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation where the CIA literally handed down dra@@ fts for an atomic bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds like , you can read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapters did not fell ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government was determined against R@@ isen and called it to call its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train he became a symbol of the pattern of government , whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First constitu@@ tions , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get these information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they offer . &quot;
&quot; so when the government ra@@ ged with R@@ isen , he did something that many brave re@@ por@@ ters did before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had for years indications that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the Government of R@@ isen were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porter and springs can hide less and less .
&quot; instead of bringing and rel@@ ay to statements , that could also handle his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so , the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his phone are secre@@ tly concerned , &quot;
&quot; just as his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even travel @-@ references with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ons of the supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is just one of many cases . &quot;
President Obama promised to protect the whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers . but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him .
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we set the press work for the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more and more possibilities to comp@@ ose all out . &quot;
&quot; however , just as technology of the government permits the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can take this from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that has not yet been written as R@@ isen his book and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source over@@ hau@@ l system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the internet master@@ mind , which was developed by us Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and today is today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; to send an e @-@ mail , go to a news page , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; this is then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective message agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot find more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would be requested would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is to ensure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to judge mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; who wants to report about ab@@ norm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers , and of crowded hospitals . or the next environment @-@ workers , the alarm to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t suggests . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der , war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crime , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest acquisition of history was released . &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer of Global W@@ ays around one statement . &#93; This week we were killed by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse of the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands prime minister has res@@ igned .
also there are reports that a ally det@@ er of the brutal Syrian dictator@@ ator B@@ ar @-@ Assad &apos;s Bashar al @-@ Assad in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed to lead a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin , through a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous upon the next release and the next un@@ covered documents .
now it sounds like the P@@ lot of an agency code or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems to be crying out of you , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we go what to do ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global W@@ ays , these revelations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are to be used to hide and conce@@ al their assets -- something that we have been discussing and enth@@ used for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people this whole world appears very confusing , and it is hard to understand how this tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ ger .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably because there have been no prominent American Americans , which occurred in this revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which this tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ bag has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a backup from the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections in the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is such that one needs less information in some US states to set less information to create a company than to get a libr@@ arian card . &quot;
&quot; this type of in@@ transparent in the US has allowed employees of school @-@ districts , school children . &quot;
it has allowed frau@@ ds to a@@ vert especially sus@@ cep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that all concerns us .
here at Global W@@ ays we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
&quot; so , we sent a c@@ apped investig@@ ators in the offices of 13 lawyers companies in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself as a African minister , who want to bring money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; sho@@ ok us really , that all of us made suggestions on a lawyer of our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ meetings . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course anyone handed over money to us . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as an attack .
it is not about a single lawyer who has made suggestions on our inter@@ c@@ apped investig@@ ator proposals .
&quot; it is not about a single leaders , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to det@@ er this kind of behavior .
&quot; this might sound very much , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a secure optim@@ ist , I certainly see that things have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen before increasing transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron in the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has captured in central regi@@ sters at national level , who truly is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is going back here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global W@@ ays this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who become angry when they see , how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ hunters . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , which will get up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to stop through laws this type of inflation . &quot;
&quot; together we can finish the transparency , which now enables these kinds of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I once kidn@@ apped almost and in the trunk of a red ma@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ f@@ ale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my artwork .
he was alone in the city and made straight a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where s@@ ess thou today ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing even worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know it yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleep place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says , he would go to peace @-@ grain , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I will not kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a ma@@ ze ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have a air mat@@ ernity . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; said a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ red to the ceiling and thought : &quot; &quot; Oh dear ! what was I built there ? &quot;
a wild@@ fire sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , to@@ ti@@ lt at the door , and shut up my bedroom . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork , which he had bought from me , depends today in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe people , who were sold to me in childhood as strangers , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air @-@ mat , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; we make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate draws up and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all the hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have survived how we could make something to do . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and each morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and built so &quot; air mat@@ rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mat on wood floors .
they found it super and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we passed our last guest and opened the door to the castle , star@@ ring Brian and I felt forward . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came into rolls .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether one could make it a business concept .
&quot; so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; &quot; we would like to create a website , on which people post publicly pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room , whose doors can be passed when you visit . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite wild foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they are not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a shop , the stran@@ ger permits , in apartments of other people to sleep . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you feel on the things that one can do well . we could des@@ nen . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just looks and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to build objects , but now we wanted to create through design immense confidence between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a rehear@@ sal , what degree of confidence we stra@@ ined . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your phone into the hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock that you un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your remote mobile phone your left seat .
&quot; this silent flight from panic , which you now feel right now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time . &quot;
&quot; because the only thing , which is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the bul@@ lock of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
the majority sense the responsibility .
&quot; so , most guests feel when they are somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
only once so , who now actually has Al Gor@@ es cell ? &quot;
could you declare on Twitter that he channel for the president of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail at this experiment ?
what if your neighbour would have imagined only once with his name ; if he could have told wh@@ ence he comes how his dog or his children are called ?
&quot; imagine you would have 150 assess@@ ments which all say , &quot; &quot; he can really feel very well un@@ locked phones ! &quot;
how would you feel like you would like to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ designed feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to prevent negative assess@@ ments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their reviews before we put it online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprisingly , we trust the people most who are most like us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social disp@@ arity .
exciting is to add to the call of an individual -- in our case by moving departments .
&quot; if you have less than three assess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation of similarities .
thus the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preference .
&quot; furthermore , we learned that confidence depends on how much you can get from . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; when one tells too little , such as &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells us a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your apartment ! I make with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds up hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
&quot; what we had not reck@@ oned , was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first of all : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third : a need , which was not covered before . &quot;
for us the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have in@@ allowed parties celebrated or houses devast@@ ated .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it does hurt if I just think of it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the attacks was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve .
&quot; fortunately , from the 123 million the nights had a fraction of only a fraction ever encountered . &quot;
for people are familiar to each other .
&quot; when trust works , there can be wonderful people . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the needed surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travellers looking to heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel , who save one life even though they don &apos;t know at all . &quot;
&quot; they drive one in the hospital in the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want to feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
they can even stay longer without charge extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so naturally not every stay is starting .
but these relationships behind the pure money trans@@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money trans@@ actions fit together ?
it is here to make an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now simply to name &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the item will not do justice . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
humans lay part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is compared to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic . &quot;
what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place that one would like to wait a group there Ans@@ äs@@ si@@ ger to wait a thoroughly rin@@ se and to show a bar in a pub that one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking of a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would create apartments from scratch on the inter@@ conn@@ ect@@ edness ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would have the thoughts of the common part ?
I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and failure .
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already been started . many parking places that included the government , &quot;
were now residents offered . students who were looking for a job
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were educated . there were incub@@ ators programs started ;
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone the night 7@@ 85 000 people will be host to guest at a foreign or even host .
the idea seems to be so crazy as it was brought to us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
&quot; hospitality , there was also previously . &quot;
there were already similar websites .
so why did our work work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of the trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I find that amazing , &quot;
down@@ right down .
I have to think about it if a red Maz@@ da is passing by me .
we of course know that design can not solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or oppressed , a bra@@ in@@ la@@ undering , a terrorist attack ? &quot;
or just a delay at the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media folks are the same as I do .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims negative .
studies show : the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslims , it &apos;s great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
a se@@ ag@@ itation @-@ gym @-@ fan@@ atics in
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual muscle . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to have decided .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , as some of my friends , but as a muscle . I decided to bear the hi@@ j@@ ab my head . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ ek was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and indeed to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tainable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have been with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , I thought , asked in question , doub@@ ted and believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the grain .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the weeping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever have the feeling that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in essence the &quot; Egyptian American Dream &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had dinner at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ ab@@ sen@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , aircraft flew in buildings , people sp@@ las@@ hed from buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into indi@@ gn@@ ation quickly .
why should you do something ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u turned me the deeds of others by a citizen in a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start the creation . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we were silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as a muscle . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard that I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; B@@ lei@@ gh in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ ed you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw this extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held for Muslims , demol@@ ished in the Free and proposed . &quot;
there were really brands on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not really right .
because people who had attacked this country have attacked our country .
I rep@@ lied the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love issues . &quot;
&quot; there are the accus@@ ations , which are hard . &quot;
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to susp@@ end Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ icious tumor can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the US , but an essential organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are inventor and teacher and Olympi@@ as and Olympi@@ as .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; it may keep some parking free , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people of other faith toler@@ ant , and to show greater civil participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not al@@ loc@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ alized in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radi@@ alization process , one has noted that it starts online . as a first , the person will believe from their church , even by their family , so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who desp@@ ise their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to stop people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
finally a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Koran .
&quot; as a muscle , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do anything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves to their imagination , if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups are claim@@ ing their ideology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when one throws a look at it , it does not drives them what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she had imagined to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought her wrath to her mind , her sense of injustice in the world , it would only be in trouble . &quot;
&quot; of nothing inspired and something that had given sense to her mind , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alisation through extre@@ mi@@ sts which you spoke a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and its church .
&quot; instead of replacing them for their anger , he showed up constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mosque , keep them to join the IS . &quot;
this was a glimpse of how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy on our thoughts ?
a study -- actually indicate several neuro@@ scientific studies -- when we fear that happen at least three things .
&quot; we rather accept an authorized government system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : when a test@@ bed has been presented , in which negative about Muslims , they vote rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just a academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims from above - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two constitu@@ encies .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it can be a tool for manipulation of the public to compens@@ ate the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
handling of Muslims is an early warning .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear turns to all of us . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of coll@@ ectiv@@ es , it is not just about to explain yourself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of them went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
&quot; he was at the dental Faculty , talented , promising , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , generous man , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his life . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; when is that of my breasts , such a sealed young man has become ? &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she killed , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , which was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after he had posted an expression against Muslim on his facebook page . &quot;
he enjoyed eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism may not only be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or we stayed safe at home ?
&quot; we felt it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about how America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the nur@@ sery , we went quiet , with high @-@ pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , went out my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked himself and was welcomed to our guests , because half of the gathered Christians were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , believers , believers and non @-@ believers who have come to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
in that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and pre@@ ju@@ dice pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what are you choosing at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you go on number sure ?
or will you connect to those that mean : we are better than those .
thank you .
thanks nice !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have made a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say that you might think that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with deep mind , therefore an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive you . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual how it is allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the greatest ever done study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for cra@@ fting , is just about to become a billion cap . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dron@@ es . this is made in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air package , in our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of air@@ machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; through inter@@ connecting air devices , high speed and speed up to narrow space . &quot;
you can also build up @-@ to @-@ date structures .
they have learned to wear loads with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to present you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system of aut@@ op@@ om , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynam@@ ical Tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new localization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a member of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room where calculations on board determine what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available at the highest image . for example , start &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a device , which tries to beat two flies with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other starter motors , it is efficient in the forward @-@ forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the Star@@ r@@ gs it can float , and it has a great advantage when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of h@@ eck@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind ar@@ ches .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air conditioner no matter in which position the optimum position reg@@ ained and the performance by practicing can be improved .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often represent fundamental abstract issues that penet@@ rate the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the petty @-@ possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that gather together in order to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilot @-@ controlled flight devices could fly , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear suspension . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
this is the mon@@ op@@ inner that served mechanical remote remotely . it was invented in front of short fiction .
&quot; it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cla@@ p , hinges and cross @-@ rests , no further actu@@ ators or chec@@ kl@@ ist surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in the inside , it happens very much so that it can be stable and can move freely in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ p@@ eck@@ ers . to get it to the fly , I have to properly throw it correctly . &quot;
&quot; the probability to throw it correctly if you watch all that is low , so I show you a video that filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in genius , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thus , he gets the ability of the ability to be . &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is turned or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; some of them can be found in models , the rest is lear@@ ns directly at the fly . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely secure and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two prop@@ eller machines .
this turns in the clo@@ ck@@ wise sense
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ru@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by driving a half .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one disc bread -- and equi@@ p them with localization technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where in the room she is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine is there that you want to become a flying lamp@@ shade at Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the reward lies in the development and the creation of the creation .
&quot; it serves as memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures , to shape them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1.9 billion years ago , in a very distant galax@@ y two black holes become ever faster , you walked as the mass of tri@@ m in a tenth part in a pure energy . &quot;
this short moment she lit brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they didn &apos;t put your energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into the space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events at first time .
1.9 billion years ago was a majority of life on Earth .
&quot; since then the earth has brought some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Saul , people and -- God stand up to us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group particularly gr@@ aceful -- R@@ ai Weiss , from the M@@ IT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - have a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise for example due to col@@ li@@ di@@ zing black holes . &quot;
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people knew it as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation was co @-@ funded .
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ rium observ@@ atory observ@@ atory . &quot;
in the follow @-@ time the precision of LIG@@ O could considerably increase the recognition performance enormously improved .
therefore one calls him Advanced LIG@@ O .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LIG@@ O was started for a last test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , pus@@ hes the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ di@@ zing black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my to@@ d@@ ill &apos;s father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
all of what I had worked is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es to theoretical physi@@ cists of black holes and their through observ@@ atories like LIG@@ O measurable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ row in the texture of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content is stretched in a direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; in the illustration , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for relevance theory often lead to a correct al@@ ber@@ ish dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , everyone was stretched out of us at the rise of the waves and pun@@ ched . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ oes after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st of W@@ here@@ fore the LIG@@ O employees are crazy for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic time . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; boxes Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LIG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves in the following : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
but physi@@ c@@ ist are educated and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome .
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LIG@@ O . Scott is happy , LIG@@ O would be more than one eye than one eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a w@@ avel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial coatings , the size of your phones . &quot;
this is quite handy . because so you can create an image or a map of things by watching the light coming from several points of coming light around you .
&quot; in tones , it is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a w@@ avel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean particularly much to you : &quot;
the face of your child about .
&quot; instead , we listen according to certain properties such as clay and height , rhythm and volume to close the history behind it . &quot;
&quot; now speaking just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks her . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can provide you with no simple pictures of objects in space .
&quot; but by having regard to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can hear their stories . &quot;
at least there are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert shaft patterns in Sh@@ all , we can speak the All literally . &quot;
&quot; the gravity too loud , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , how my colleague Scott has already worked very long . &quot;
&quot; S@@ H : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , p@@ ant@@ elop@@ es simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same p@@ ant@@ elop@@ es with an additional sound @-@ change . this sounds like this : Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu ! &quot;
it is a sort of movement of movement bearing in the w@@ av@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LIG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ al noise &#93; Jem@@ ini , who knows what he has to hear , realize this as a sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which about as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the most dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each one hundred times a second , before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding meaning of LIG@@ O .
&quot; LIG@@ O has a completely new way to investigate the universe , as it was never before possible . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the All and the invisible .
&quot; much in all , we can -- virtually or basically -- not see . &quot;
&quot; a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ ser@@ ene stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about this .
&quot; the exciting physical processes are to happen at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ licon . &quot;
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it were transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , as the urine is covered by its own desc@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; using the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before , and of which we don &apos;t have any idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LIG@@ O was immediately found in the first attempt things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at the M@@ IT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O @-@ Project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that bring black holes , like LIG@@ O they are observed , are the dinosau@@ rs of the Universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are to say the sauce for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LIG@@ O gives us a completely different angle of view at all , on the creation of the stars and ultimately it on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as brave as possible .
&quot; thanks to LIG@@ O , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; one year long I would say to all &quot; yes &quot; , &quot; before which I feared . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous to say me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid , I feared my fear . &quot;
&quot; to keep my fear , speeches , my social fear -- d@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes that my life changed deeply , on an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls from in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kittens , I need milk for my beak @-@ terrace . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; of a new way of life in my family . from there I hur@@ ry to play with them as soon as you ask me to ask for . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am happy . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an intrigu@@ ing side @-@ effect : only recently I was completely understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sa@@ ws for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things out of you awake to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ate TV . I producing television .
I do television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television programme can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days four shows four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ ens , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America I run my television series on Thursday night .
around the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I myself created , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans of camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , which burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who still does it ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so all of you who work so hard if you now speak a company , a country or a household , take me seriously when I say I say , I understand that I don &apos;t just want to dream about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m born in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land out of nothing .
&quot; it is when I set up troops , as a m@@ old I on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as for example , you have a high sound , lie@@ der a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sum . &quot;
there is so a change in me when working works well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could always drive for it . &quot;
&quot; many people take , when I talk to them the bu@@ zz , that I &apos;m talking about writing , that the writing is pleasure . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but the bu@@ zz I began when I began working with television production when I began to work and to work and to work together , I discovered this thing , that sums , this energy . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have so a bu@@ zz , then you cannot strive differently from size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling that may not be different , than to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of the failure .
I do not know it .
&quot; I know only , that I am not for the failure , and I know only that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I will only tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask it in question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more jobs , the more the more things simultaneously , the more things simultaneously , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work me . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land , which I create , the marathon , which I lead , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sums , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just that bu@@ zz ?
and then it stops the bu@@ zz .
&quot; revised , extended , extended , extended . &quot;
the sums stopped .
&quot; now , my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their mom is a single work@@ station . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; kittens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
it is the children of an Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums up . &quot;
the sums of the engine pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I don &apos;t loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , passed on weekends , no re@@ mor@@ ed , nothing deleg@@ ate , there is not on , with whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me there was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
&quot; so what to do , if what you do is doing the work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; Heu@@ le you out , stupid the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you are doing what you do is doing a teacher to be a painter , a father , a mother , and knows how to feel the bu@@ zz when you stop the bu@@ zz , if you stop the bu@@ zz , who is then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; listening to the song of my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress in &quot; a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says : &quot; &quot; Mama , mag@@ st du playing ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say NO to be aware of two things :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , they don &apos;t called me . &quot;
&quot; it is no longer called &quot; &quot; kittens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is it happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan am and my bu@@ zz , and here everything is changing my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , mag@@ st du playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters encounter it , we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the Sum@@ ming , I can do nothing but to match . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the land , which I create , the marathon , which I lead , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; all that exists in sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id caps , delicate voices , guard and the song in which it comes to slo@@ gans , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breath@@ ed .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and a energy panel comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums come slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the bu@@ zz , the working environment , the fix@@ tures , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums of money is . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not unemployed .
it depends on the pleasure .
real sums depend on love .
the bu@@ zz is the electricity that comes from living .
true sums of money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums may ignore the pressure of the story , which have reli@@ ed on performing tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
true sums is simple and original .
&quot; true sums of God is the voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed me God the false words , because what God told me that I am an Titan Go ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I make this a fixed rule so I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any debt .
&quot; it is a law , I have no choice . I do not have any other choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; play is not part of me , as they work . &quot;
the truth does hurt
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I am always working , because I love it . &quot;
I &apos;m rather at the workplace as a home .
&quot; this con@@ fession is painful , because what kind of man does rather work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I am . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan , &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , is none of them . &quot;
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden around , before and back , go back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ates soap bub@@ bles .
thereby I feel mostly rigid , absent and confused . &quot;
I always walk after my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe meets me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with games ?
you can also tell it ! let them always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you keep me for na@@ ï@@ ve for a t@@ agli@@ der .
&quot; you may well , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play a maximum of 15 minutes with me , until they are resour@@ ce@@ ful that they want something else . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ins or K@@ eks replaced me .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ ager all 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more requires not . &quot;
each can bring 15 minutes to the piece even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the kids will do . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my wellbeing , my world . it must not be the children , to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for his soul . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it is about pleasure
to play the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I sh@@ ading and I am there . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I was given up when I got my first TV show , when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to make myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my free time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I do not work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up , the energy flows up and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown melody , she ful@@ fills me and my soul . I pray to new ideas . I use it in full circle and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz ; the bu@@ zz is not me ... not anymore .
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my credit .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the bu@@ zz of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thankful for it . &quot;
&quot; it is a d@@ oll , that I am a Titan Poker . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and too more games .
&quot; and yet , I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire are still burning . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clearly my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land , which I create , the marathon , the v@@ ases , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sums , the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think things out of I awake you to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dream@@ y .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and too more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgery in .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon is it very frustrating that the brain , as opposed to other bodily organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I was working neuro@@ surgical treatment .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous system through various surgical measures .
&quot; certainly they have heard of one of the most popular , the &quot; &quot; field @-@ du@@ ster stimulation &quot; . &quot; it impl@@ anted an electro@@ de deeply in the brain to influence the schem@@ atics of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson that suffered from fierce tre@@ m@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was the captain of the doctor and worked out the day and night in the emergency .
often I cat@@ ered patients with skull @-@ bra@@ ins trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that at skull @-@ brain @-@ trau@@ mas the brain incl@@ ined and the skull @-@ like to be til@@ ted .
&quot; to save life , one has to dimin@@ ish the skull @-@ inner . &quot;
you sometimes need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
cells of a tissues to grow is comparable with quite small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve it thri@@ ve . &quot;
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many trials we managed to Jean @-@ François .
this he saw among his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the Bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ Less@@ ons that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform itself into every cell type of organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small n@@ ish of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising that this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
&quot; they never die , they are imm@@ or@@ tal . &quot;
but these cells hold different .
they divided slowly and after a couple of weeks they died even .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but kept differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand how they came .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ ine @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ hir@@ n@@ rin@@ se cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the separation of the brain .
but why do they stay to us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- by these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultiv@@ ate cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and then gently mark it to be able to pursue them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we impl@@ anted it to the reception of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist tran@@ spl@@ ant -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ gers .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we impl@@ ant these cells in normal brain tissues ? and what will happen if we impl@@ ant the same cells in corrupt brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we impl@@ anted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken up after a few weeks as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario we added a violation of and impl@@ anted exactly the same cells , and now the cells were preserved -- they washed away to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were impl@@ anted .
&quot; the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we were in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
&quot; so , we are using monkeys with a manual reaction . &quot;
they had to take for@@ age from a tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; when she had reached a stable skill level , we last in the motor cor@@ tex the hand@@ mot@@ or@@ ic area . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen by people , they recovered spontane@@ ously to some degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to relax with the help of sculp@@ tural bra@@ in@@ isms . they rest at some degrees as well as on the monkey .
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recreation , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey that recovered spontane@@ ously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not that precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we impl@@ anted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the stim@@ ul@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and later use them .
&quot; we can use them in other neurological models , for example with Park@@ inson . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant them in humans .
&quot; I really hope I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal itself . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that there are several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely recommend .
&quot; of course , the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being . &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get the permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take , until someone can get to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the authorisation of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it needs a long time to select patients to perform and evaluate treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi@@ centric study . &quot;
you have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thanks for your visit to TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the br@@ ittle plant , which it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable tissue .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ itation in Beijing have proven beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; indeed , democracy is w@@ aking up with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as Minister of Finance Ministers in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to be influenced by austerity , which have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my written friends , who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe in cooperation with me , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group an error , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defence democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies will be reported in one , our future dark and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently being threatened with our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; tw@@ ins summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt of debt , which throws its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all know the debt crisis , &quot;
but only a few recognize his Gem@@ ini .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the ver@@ tices and corporations , which are too anxi@@ ous to invest , where it would be productive and income , with which you need to wear the debt crisis and also take all the things that humanity urgently needed , for example &apos; green &apos; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months have been invested in the US , in England and in the euro zone , 3.4 tri@@ lli@@ on US dollars , in all the wealth produced products , such as industrial installations , machinery , office buildings , schools , tracks , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3,4 tri@@ lli@@ on US dollars sounds worth a lot of money until you interact with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ lli@@ on US dollars , which at the same time have been around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the exchange rates and property prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the tw@@ ins , which is not out of the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 years in the USA , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which could not invest in a final loop against the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would not invest in a final loop against the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would not invest in the end . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who would not invest in fear that his son would kill him if he is going to grow , &quot;
ignor@@ ing the circum@@ stance that leads to that o@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills it .
this is my ha@@ sten with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely liter@@ al art . all the in@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further improve human talents , and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and poor as a majority control the government .
the ath@@ etic democracy closed naturally too many out --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be an error , the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to these conclusions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing of the ath@@ etic democracy was and is that they have been the working poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and more important to them to have the right to political co @-@ determination in questions of state resistance . &quot;
ath@@ etic democracy has not been kept for a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which is very light shining , it is also rapidly expanded . &quot;
&quot; however , our present @-@ liberal democr@@ acies have not its roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; in the Magna of C@@ arta , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Charta which ultimately was a statute for ruling class . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible , as a whole separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process has been limited to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- has been a democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in our present democr@@ acies since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , the economy is gradually falling into politics and ma@@ stered them . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer like the former ?
it is not about a degeneration of their DNA .
it is that one cannot be in the government today and yet it is not in power because the power of politics is acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ irs with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about as a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably nour@@ ishes the animals , of which they are nourished , dec@@ eived by the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that the politics becomes so far can@@ ni@@ zed , that it grows by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valu@@ ated , the overall economic demand falls , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism sells the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins of human labor , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring about politics and the economy and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; control the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t very good .
the doctrine of the Deb@@ ac@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor will only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ ite by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , such as long economy and politics are separated , the automation of the tw@@ ins is higher , the waste of waste , and social conflicts are deeper , just as I think -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to rebuild the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and thereby making sure we end the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so , the question is not whether capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements that he has brought forth to survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a di@@ st working , similar to the society in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve the human being and the people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ ener &apos; A@@ gora , in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what could it look , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; - &quot; utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; like a similar d@@ yst@@ er ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies , please introduce a capital market before making money earned while you work and in which your capital follows you from a working place to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is property of those who &apos;re currently working in the company . &quot;
then all the income from capital and creation date and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees working there , however , no more exchange between capital and labour , and ultimately no high gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately no up@@ lift truck . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies could have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; continue to introduce the entire world trade in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; , &quot; -- and any government pays the sum which corresponds to the deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; also , imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; Green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment means . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard key@@ nes in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference held from 1944 .
the problem was that one was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a united policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe , is at the same time liber@@ ated , in which it preferred privileged people , and Marxist , because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the m@@ ül@@ lei@@ gh of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , globally key@@ n@@ esians . &quot;
&quot; but above all , there is a world where we can imagine real democracy . &quot;
will we w@@ aking up in such a world
or will we get into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we are working together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we are doing it better democratically . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography even as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do not , technological development will generate a massive drop in the economic demand that Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mer is called &quot; long st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next , as we experience it up to date , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as well as Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely wir@@ elessly . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are at ease . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you do not throw away you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers , you have very clearly told what you think of the West &apos;s perspective on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the sem@@ b@@ lance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics during the field , where most of the world plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is today similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error that identifies historically .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ ale , such as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was especially skep@@ tical as regards the democratic development .
&quot; what can now be observed in China , resembles a lot of the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now ready to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , it smells its hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
&quot; BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance , the beginning of the year . &quot;
Y@@ V : I assume that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continuous denial that ran a massive displ@@ ac@@ ement of the euro zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was , who revealed this denial . &quot;
&quot; sorry . unfortunately , the powers within the euro area , within the European group , continue to elect the denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not able to get rid of political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , one may perhaps delay a while , but when the change occurs , he happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its construction .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ous , ... &quot;
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any Minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he did not have any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ ors , finding a common solution . &quot;
but that was not there .
&quot; they only wanted to bring our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the ev@@ ils that have been delayed by the eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to conc@@ ede that for 5 years she has led a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece .
we lost one third of our nom@@ in@@ alen GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; neither of the Troika of don@@ ors , which imposed us this policy , and a : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ tic error . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of the talks , you still seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived . &quot;
&quot; for if they did not survive , the released fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic , and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy of the world .
&quot; when we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be also unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy , most of them have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading provider at Amazon Studios
the TV production firm of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ gehog and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because it is responsible for making the shows and the contents to produce the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fighting industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy can not be selected .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this corner . &quot;
this curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review score .
&quot; will your show be valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ one , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- &quot; all the shows , the addic@@ tive , where to ask a rel@@ ay , your brain asks , &quot; &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- which should tell you enough what happens at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you have already special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle explo@@ iters , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they are just enth@@ r@@ alled . &quot;
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something , therefore Roy Price will not risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online , where anyone can watch every free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon gives free things out there , one still takes up , right ? &quot;
millions of spectators have a look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team that will take everything .
&quot; you capture , when you start the show , when you pause , which parts one can jump and look again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then the show should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four re@@ publi@@ can sen@@ ators . &quot;
you did this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 amounts to 7.5 -- therefore something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . its name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but it makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use this data to find these little details about the audience , which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a Wag@@ nis and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this corner . so exactly where they wanted .
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; it has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow failed that this should work with everything .
&quot; when one collects millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then one should make a good decision . &quot;
one has 200 years to statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the minus what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; when data analysis does not work , then this is something scary because we are living in a time where we can take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does someone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software . come in touch with it in prison .
&quot; if someone is here in the United States and ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if an dism@@ iss@@ al is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; average television , 22 minutes , which can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always the best results created , this is not that a company like multi @-@ Health system does not know how to use data . &quot;
even the data are sealed @-@ in companies are even wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; 2009 , Google announced that they can predic@@ t through data analysis of flu , the worst way -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year round year to year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the revocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data rever@@ sible companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these mistakes , data flows in decisions of life -- on the workplace , in case of legal action , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather make sure that data are helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imaginable many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
&quot; or the development of a medicine . over the years , I have recognized some samples on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed . &quot;
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you are doing mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; as a second , you put this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the parts ; as a wide , you put the parts again together to hold a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : to take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something there is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to reset , even if the information is incomplete in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and mind where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , why they otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been able to put together , and make it a show like &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; which did not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that meant that she entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used to control all of their decisions , first as they chose TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; they say to us the data .
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things are wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and not to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before it dates , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; - just here at this moment . &quot;
&quot; later , I will strike it later with a Techni@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I have made some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have heard in the night on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it through a much amount of compensation , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this is not changing the basic building .
&quot; in this way , the ball will be cl@@ ums@@ y and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions , if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off , making decisions to be an expert in what you are doing and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks nice .
