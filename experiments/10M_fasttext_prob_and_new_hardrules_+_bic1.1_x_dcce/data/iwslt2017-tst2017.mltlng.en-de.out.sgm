<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone had heard from Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA listened to illegal phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation where the CIA literally handed down drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds like, you can read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapters did not fell?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government was determined against Risen and called it to call its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistle-blowers to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First constitutions, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get these information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they offer."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government raged with Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had for years indications that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the Government of Risen were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and springs can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of bringing and relay to statements, that could also handle his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so, the investigators, without his consent, his phone are secretly concerned,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just as his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even travel-references with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blowers and risons of the supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is just one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect the whistle-blowers. but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistle-blowers to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we set the press work for the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more and more possibilities to compose all out."</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, just as technology of the government permits the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can take this from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the afterward, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that has not yet been written as Risen his book and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source overhaul system for whistle-blowers, originally developed by the internet mastermind, which was developed by us Aaron Swartz, and today is today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"to send an e-mail, go to a news page, just like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective message agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot find more information secretly, and many of the information they would be requested would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spying technologies that endanger us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to ensure that not only technology denominator such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to judge misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to report about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers, and of crowded hospitals. or the next environment-workers, the alarm to contaminated water from Flint suggests. or a Wallstreet insider, warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crime, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the largest acquisition of history was released.] [we baten Robert Palmer of Global Ways around one statement.] This week we were killed by news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosbag Fonseca"</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse of the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Mosbag Fonseca go and say," okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a ally deter of the brutal Syrian dictatorator Bar-Assad's Bashar al-Assad in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed to lead a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin, through a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous upon the next release and the next uncovered documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the Plot of an agency code or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to be crying out of you, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we go what to do?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Ways, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are to be used to hide and conceal their assets -- something that we have been discussing and enthused for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people this whole world appears very confusing, and it is hard to understand how this tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a Matrjoschkapger.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there have been no prominent American Americans, which occurred in this revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which this tax havens function, Mosbag has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a backup from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections in the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is such that one needs less information in some US states to set less information to create a company than to get a librarian card."</seg>
<seg id="68">"this type of intransparent in the US has allowed employees of school-districts, school children."</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed frauds to avert especially susceptible investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that all concerns us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Ways we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a capped investigators in the offices of 13 lawyers companies in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself as a African minister, who want to bring money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"shook us really, that all of us made suggestions on a lawyer of our investigators, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all premeetings. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course anyone handed over money to us. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an attack.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has made suggestions on our intercapped investigator proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leaders, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to deter this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this might sound very much, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a secure optimist, I certainly see that things have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen before increasing transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron in the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has captured in central registers at national level, who truly is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is going back here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Ways this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who become angry when they see, how other people can hide their true identity behind headhunters."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which will get up and say:" transparency is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to stop through laws this type of inflation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finish the transparency, which now enables these kinds of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I once kidnapped almost and in the trunk of a red maze."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design study, I made a backfale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artwork.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made straight a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where sess thou today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing even worse," I don't know it yet. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleep place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says, he would go to peace-grain, but I don't know if he really is planning. I will not kidnapped in the trunk of a maze!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have a air maternity. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"said a voice in my head said," "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I starred to the ceiling and thought:" "Oh dear! what was I built there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildfire sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, totilt at the door, and shut up my bedroom."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he had bought from me, depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe people, who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air-mat, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air maternity."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate draws up and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have survived how we could make something to do. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and each morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and built so "air matratze and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mat on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham Omelet tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them all over the city. when we passed our last guest and opened the door to the castle, starring Brian and I felt forward."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented ourselves to investors:" "we would like to create a website, on which people post publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room, whose doors can be passed when you visit."</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite wild foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they are not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still very consolation, would invest in a shop, the stranger permits, in apartments of other people to sleep."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you feel on the things that one can do well. we could desnen."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just looks and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to build objects, but now we wanted to create through design immense confidence between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a rehearsal, what degree of confidence we strained."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock that you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your remote mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent flight from panic, which you now feel right now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"because the only thing, which is more personal than your mobile phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the bullock of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">The majority sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most guests feel when they are somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once so, who now actually has Al Gores cell? "</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare on Twitter that he channel for the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour would have imagined only once with his name; if he could have told whence he comes how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 assessments which all say," "he can really feel very well unlocked phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel like you would like to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-designed feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to prevent negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their reviews before we put it online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprisingly, we trust the people most who are most like us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social disparity.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting is to add to the call of an individual -- in our case by moving departments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">Thus the right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"furthermore, we learned that confidence depends on how much you can get from."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"when one tells too little, such as" "Hi!", "you do not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells us a lot, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" Tolle artworks in your apartment! I make with my family vacation. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds up hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we had not reckoned, was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First of all: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third: a need, which was not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have inallowed parties celebrated or houses devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it does hurt if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the attacks was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, from the 123 million the nights had a fraction of only a fraction ever encountered."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people are familiar to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, there can be wonderful people."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the needed surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travellers looking to heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel, who save one life even though they don't know at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"they drive one in the hospital in the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want to feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charge extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So naturally not every stay is starting.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here to make an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now simply to name" "rental industry", "the item will not do justice."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">Humans lay part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is compared to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place that one would like to wait a group there Ansässiger to wait a thoroughly rinse and to show a bar in a pub that one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking of a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from scratch on the interconnectedness?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the thoughts of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and failure.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already been started. many parking places that included the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now residents offered. students who were looking for a job</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were educated. there were incubators programs started;</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone the night 785 000 people will be host to guest at a foreign or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"hospitality, there was also previously."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of the trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find that amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright down.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it if a red Mazda is passing by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or oppressed, a brainlaundering, a terrorist attack?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay at the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media folks are the same as I do.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslims, it's great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagitation-gym-fanatics in</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual muscle."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to have decided.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as a muscle. I decided to bear the hijab my head."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," why oppressed you yourself? "</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lusek was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, and indeed to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, I thought, asked in question, doubted and believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the grain.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever have the feeling that someone you perceive, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in essence the" Egyptian American Dream "." "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had dinner at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" Eilabsening "." "</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, aircraft flew in buildings, people splashed from buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into indignation quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists "..."... "... in the name of Islam..."... "..."... "..." "Jihad..." "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu turned me the deeds of others by a citizen in a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start the creation."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we were silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as a muscle."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard that I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," be vigilant, "" Seid careful, "" Bleigh in well illuminated areas, "" Versammmed you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw this extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held for Muslims, demolished in the Free and proposed."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brands on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not really right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I replied the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love issues."</seg>
<seg id="319">"there are the accusations, which are hard."</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to suspend Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malicious tumor can be removed as a whole and a benign tumour only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the US, but an essential organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teacher and Olympias and Olympias.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it may keep some parking free, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people of other faith tolerant, and to show greater civil participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not allocalized in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radialized in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radialization process, one has noted that it starts online. as a first, the person will believe from their church, even by their family, so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who despise their behavior and ideology is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we need to stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a non-violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally a group like the IS establishes their brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a muscle, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do anything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves to their imagination, if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups are claiming their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one throws a look at it, it does not drives them what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she had imagined to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought her wrath to her mind, her sense of injustice in the world, it would only be in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"of nothing inspired and something that had given sense to her mind, it was a main goal for the instrumentalisation through extremists which you spoke a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of replacing them for their anger, he showed up constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, keep them to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was a glimpse of how the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy on our thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually indicate several neuroscientific studies -- when we fear that happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authorized government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: when a testbed has been presented, in which negative about Muslims, they vote rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood against Muslims from above - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"in fact, it can be a tool for manipulation of the public to compensate the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Handling of Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear turns to all of us."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collectives, it is not just about to explain yourself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of them went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental Faculty, talented, promising, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweet, generous man, whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his life. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is that of my breasts, such a sealed young man has become?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she killed, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, which was in the afternoon to visit. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution, after he had posted an expression against Muslim on his facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He enjoyed eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism may not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or we stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we felt it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about how America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the nursery, we went quiet, with high-pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, went out my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked himself and was welcomed to our guests, because half of the gathered Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, believers, believers and non-believers who have come to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudice prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you choosing at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those that mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="407">"what started as a platform for crafting, is just about to become a billion cap."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air package, in our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of airmachines in the Frac Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"through interconnecting air devices, high speed and speed up to narrow space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up-to-date structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to present you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system of autopom, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamical Tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a member of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room where calculations on board determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest image. for example, start" "start" "and" "land." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called Heckstarter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a device, which tries to beat two flies with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starter motors, it is efficient in the forward-forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the Starrgs it can float, and it has a great advantage when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of heckters is that they are sensitive to turbulence like wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air conditioner no matter in which position the optimum position regained and the performance by practicing can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often represent fundamental abstract issues that penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the petty-possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that gather together in order to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilot-controlled flight devices could fly, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear suspension."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monopinner that served mechanical remote remotely. it was invented in front of short fiction.</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clap, hinges and cross-rests, no further actuators or checklist surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, in the inside, it happens very much so that it can be stable and can move freely in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-peckers. to get it to the fly, I have to properly throw it correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability to throw it correctly if you watch all that is low, so I show you a video that filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in genius, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellors, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he gets the ability of the ability to be."</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is turned or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellors."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some of them can be found in models, the rest is learns directly at the fly."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely secure and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in the clockwise sense</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrucopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by driving a half.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one disc bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in the room she is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine is there that you want to become a flying lampshade at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the reward lies in the development and the creation of the creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures, to shape them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they didn't put your energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into the space-time frame itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let's arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.9 billion years ago was a majority of life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought some things: corals, fish, plants, Saul, people and -- God stand up to us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group particularly graceful -- Rai Weiss, from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - have a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise for example due to collidizing black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people knew it as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation was co-funded.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the laser-Interferometrium observatory observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-time the precision of LIGO could considerably increase the recognition performance enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore one calls him Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was started for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, pushes the gravitational-waves of the two collidizing black holes through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my todill's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All of what I had worked is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes to theoretical physicists of black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crow in the texture of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire content is stretched in a direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"in the illustration, lecturers in courses for relevance theory often lead to a correct alberish dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusty, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, everyone was stretched out of us at the rise of the waves and punched. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeroes after the comma, followed by a 1st of Wherefore the LIGO employees are crazy for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic time. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"boxes Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves in the following:" the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are educated and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott is happy, LIGO would be more than one eye than one eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial coatings, the size of your phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because so you can create an image or a map of things by watching the light coming from several points of coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">"in tones, it is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean particularly much to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen according to certain properties such as clay and height, rhythm and volume to close the history behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now speaking just Alice."</seg>

<seg id="516">"dummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can provide you with no simple pictures of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by having regard to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can hear their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least there are the measured frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert shaft patterns in Shall, we can speak the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity too loud, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, how my colleague Scott has already worked very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, pantelopes simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same pantelopes with an additional sound-change. this sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu! "</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a sort of movement of movement bearing in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LIGO: [Surrenal noise] Jemini, who knows what he has to hear, realize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun mass, which about as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the most dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each one hundred times a second, before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"LIGO has a completely new way to investigate the universe, as it was never before possible."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">"much in all, we can -- virtually or basically -- not see."</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why masserene stars in super-novae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about this.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes are to happen at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, as the urine is covered by its own descendant."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using the gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before, and of which we don't have any idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO was immediately found in the first attempt things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at the MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO-Project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that bring black holes, like LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the Universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are to say the sauce for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO gives us a completely different angle of view at all, on the creation of the stars and ultimately it on how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos."</seg>

<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid, I feared my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"to keep my fear, speeches, my social fear -- dff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes that my life changed deeply, on an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls from inexplicable reasons all"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-terrace."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"of a new way of life in my family. from there I hurry to play with them as soon as you ask me to ask for. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am happy."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an intriguing side-effect: only recently I was completely understood that the "yes" saws for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things out of you awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Create TV. I producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in great style. "</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television programme can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days four shows four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three broadens, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America I run my television series on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I myself created, and not only produced, so I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans of campfire and to tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, which burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so all of you who work so hard if you now speak a company, a country or a household, take me seriously when I say I say, I understand that I don't just want to dream about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I'm born in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is when I set up troops, as a mold I on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as for example, you have a high sound, lieder a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when working works well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could always drive for it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take, when I talk to them the buzz, that I'm talking about writing, that the writing is pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz I began when I began working with television production when I began to work and to work and to work together, I discovered this thing, that sums, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have so a buzz, then you cannot strive differently from size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling that may not be different, than to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only, that I am not for the failure, and I know only that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not ask it in question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more jobs, the more the more things simultaneously, the more things simultaneously, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more you have to work me."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land, which I create, the marathon, which I lead, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just that buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, extended, extended, extended."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single workstation."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," "kittens, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of an Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums up."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't loved my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, passed on weekends, no remored, nothing delegate, there is not on, with wholeheartedly, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me there was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what to do, if what you do is doing the work that you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," "Heule you out, stupid the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you are doing what you do is doing a teacher to be a painter, a father, a mother, and knows how to feel the buzz when you stop the buzz, if you stop the buzz, who is then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"listening to the song of my heart, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states" waitress in "a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late, and she says:" "Mama, magst du playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say NO to be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, they don't called me."</seg>
<seg id="675">"it is no longer called" "kittens." ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is it happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan am and my buzz, and here everything is changing my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, magst du playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters encounter it, we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops "." "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the Summing, I can do nothing but to match."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land, which I create, the marathon, which I lead, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they don't exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists in sticky fingers and humid caps, delicate voices, guard and the song in which it comes to slogans, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathed.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and a energy panel comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzz, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. this is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the working environment, the fixtures, this is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself using broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums of money is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">Real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the electricity that comes from living.</seg>
<seg id="711">True sums of money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums may ignore the pressure of the story, which have relied on performing tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">True sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true sums of God is the voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered me God the false words, because what God told me that I am an Titan Go?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this a fixed rule so I can free myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is a law, I have no choice. I do not have any other choice if I want to hear the buzz again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"play is not part of me, as they work."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I am always working, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I'm rather at the workplace as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, because what kind of man does rather work than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I am."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan, "</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"that I am too relaxed, is none of them."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden around, before and back, go back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crates soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">Thereby I feel mostly rigid, absent and confused. "</seg>
<seg id="736">I always walk after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe meets me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also tell it! let them always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me for naïve for a taglider.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you may well, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play a maximum of 15 minutes with me, until they are resourceful that they want something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkins or Keks replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teenager all 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more requires not."</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can bring 15 minutes to the piece even in a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the kids will do."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my wellbeing, my world. it must not be the children, to feel the buzz, to have a place for his soul."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it is about pleasure</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I shading and I am there. friends meet, reading books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" is short for everything I was given up when I got my first TV show, when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to make myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my free time. the buzz seems to return when I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens up, the energy flows up and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, she fulfills me and my soul. I pray to new ideas. I use it in full circle and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz; the buzz is not me... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my credit.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the buzz of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for it."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is a doll, that I am a Titan Poker. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and too more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">"and yet, I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire are still burning."</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clearly my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land, which I create, the marathon, the vases, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the other, the right sums, the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, beating, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this buzz, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things out of I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and too more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery in.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon is it very frustrating that the brain, as opposed to other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was working neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous system through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly they have heard of one of the most popular, the" "field-duster stimulation". "it implanted an electrode deeply in the brain to influence the schematics of neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson that suffered from fierce trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was the captain of the doctor and worked out the day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I catered patients with skull-brains trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that at skull-brain-traumas the brain inclined and the skull-like to be tilted.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one has to diminish the skull-inner."</seg>
<seg id="816">You sometimes need to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissues to grow is comparable with quite small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive it thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trials we managed to Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw among his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the BiologieLessons that stem cells unripe cells that can transform itself into every cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small nish of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising that this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells hold different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a couple of weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but kept differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecorine-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandhirnrinse cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they ensure the separation of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- by these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate cells exactly as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And then gently mark it to be able to pursue them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we implanted it to the reception of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplant -- Autotrangers.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implant these cells in normal brain tissues? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in corrupt brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we implanted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken up after a few weeks as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario we added a violation of and implanted exactly the same cells, and now the cells were preserved -- they washed away to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we were in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we are using monkeys with a manual reaction."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take forage from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when she had reached a stable skill level, we last in the motor cortex the handmotoric area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen by people, they recovered spontaneously to some degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to relax with the help of sculptural brainisms. they rest at some degrees as well as on the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recreation, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not that precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the stimulation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use them.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neurological models, for example with Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that there are several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely recommend.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get the permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take, until someone can get to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the authorisation of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it needs a long time to select patients to perform and evaluate treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multicentric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thanks for your visit to TED and that you have told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the brittle plant, which it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable tissue.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitation in Beijing have proven beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"indeed, democracy is waking up with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as Minister of Finance Ministers in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to be influenced by austerity, which have been realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my written friends, who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe in cooperation with me, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup an error, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defence democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies will be reported in one, our future dark and our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently being threatened with our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twins summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt of debt, which throws its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all know the debt crisis,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the vertices and corporations, which are too anxious to invest, where it would be productive and income, with which you need to wear the debt crisis and also take all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example 'green' energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months have been invested in the US, in England and in the euro zone, 3.4 trillion US dollars, in all the wealth produced products, such as industrial installations, machinery, office buildings, schools, tracks, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3,4 trillion US dollars sounds worth a lot of money until you interact with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time have been around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the exchange rates and property prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital form the twins, which is not out of the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54 years in the USA, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which could not invest in a final loop against the pessimism of investors, which would not invest in a final loop against the pessimism of investors, which would not invest in the end. just like Ödipus father, who would not invest in fear that his son would kill him if he is going to grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Ignoring the circumstance that leads to that oedipus kills it.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hasten with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely literal art. all the inproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further improve human talents, and especially to finance the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athetic democracy closed naturally too many out --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be an error, the significance of the athenical democracy due to these conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive thing of the athetic democracy was and is that they have been the working poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and more important to them to have the right to political co-determination in questions of state resistance."</seg>
<seg id="935">Athetic democracy has not been kept for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which is very light shining, it is also rapidly expanded."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present-liberal democracies have not its roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"in the Magna of Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athenical democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Charta which ultimately was a statute for ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible, as a whole separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process has been limited to politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations -- has been a democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "in our present democracies since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, the economy is gradually falling into politics and mastered them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer like the former?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not about a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is that one cannot be in the government today and yet it is not in power because the power of politics is accustomed to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hairs with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about as a flock of carnivores that sustainably nourishes the animals, of which they are nourished, deceived by the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that the politics becomes so far cannized, that it grows by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devaluated, the overall economic demand falls, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism sells the" demos "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twins of human labor, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring about politics and the economy and it would be better if the" demos "control the control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the Debacel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor will only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedriglohnite by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, such as long economy and politics are separated, the automation of the twins is higher, the waste of waste, and social conflicts are deeper, just as I think -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to rebuild the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and thereby making sure we end the reunified area, otherwise we end up the film" matrix "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so, the question is not whether capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements that he has brought forth to survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dist working, similar to the society in" "Star Trek", "in which machines serve the human being and the people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of ancient Athener 'Agora, in long talks the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what could it look, how could it look like this" star Trek "-" utopia instead of the "" matrix "" like a similar dyster? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies, please introduce a capital market before making money earned while you work and in which your capital follows you from a working place to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is property of those who're currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all the income from capital and creation date and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees working there, however, no more exchange between capital and labour, and ultimately no high gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately no uplift truck."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies could have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"continue to introduce the entire world trade in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos "," in units of "cosmos", "-- and any government pays the sum which corresponds to the deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"also, imagine that this fund is investing in" Green "technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment means."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard keynes in the Bretton Woods Conference held from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially against the background of a united policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe, is at the same time liberated, in which it preferred privileged people, and Marxist, because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the mülleigh of history, and keynesian, globally keynesians."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, there is a world where we can imagine real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we waking up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we get into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we are working together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we are doing it better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography even as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy... do we do not, technological development will generate a massive drop in the economic demand that Larry Summer is called" long stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next, as we experience it up to date, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as well as Hayek, this is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am completely wirelessly."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are at ease."</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you do not throw away you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers, you have very clearly told what you think of the West's perspective on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics during the field, where most of the world plays, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I may say that provocative, China is today similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error that identifies historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberale, such as John Stuart Mill -- "</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical as regards the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can now be observed in China, resembles a lot of the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now ready to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, it smells its hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">"BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance, the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I assume that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say goodbye to the complacency, and the continuous denial that ran a massive displacement of the euro zone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was, who revealed this denial."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"sorry. unfortunately, the powers within the euro area, within the European group, continue to elect the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not able to get rid of political will and authoritarianism in life, one may perhaps delay a while, but when the change occurs, he happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">"BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- Serious,..."</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any Minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he did not have any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"I believed that there was an honest interest in the donors, finding a common solution."</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not there.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they only wanted to bring our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the evils that have been delayed by the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that for 5 years she has led a catastrophic program in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominalen GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"neither of the Troika of donors, which imposed us this policy, and a:" that was a colostic error. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive Tons of the talks, you still seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>

<seg id="1030">"" "my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived."</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they did not survive, the released fliers will be demonic, and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be catastrophic consequences for Europe, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"when we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post-modern 1930, what it appears to me, it will be also unbearable for the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you will be wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you so much that you were with TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"by Roy, most of them have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading provider at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production firm of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because it is responsible for making the shows and the contents to produce the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fighting industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can not be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review score.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will your show be valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad "," "Game of Throne," "The Wire", "" The Wire "--" all the shows, the addictive, where to ask a relay, your brain asks, "" where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, are shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- which should tell you enough what happens at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you have already special intelligence to offer" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the middle exploiters, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they are just enthralled."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something, therefore Roy Price will not risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online, where anyone can watch every free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon gives free things out there, one still takes up, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators have a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team that will take everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture, when you start the show, when you pause, which parts one can jump and look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then the show should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four republican senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">You did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,4 amounts to 7.5 -- therefore something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but it makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use this data to find these little details about the audience, which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a Wagnis and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," "House of Cards" "Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 review on this corner. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"it has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow failed that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when one collects millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then one should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years to statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the minus what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"when data analysis does not work, then this is something scary because we are living in a time where we can take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software. come in touch with it in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is here in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if an dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"average television, 22 minutes, which can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always the best results created, this is not that a company like multi-Health system does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data are sealed-in companies are even wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009, Google announced that they can predict through data analysis of flu, the worst way -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year round year to year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data reversible companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these mistakes, data flows in decisions of life -- on the workplace, in case of legal action, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather make sure that data are helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">"or the development of a medicine. over the years, I have recognized some samples on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed."</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you are doing mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a second, you put this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the parts; as a wide, you put the parts again together to hold a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: to take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something there is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to reset, even if the information is incomplete in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and mind where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, why they otherwise wouldn't have been able to put together, and make it a show like" "House of Cards", "which did not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that meant that she entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used to control all of their decisions, first as they chose TV ideas, then when they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they could always say: "they say to us the data.</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things are wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and not to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before it dates, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball "." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely," - just here at this moment. "</seg>
<seg id="1131">"later, I will strike it later with a Technique."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have made some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have heard in the night on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it through a much amount of compensation, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this is not changing the basic building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in this way, the ball will be clumsy and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions, if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off, making decisions to be an expert in what you are doing and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
