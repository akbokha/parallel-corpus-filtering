Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt where young people will meet young people today .
a se@@ pul@@ ous chapel , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is buried . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the most profound cause of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it doesn &apos;t matter if land cards are not up to date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had to exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead took place in a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical map of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , is anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but is very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online @-@ cards .
&quot; then , how many cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Mer@@ cury has changed since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a spl@@ attered canvas that one cannot recognise as such .
&quot; in the large picture postcard we were involved in cities and churches with detailed maps , so @-@ called vo@@ posi@@ tional sheets . &quot;
these emerged according to the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ Mess@@ inian administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and kidn@@ apped the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader were occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War .
Napoleon wants an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ o@@ graphic recording of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if French troops served with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from 9th February 18@@ 01 , it was the present neighbours that created the idea of an area of Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ o@@ graphic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ meas@@ urer . &quot;
the judgment sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ Library .
the comparison of fruits / Today is most impressive at the example of the provincial capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears in the map of 18@@ 56 yet relatively isolated .
&quot; Send@@ ling was built 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as a district of Munich . &quot;
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses under@@ took care of 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : at the first glance : in writing a small dis@@ advant@@ aged card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written characters from the so called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; , &quot; derived from which the basic tax is derived . &quot;
small plots do not occupy farmers today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area stands out north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Carnival of the October Revolution , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the jungle sheet , one reads in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only reads the road names &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the liar , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ Field Street one once used people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; there , 18@@ 58 / 59 was the Mün@@ chner district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ eventh . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden the institution - that Psy@@ chiat@@ rist , who is brought to the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; he was most advanced for his time , and for example , the Ank@@ ets of so called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; moreover , he is forbidden to use the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had been first place , later it was expanded to 500 seats . &quot;
at some point these capacity did not look any more - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of the biggest psychiat@@ rists in Germany . &quot;
the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt is now meeting young people in Mün@@ chner Sal@@ esians .
&quot; the Order received the building complex 1920 , and walked in a youth home with educational establishments . &quot;
&quot; west lies the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children of &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; set up the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in architectural reference to the country of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was founded around 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ er@@ strasse was named &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought in the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
one big until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a tomb chapel dating from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days took the curtains and take place on 5 April 2017 of the sp@@ ade line for the second S @-@ Bahn platform . &quot;
with the sli@@ der the old Munich map can be compared with the a@@ erial view of today - and the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil rights group published trip for Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the Promotion of Contemporary Art has issued a warning for coloured people which are on the basis of discri@@ min@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Mis@@ souri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Mis@@ souri , which is intended to come into force by 28 August 2017 , by bringing special attention to the state through the state , because a number of frag@@ mentary , hard @-@ based incident occur in recent times throughout the state and be listed here , &quot; &quot; it says in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes it harder to win discrimination against minorities , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportion@@ ately to minorities , prompted the group to recover the voy@@ age , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , the people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are assembled or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited as rac@@ ist ple@@ tion against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under fragile circumstances beginning of the year , after he had no more pet@@ rol during the trip and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ souri , without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Direc@@ torate @-@ owned by Mis@@ souri , in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state is 75 percent more common than White . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready whether there are chew@@ ing money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
Mis@@ souri presented 100 hate @-@ hate in 2015 according to the latest figures from the hate @-@ breaking reporting program of the F@@ BI that character@@ ize the state regarding the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country .
&quot; the journey is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law , which would make it more difficult to shor@@ ten a company because of living or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ation Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel orders for Texas and Arizona , after the United Nations Cre@@ denti@@ als adopted , the local prosecution authorities to commit people to emig@@ ration according to the opinion of AC@@ L@@ U for further re@@ pro@@ filing . &quot;
&quot; travel orders are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have employed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
consec@@ rated project is elementary
the fisher@@ y Wei@@ de@@ ench@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have got a picture on site .
&quot; at the rectangle of the family Schwen@@ dem@@ ann , representatives of the fisher@@ y CD@@ U @-@ local Association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann offers first insights into its operation , in which it combines 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk and also houses many young animals and houses in five apartments holiday guests . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; black milk &quot; &quot; is for him the ageing mark@@ eter for the milk of its cows , so pi@@ er@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests only comes region@@ ally .
&quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of fisheries bach , he called the &quot; &quot; elementary project &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can not succeed in such steep surfaces .
the green area care for a lot of work ; much need to be edited with the engine sense .
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ al operation and past@@ ed these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers , even if he does not perform bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the significance of the course of women and is glad to support the Leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per h@@ ect@@ are , farmers must be supported . &quot;
&quot; one hope that the surface of the surface could still be moved out for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the biggest treasure that we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thinking about how they continue to work their business , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism due to the promotion often
&quot; in 2013 , 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the open space is about 40 hectares , which are not allowed until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of it was supported by Leader , a district carried by the Municipality of fisher@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers have had 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac said , &quot; You are doing a really good job , without farmers and land wives . &quot;
also for Peter White was fixed : &quot; here best food products are produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape of S@@ HR @-@ Württemberg ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state promotion of ordination of ordination .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ named conveyors .
&quot; in addition , the in@@ conclu@@ sive area may not be tow@@ ed ( h@@ att@@ acking over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ forest@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; for the fishing course of the fishing project 2018 it is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which are building under 16 kilometers of fence . &quot;
&quot; the open space corresponds to 35 hectares , the cold costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty .
the safest sign of a regime transfer is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the pain@@ fully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did , when he did a symbolic dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the President for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller handle not the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of jet@@ owners and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators had taken him out if he had done it .
&quot; but he laid their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base has been added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem which you refer to which later was added and not part of the original statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is correct properly , but as he form@@ ulate it , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the upright words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; yours fatigue , your arms , / your oppres@@ sive masses that longing for , free to breath , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; miserable drop &quot; on our screens better to see .
Miller is not committed to liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America .
&quot; Lazarus and her friends , who put themselves in place their words on the basis of their death on the base - knew very well that they are a high political act . &quot;
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American public@@ anism by presenting the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has got a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the link with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Lazarus the significance of the statue changed , the people from the right wing wanted to change it long . &quot;
&quot; the big letter when Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed that the Statue of Liberty does not load , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , which is the American flame re@@ filled into the world : &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty goes . &quot;
it is intended to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
pretty unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the importance of the statue is quite and at all a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted in them to see how they were seen by the exhaustive , but hopefully people after long and often terrible trips to the decks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp do ever want to recognise . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black hole members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle reminds itself of a time when only two ball@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain .
&quot; the leader of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the World Championship , will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday . &quot;
black believes that &quot; in Scotland has developed something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue to proceed until we find it , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals of medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the team for the team members . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is rather modest .
&quot; their captain speech was amazing , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and genuine feeling , the E@@ ili@@ ie completely naturally came , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth Silver medal , which is present at their fifth world Championships at the 400 @-@ m @-@ hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 k@@ ills are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes on the world championship was seven that were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the cent@@ er@@ un@@ ners Mu@@ ir leads on this road and took up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m is another sn@@ otte , which one was observed after a great season , who was able to watch the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle reminds itself of her first world Championships as the only other gravel in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the team captain &apos;s captain tells that they are &quot; enormously proud of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team but in some cases also in medals and in the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special about being to be a team captain in it is that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but knowing that my team @-@ mate has voted for me and have chosen me to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all those who belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; and they are established here as established athletes , athletes , who want to rise to Po@@ dium . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
&quot; I just noted that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship . &quot;
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadi@@ on .
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : do not block any public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the income of voters
the Father of our country knew something of poor press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long before the newspapers smote him because of everything , from internal policies to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sli@@ pped in criticism , safe . &quot;
but he did not have his critics at silence .
&quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we shall be s@@ laugh@@ ing like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Govern@@ ors Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work on it to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ ck employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil War said it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the stick of the Gover@@ nor leaves the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like man@@ gan@@ ese .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the two highest approval of the 50 Gover@@ nor of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary Hit@@ z@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary tool to connect with its constitu@@ ents and to debate his ha@@ un@@ less head after chemotherapy on his site .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons who come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - that is a public forum that is considered officially and managed by staff who are to be paid with public taxes - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post defending Ho@@ ck Spre@@ ader in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ l@@ les or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ull people , which fluctu@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders , a teacher , a entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments are respectful , thoughtful , and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appeal to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyers at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ani Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ull filled , but she asked for hate @-@ hate . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary section of the sending &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then they are regarded by some more rather than a so @-@ called collective action and not as a large group of affected people . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors presented as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking an critics or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner when in former times when you have done the same that staff have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines and to burn prot@@ esters , and to make silence . &quot;
but that is exactly what happened just digital .
&quot; Ho@@ gan is not the first public officers , which is critici@@ zed for it , that he has a Facebook and other social media . &quot;
President Tru@@ mp is filed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the president of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County is the first A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she has a voters from its Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky governor Matt Be@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mailbox on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people , the pseudon@@ yms like &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; mis@@ ections , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have them sweat .
freedom of expression and disc@@ our@@ ses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; former European Union No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hope to hope for the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an will organize the 25th issue of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led last year at the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the end of the end , before he lost his new location and acts as a tournament message on behalf of the club &apos;s green@@ houses and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his glory with this event , &quot; said G@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he was stuck this place .
he is a wis@@ er Ver@@ ity of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly well , &quot; said the player native to South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as it was in the year , after I gained it , taken out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year to win . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came back to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad how it went through .
&quot; with the trio at the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and senior major champi@@ ons Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ us@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance belong to the six guns on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Drum@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking lot is £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive tobacco smoke
in the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive scre@@ w@@ ess lung cancer .
to this result scientists are coming to the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in one study .
&quot; according to our estimates per year , 167 of the lung cancer is attributable to passive smoke , &quot; said study secretary Hei@@ ko Be@@ cher . &quot;
as a comparison he moved from 1994 to this topic from 1994 .
at that time there have been more than 400 lung cancer cases due to pas@@ sports inci@@ dents per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; &quot; admitt@@ edly in the time , &quot; thus the head of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , since the underground has been much disp@@ osed , which does not notice in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which always hin@@ dered the construction works , represents a big problem for the ste@@ rup@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the mot@@ orists in front of red lights and bul@@ locks is already enormous , &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;

poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , they use no stove . &quot;
it even uses rarely a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai District in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet@@ ener - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - right in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the cor@@ ded bu@@ ggy is taken and sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the arm@@ chair - she has no furniture - where they can also perform their daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lan@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned to the fields . &quot;
Poly@@ gam@@ y is here common .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ ers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody ch@@ ased it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village ro@@ cked , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was founded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia as only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders by a public h@@ ander@@ ing in front of the occup@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red for the independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal notice . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea in the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a mor@@ ale 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with around 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , which are surrounded by b@@ ambo@@ o , and out of cor@@ ru@@ gated boxes , which have been converted by r@@ ust in several yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
only very few Indon@@ esians have made their journey here because journalists and practically no foreigners .
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , hon@@ or@@ able Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ GA Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their animated , handmade Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is an Indonesian province where 28 % of the people live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mor@@ tal and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esi@@ ed Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has built a value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua dispos@@ es of wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , this wealth are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua that ensure that Indon@@ esians has retained a powerful presence . &quot;
&quot; an examination of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military operations and units from 1998 and 2004 paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy also thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and become mer@@ c@@ il@@ ful .
&quot; according to the activists , more than 500@@ ,000 papers were killed and thousands have been crus@@ hed by the Indonesian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ uas stem from the 1970 @-@ Human Rights Commission in the 1970 @-@ Human Rights Commission to Com@@ mit Gen@@ o@@ cide .
in the region alone the Indonesian police last year more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters .
&quot; we &apos;ll lose all of it , in a report by Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from the year 2016 , in the reports of atro@@ cities in the previous year , such as un@@ lawful Hin@@ ts and torture - rape and electrodes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal rainf@@ all demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws are reinforced because of Pap@@ uas have an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes since Muslim economic recovery is changing from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
Jav@@ anese War@@ ran@@ ds sell mar@@ inated chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ers . &quot;
local people are struggling to participate here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local , who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the Women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - its market costs .
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as a Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke to inequalities and infrin@@ gements in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign . &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ i inauguration in October a deep @-@ point . &quot;
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the sho@@ cked children said to them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took impetus at their sound , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk that drunk , and smote the group with their tissues , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers threw into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard be@@ aten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set in fire and escal@@ ate things the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football ground in front of the local police station and the Military Commander center to request justice . &quot;
they bore cerem@@ onial hunting and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - in the circle constantly and a bir@@ d@@ ang mim@@ ic - from Pap@@ uas Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some prot@@ esters began stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; &quot; if the masses do more than two three resistance , shoot them dead , &quot; it is said to be released in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I was suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes w@@ rists , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not yet who has folded , but says that the ball came from the rows of the soldiers gathered together . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting was . &quot;
&quot; I ran@@ ged to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esians only one name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have k@@ issed him .
&quot; the cheese @-@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters that his officers wanted their station to &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we have to defend ourselves when men dro@@ ve to kill us , &quot; said the speaker of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators have been killed and many more in@@ jured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filmed &apos; after Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks of Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ or , the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case will be resolved promptly , so that in the future it will no longer happen &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he may agree on an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical violations of human rights violations . &quot;
but the proportions began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that have to go through &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat , when he said on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said , he has no plans in Pap@@ ua to set up a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , which charged the UNO for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua had already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ed un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I have frigh@@ tened fear . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was be@@ aten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; says he . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between village residents and the manager of a dioc@@ ese who refused to bring a unconscious man into hospital died a person and 17 others have been in@@ jured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 year @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ w@@ ned when he was in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
rising vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the site office of the company .
&quot; the police said , that the vill@@ agers were on officers , that re@@ acted by picking war@@ nings . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ il@@ it@@ ary police ) have started out on the amount of ar@@ chery and a sol@@ der .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness , as the latter were quickly supplied here , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw the participating officers and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been a tur@@ mo@@ il for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of sensual development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the stem Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green Highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by pushing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai , were arrested and arbitrary in custody , under the pretext of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some are never diving again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as range .
&quot; the people here build everything they eat , especially not@@ e@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot;
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of conf@@ ection@@ ery .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic inequalities between local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants are grown , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ous immigrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to guide their own business .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on international media stays tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported by lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they gave them the rare permission to the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesian , non @-@ eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ uas .
&quot; in March six past@@ el @-@ fish states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ones Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shal@@ e . &quot;
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ person of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry was dism@@ issed the accus@@ ations of the Group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to conce@@ al the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
people on site want to take note of more foreign governments .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , visited under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 visited , natives their Schwei@@ gen and than@@ ked him , &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; according to a source , which also attended the session , but remain anonymous . &quot;
Indonesia has a further presidential election but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably will not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Executive Board . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a Jewish military , is in im@@ pover@@ ishment and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i , as a &quot; fault , &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ar carried out a recent symbolic act of Trot@@ sk@@ im : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain right opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never come up justice , but at least they have not forgotten their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with sc@@ aled head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest thouses of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is located in just two years by the sky@@ scr@@ aper that is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept well , and we are up with the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; &quot; told a residents who took his name as George attack , Re@@ uters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais civilian protection authorities said that the units of fire fight against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 clock GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building dro@@ w@@ ned . &quot;
the government said it work on providing accommodation for those affected .
&quot; the incident can be used issues for the safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its Brand in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages from the cl@@ adding , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell @-@ tower in June have contributed to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ding in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with its large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , it was supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single is only supported on two winnings , bon@@ y did not support from the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; the often very long , but also very valued five @-@ sentence classics will remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for the reform , the objective of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only slightly lacking . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members will not have accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the competitors .
&quot; not only for the vote had come before the proposal before the proposal , the finale was reached on a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are just compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists will be in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup future in the first round the host @-@ right in the first round .
&quot; to reduce the costs of the organis@@ ers , the requirements in terms of training courses , etc . , and the players will have to complete no official media deadlines before the Davis Cup . &quot;
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring out objects into the airplane , finds a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey of passengers found that more than 20 percent are conscious or un@@ consciously sold items to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which mar@@ es the aircraft , while they were acci@@ dentally delayed kni@@ ves , or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they could have been delayed that they might be irrit@@ able with fire@@ arms , am@@ muni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people - who was carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger travellers tend to abuse the rules . &quot;
&quot; in@@ quired of the respon@@ dents that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects that are inten@@ tionally to do by T@@ SA agents , were foods and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent have passed to , know@@ ingly objects with blades carried through the safety control , whereas 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3,@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they could have brought un@@ seen drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , there are travellers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gling were brought by the airport safety , and how many it was inten@@ tionally done . &quot;
there is no surprise that the people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ are - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - through security wear those who were most often fly .
&quot; however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often uncertain how liquids can take them or how much of it .
so there is no surprise that the largest amount of the T@@ SA is conf@@ isc@@ ated by the T@@ SA .
&quot; a time long thought people , the T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; in addition , with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has now signed that a part of the customer has withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures on revenue growth and even gigantic sales goals , Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has presented a different , less gl@@ it@@ ary number : the cancellations made with the new mass market @-@ model 3 . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k had often applied to the new car over the past few months , which was advertis@@ ed for the new car , whose delivery starts . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k is a : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders are 6@@ 3,000 already withdrawn . &quot;
critics had always been advised again that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently blasph@@ em@@ y 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , spatial Mus@@ k at a telephone conference with an@@ alysts . &quot;
&quot; however , that the cancellation of so far around twelve percent of all orders become a problem , the Tes@@ la chef does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
in the last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered .
&quot; 2018 it should be taken - all models have taken together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , at present times per day 1800 reservations are made . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; should be expected in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his n@@ ag@@ el@@ ly , never in practice tested with maximum inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but it comes to larger delays , then the in@@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot accept non @-@ satisfied customers in the case . &quot;
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to reduce emissions due to the execution of the rules of Obama Era to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after having been lam@@ ented by 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency , his former decision , to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g poll@@ ut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to deal with the needs of the state environmental authorities towards re@@ action faster than previous jobs . &quot;
he did not mentioned the law@@ suit filed against his previous place in a Federal State court .
it is a deadline that ran on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for bott@@ om@@ nia o@@ zone .
&quot; announced in June , that he will be happy to delay a year in order to give their authority more time to study the plan and to avoid them in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , has long been a reliable opponent of severe environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ itt repeated repeatedly to block the regulations , or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the latest legal return for the P@@ ru@@ ff@@ an Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Minister of Ministers in Washington has decided that the EPA administration has passed its authority , when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reducing meth@@ ane lec@@ strikes . &quot;
&quot; in one of the German @-@ evening opinion , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his turn@@ around at o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely execution of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under former administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not met the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be charged by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set up the date for the execution , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who denied the EPA more than a dozen time in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court procedures , and we take time limit seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority , which there are us seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless the opinion of EPA said that P@@ rel@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; authority &quot; &quot; delay and all the others at its disposal , to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; on a solid policy and the best available information is based . &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a far @-@ reaching re @-@ release of the zone .
&quot; one last month &apos;s approved legislation is to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet provided in the Senate .
&quot; the New York &apos;s General @-@ General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States that had lam@@ ented the EPA in this week , said the group intend to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;

tum@@ ours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain Church , the old cemetery @-@ A@@ real in tum@@ ours will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 am . &quot;
&quot; whether the idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth charity seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ my .
Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique village farm . &quot;
&quot; in the year 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württemberg &apos;s Ur@@ gent Book , Count Hermann von Sul@@ z , and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster E@@ ber@@ hard from Hor@@ b , and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark . &quot;
&quot; according to the certificate of the certificate , according to the Church of the Ur@@ linger mountain apart from the sc@@ ru@@ sty parish church , too , to which the church or the cartridge law belonged to and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as seen from the description of Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the picture of tum@@ ours , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glorious sett@@ ler of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around 1600 sub@@ l@@ ements these historical circumstances .
the qu@@ ron@@ ym was born from the early medieval peculi@@ ar @-@ law .
&quot; a Lord who built a church , was rest@@ or@@ ated and occupied with a pastor , continues to ap@@ ort the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this originality . &quot;
&quot; associated with it , the right to use a pastor or to propose a new parish priest . &quot;
three alt@@ ars gave it in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Greater of the two sm@@ elled on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rack for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the windows of windows have been switched and the bell @-@ parts were stolen .
the roof was un@@ tight .
17@@ 96 French troops near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church dro@@ ple@@ aded in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the deaths from hear@@ ers . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche has been abandoned .
only the cherry @-@ storm would be possible .
in the New Year of 18@@ 34 a storm dra@@ fted a storm the cherry and half st@@ ashed .
&quot; in order to avoid an un@@ happiness , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only today still existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .

association wants to test permission of wind bikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ eds &quot; &quot; does not see legal preconditions for the construction and therefore has turned to the council . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ eds &quot; launched by Andreas Co@@ ils ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ n@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to swal@@ lows a wind power supply zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time , the concentration zone results in the exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city . &quot;
the lei is to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to have a second wind power station in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the District Government of Düsseldorf did not approved , because of its form@@ mis@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal condition , the shared per@@ missions is still un@@ lawful and therefore also reg@@ ained , &quot; said Christoph Erk@@ ens , President of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council has once again decided the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval of the District Government is still under construction .
&quot; in this point , the issuing of a permit for construction of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been given last week at the circle quad@@ rup@@ ed , explained a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes them on the occasion to review the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the running proceedings at the Board of the Board , the circle on Thursday did not want to become cont@@ ent@@ lessly with the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four to 200 meters high wind@@ wheels . &quot;
&quot; already in the past year , the company had involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen is involved , P@@ acht@@ agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of big terrain . &quot;
&quot; with construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of approximately 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity needs of all four thousand households . &quot;
the NEW re plans to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer there have been four @-@ state urban green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the circle Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ acks together : woman dies with horrible accident

the provincial road remained locked over hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year young woman made from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with their car as part of the accompanying driver with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as the accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot;
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September .
&quot; the commercial and the municipal authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September , to attract the inhabitants of the shopping stroll into the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the tra@@ ren@@ dition , Christian König , announced the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; weekend to raise awareness of what offers the own city away from the usual supermarket . &quot;
&quot; according to the market , a market with regional suppliers , similarly to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite you to &quot; Mit@@ ter@@ night shopping . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only on residents of the city and the closer region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on radio , an internet video and printed bag that refer to the Ak@@ tions weekend , such as Christian König . &quot;
city administration and commercial ren@@ ditions cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; thus , the tra@@ ren@@ ditions enter and the city to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive City . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest together with sell @-@ out Sunday , talks with all business operators and hosts in order to participate in active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the closing on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential are to be re@@ connected again or again . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
&quot; but also many natives would have lost the inner city , from the sight . &quot;
&quot; in the end , everyone would need to contribute to the city center - to rent , to rent , the businesses of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it worked with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy to overcome , which made up partly himself , had said to be king in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ g@@ it Stre@@ ich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with that at the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping opportunities &quot; &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities are taking part . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Biel@@ sal@@ za , this is the Weimar , S@@ ö@@ phor@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ lei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ sti@@ le &quot; &quot; to promote appreciation of local trade and challenge its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot;
the action at the au@@ spices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners make it clear that every citizen would be able to influence its direct environment itself .

Tru@@ mp continued by call @-@ to @-@ fle@@ ated tran@@ scription by phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the Grenz@@ m@@ auer
&quot; tran@@ scription between U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp was called on a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President accused him , because he had warned the wall to the public . said , he said to him , &quot; This may not tell you the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall in the southern border of the USA , and s@@ lay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first attack with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m trainers were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp commented that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia &apos; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on trade that was given by the government Obama would look like a &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most pleasing call for the whole day . &quot;
Mozart &apos;s Ford @-@ mass@@ acre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for Justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rested on the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge , a group of white men joined with tissues to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the M@@ b - a man middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ing strike - took a long train at his cigarette and looked after the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; bro@@ o@@ ds the man .
&quot; ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; Schre@@ ie cr@@ ates the silence , as a young black man from the passenger seat was distor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , only a post@@ p@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop is thrown around the neck &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all in the audience is very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , Civil Rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge returned to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ ray Dor@@ sey and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody was ever charged because of the kill@@ ings .
&quot; it really is in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested , although we see it in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , which helps in organizing the post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year former former congress of the State of Georgia and a life long civil society .
&quot; for him , the post@@ operative call for him serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that no injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution ; we want to end , we want healing , we want healing , but first we must receive fairness , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to heal and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a place of jurisdiction on the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI @-@ acts , received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding fauna were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none have ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on the open foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the first time in Georgia , for the first time , on the pre @-@ struggle in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ t Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said , the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby they carried away , not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins to Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they removed from prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , mo@@ cked by Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de , then closes a F@@ BI Report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a complete agreement between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence , and the identity of witnesses has dec@@ eived . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it still magnific@@ ant .
&quot; it was a constitu@@ ent mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade ago C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual post@@ p@@ its of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is vivid , erg@@ ent , and is based in a kind of profound racism , of which many believe he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to look , and yet more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ chen , because we will be confronted with its ability in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Schwar@@ ze - in a room and lu@@ te , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ der &apos;s role for years , but he said , the role I will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to preserve this story on life , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett are playing their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the nests cri@@ es and ad@@ ored him , fur@@ ious , that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , disappeared from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ des the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ der .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ti@@ ck@@ ering . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people have said then &apos; n --- &apos; .
&quot; however , &quot; &quot; funny one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and this is exactly where the energy in the room , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship , replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four sol@@ dered people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , cloth@@ ed with a dream dress , stands above the corp@@ ses of the actors and performs cheap holidays gri@@ eving Lob@@ oud &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come only down the road . &quot;
&quot; they all experienced almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Broo@@ ks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de shop , the air feels like . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and to insp@@ ect the corp@@ se . &quot;
&quot; kids ho@@ cken in their heads , record the counterf@@ eit blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , mur@@ ky a little boy , when he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes the Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch and wi@@ pe her tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the move , who has played the C@@ lan@@ der . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ ded two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks into their arms the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ing one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience fell together with the actors for dinner .
&quot; chat on a table , a white pair from Atlanta stimulated over the post@@ p@@ its with a black couple that they just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought hard to find words which feel the performance left .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like yourself and do that , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does it with me , let me believe that Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today the only police shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone holds Broo@@ ks yard on his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he began to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the post@@ ure is in a certain way inspir@@ ational , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have to end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so when we learn nothing about it , then it can happen again . &quot;
whoever does not study its own history of who knows his own history is to be condemned to repeat them .
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &apos; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard W@@ agn@@ ers , the director Frank Cast@@ or@@ f puts the director Frank Cast@@ or@@ f on a color@@ fully @-@ fri@@ vo@@ le st@@ aging in front of gigantic , six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the rotation stage ( designed by Ale@@ k@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) represents either a ashamed street corner with a mas@@ on and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; place and most advanced &quot; -@@ logo from the GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that he par@@ ked an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer , in which the Rhein@@ k@@ iller pos@@ ing as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; rocks of oil are remin@@ ding of Cast@@ or@@ fs Gui@@ del@@ v - money , power and greed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ k@@ iller - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she dec@@ ayed Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , ren in Hollywood Man@@ ier a corp@@ se in the trunk and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the glorious Ha@@ gen which surrounds the au@@ ra of a sword @-@ box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he did Sieg@@ fried .
later you have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with strong applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who is modest and de@@ pl@@ ated the hands of the Merkel @-@ smoking . &quot;
large applause there is for the festive orchestra which shows for the first time on stage - in light of the large heat back in le@@ ased leisure clothing .
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ or@@ f was anticipated by Frank Cast@@ or@@ f and his Regi@@ ete@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a beautiful whi@@ ch@@ concert over himself in 2013 , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; ruin . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Kath@@ arina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , it had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ or@@ f but also grew up an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive Res@@ um@@ é .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ys in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have worked on the school already in an open full day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum , which I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late volunteer &apos;s volunteer . &quot;
how does it come ?
quantity : I made det@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , we say , successfully dis@@ continued . &quot;
I realized that it is for me that it is wrong and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked what do you do .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight that you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps also , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
crowd : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social work training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not something unusual during the volunteer service to have several different environments ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it probably always comes to where you can be FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from aging to youth work - in all kinds of different fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in after@@ no@@ ons care . &quot;
for me it was exactly the right thing that has mat@@ ured me .
I could recognize and see my own strengths and see how it really runs .
differently than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; quantity : well , here it is not about to reck@@ on st@@ ati@@ tudes . &quot;
one always has other people in the head to have a completely different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee is , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been fet@@ ched from the family - you must always enter individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have a touch @-@ out ?
&quot; amount : for this , I am not the type . &quot;
there is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; great love , great kindness . &quot;

EPA returns to the delay of the Smo@@ g rule according to law@@ suits .
&quot; the US @-@ American Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a regulation of the Government of Obama , after which the states are obliged to di@@ gest the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 countries were forced to get the agency because of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to advance the decision that said &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Poli@@ cies 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA Chef Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June the intention of EPA had announced the EPA of EPA , which should be measured in a part of the country poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions , to define where inc@@ isions have to be made to delay more stringent air quality standards - to delay one year to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , traveled on Tuesday law@@ suit and said that the effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to withdraw a wide range of environmental conditions that the former President Barack Obama has risen , as part of a wider agenda , which should boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the efforts have triggered the return of Democrats and reserves , to worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; the lung function &quot; &quot; and can increase the symptoms of the symptoms , &quot; &quot; as as@@ thma . &quot;
community wants common area
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counterparts decides the council of flu@@ orn winds up the establishment of a common area in the future senior residence . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing piece of land was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last until the Church of the Church belonging to the Church is not covered , but there is no plans for the project so far from a private investor to st@@ em@@ y project . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common area . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered a meeting . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would have a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 m ² of space available for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the community float above , such a shared space is not considered to be the meeting place only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ derly residential building , but openly into the community . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word made from &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; round . &quot;
the decision by providing funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities .
construction is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a collaborative area would be , so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolution sees to sign@@ aled the investor that one wants to throw him in this respect no bill@@ ets between the legs , the detection - which is reduced to the ambient environment - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which is possible to reduce the trend @-@ height and the construction of economic power . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so not only Wil@@ fred Soh@@ mer , be this promise . &quot;
if it helps : unanim@@ ously passes the body .
it is not as easy as common in the common area .
&quot; Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings , with whom you are not going to be right now , therefore , one sees itself now in the common area of the window , she says : &quot; I do so hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the common area - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it looks behind it a covered sub @-@ invention at any anyway inter@@ rup@@ tly or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface one does not give a grant , but get a real , in the case of doubt , the counter@@ speech is . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , to be applied to the proposed resolution , takes place three advocates . &quot;
&quot; it remains in two counterparts at the original program that summari@@ zes Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; when we put the decision , we make a huge step by then a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

that was last not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old does not believe in performance in the first official game of the season .

hiking in the resin of Star to Stern
&quot; in the Har@@ z , the German &quot; &quot; Star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planning the society observ@@ atory for Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary way is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; come opposite to the needs of many har@@ z@@ ers , was called it . &quot;
&quot; he connect nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up along the planned route and inform about stars and constellation .
&quot; in the first phase up to 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be supplemented by the internet .
&quot; therefore , the site is a good mobile network reception . &quot;
also accessibility is a criterion .
later the star @-@ path train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ trail , the viewer experience much knowledge value , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star would have more lumin@@ aire than another , although he is much further away . &quot;
be convey@@ ed in which constellation a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating in the town centre of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 .
the location in the heart of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently they are from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with a sheer eye clearly visible .
&quot; from 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen , there have been something similar to the planned star@@ wer@@ g - the planetary path since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; beginning pre @-@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ ze ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the bar@@ ns with the individual planet - including the Little Plu@@ to on the final point - are placed precisely in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.@@ 5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun is about 70 meters away from the sun . &quot;
the entire distance of the planetary we@@ aves is about 4 kilometers .
&quot; while the light is needed from the sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedest@@ rians are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fi@@ x@@ star would still take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia who should be in a collision event in order to make the most exciting pit fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ trained World Bo@@ xing Council inv@@ aders to greet Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ spring Champion champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through an un@@ ison@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ conductor World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighters members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und .
&quot; Gar@@ cia , stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How does it go to you ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple for photos pos@@ ered , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have risen for bronze &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to go down to lightweight .
and he must move towards lightweight weigh@@ ers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko voted on .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ by @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko has to be a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell according to their light @-@ weight title in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ by @-@ view mode , because all the fans were asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and oppressed himself later to fight in the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the triple champion from River@@ side , look very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... You always wanted the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show strength , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said , they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle . &quot;
&quot; this is the fight , which has to be performed . &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters and that is Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four ver@@ last after tire plat@@ ter
at an accident on the A7 the Thursday afternoon four people were seriously in@@ jured .
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost just before the junction market , probably after a tyre plat@@ ter and control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car dra@@ gged down right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he struck himself and then lying on the roof of the past@@ ures . &quot;
the four adults - two adults and two children - were heavily in@@ jured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the wounded service by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 was locked in the direction of the north for about one hour , then the traffic could be led to the left strip at the accident . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Tri@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann , after the 2 : 2 to the season pr@@ el@@ ude to Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; the first season of the season was Andre Hoffmann , with the result also , there would not be the two oppos@@ ites at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to better fit in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the tri@@ erk@@ ette should also be further optimized .
&quot; and a gate after a free , the For@@ tun@@ s want to be also no longer resour@@ ce@@ ful . &quot;
for the future it will be so no longer beside Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line .
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team comes better after the experiences in preparation with the tri@@ ples , as with the four @-@ legged friend . &quot;
&quot; still I do not know how we are acting in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach of Fried@@ son Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is for sure , &quot; because we have just started in the tri@@ erk@@ ette on the semi @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann player who can set up the well &quot; , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ise and we don &apos;t afford so much mis@@ understand@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can speak after a lack of a mis@@ lun@@ ar start , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we d@@ ined on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly speak of a decent season . &quot;
he wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; the start into the season evaluated only after six to eight players , &quot; said Fried@@ helmet Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim pre@@ matur@@ ely had to be broken because of an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home play , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be something fresh , since they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent fav@@ oured into the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the defen@@ ders of the Fortuna . &quot;
&quot; while the guests come from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy favorite , on Sunday to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first sight , is cre@@ at@@ ness , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you must hit from pre @-@ in , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief . &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement , arro@@ gant and adul@@ ter@@ ous . &quot;
and so he wants to experience his player on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for the medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people were tested older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority on For@@ ens@@ ory medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ bel@@ li@@ et ) has begun with the performance of the tests last year .
&quot; they are supposed to make more precise during the asylum proceedings , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration flow ) because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees were critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rant 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; possibly is under 18 years old .
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases when the person has been judged for over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has under@@ gone over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det made the 5@@ 81 published results , she stated that in 243 these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical estim@@ ation , in x @-@ rays and MR@@ s are made of knee @-@ teeth , which are then analysed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they left sooner or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the kind of measurement should be used . &quot;
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to assess a child as an adult , is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk lies in it if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy emphasis was installed on the bridge at the eastern town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ ly , Bau@@ leiter at the Department of Road and Transport in the National Park Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , working at the same time began on all three rehabilitation @-@ need@@ y bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the building is scheduled for October and E@@ asi@@ ly , it is certain that the schedule is respected . &quot;
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge of concrete , which is disgu@@ ised with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; as the two other bridges also , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were established in 1939 and are twelve and respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
&quot; the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called fr@@ appe . &quot;
that is a random fix that is also used as operation .
the southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap .
then the pedestrian route is to be gone .
&quot; the special thing is that it is related to finished parts , a patent for the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ bran@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented br@@ aces .
special finger@@ tips has needed the set of lines by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a fiber cable , that many companies are connected . &quot;
local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and canc@@ ers had to be folded . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building of the building and the umbrella @-@ soft in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; is locked . &quot;
the cost of the three ro@@ ckets are € 700 000 .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ d in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it does not occur so frequently that parties go on a beach , but if it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell was invited to a poster of the large electoral board . &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to start the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who is together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forming the leading edge for the Bundestag on 24 September , and the dep@@ uty prime minister Be@@ at@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those , who are at the ground already hours before the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ d experts , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the city of picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now take place on the parking lot under the R@@ ond@@ ola - and therefore directly in front of those who come to the Af@@ ales event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that has to offer .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum A world and one of the relevant organizers , really pleased : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ d without problems &quot; , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police has many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , she shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ d have come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the Af@@ d Vol@@ can@@ fel : he has tried to make such an event and got the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there is a cancellation , because because of the already built of Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does : against 20 o &apos;clock in the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the rh@@ et@@ land @-@ called Af@@ D @-@ Chair Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners that wait for the leading class did@@ atin for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty prime minister Be@@ at@@ rix of Stor@@ ch their speeches hold . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; something more than one hour takes the Af@@ d event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but even there is short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;

&quot; a re@@ hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli there are in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the Kloster@@ kirche . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he meets a concert under the motto &quot; Schwarz@@ meer &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; Bal@@ let &quot; &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass instrumental music . &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European leaders .
this is the Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ cope is the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the limits of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; it sounds like Johann Sebastian Bach at the two like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ a@@ ean N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , mix classic , jazz and the free games to an intrigu@@ ing complete art@@ works . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was listed only this spring with ri@@ esi@@ astic success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has written it for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with her special acous@@ tics is deliberately involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about their bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled che@@ eses , and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart really openly on their bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; when I meet once in gri@@ lled che@@ eses , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes as neighbour@@ ly ? &apos; . &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Holl@@ y@@ ang stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson who eventually went bitter .
&quot; despite all that ass@@ ures the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ ator compared to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with whom I have been . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after its separation , Kri@@ sten was that they had bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and believed seriously in it . &quot;
so it has never distr@@ acted or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially these suffered them according to &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but in school hours , as they prefer to be like a Bu@@ b locker : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been very in@@ jured .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children , I would look like a bug . &quot;
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and sh@@ ame@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; now look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public , they don &apos;t like to have their love life : &quot; people expect you to have a certain way , and that anno@@ yed me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps I call me some inci@@ dental , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of things ... today I will tell you as a citizen of West Virginia . I can no longer help you when I am a democratic Gover@@ nor .
the r@@ ally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a great announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice endor@@ ses not the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was chosen in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes stand firm , that he has inherited K@@ ohl@@ em@@ inen in five states , and inherited from his father a coal business . &quot;
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can national committee on Thursday night gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party exchange of governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party which would be more likely to be working to be great in order to make our country again great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last ref@@ usal of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , close message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of CB@@ S News . &quot;
co@@ e lo@@ aves &quot; hon@@ or@@ able &quot; Russian excuse for intelligence @-@ sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse for Russia to a intelligence sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sport . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin during the IA@@ AF Congress World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he is determined to fight the doping .
&quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , those found in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the Forbidden , which was negotiated in November 2015 , after a report of the world anti @-@ doping agency ( W@@ ada ) had found references to nation@@ ally funded doping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was today a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ por@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the whole Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized itself , that they have experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said , he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will commence at the athle@@ tics world Championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the manager of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfil some of the criteria for a re@@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and neglected Trainer are still free , he said Re@@ por@@ ters in London after a presentation at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
Trau@@ t@@ act for Mali cr@@ ashed soldiers
&quot; during a trau@@ mas @-@ party in the northeast F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two were thought by a helicopter crash in Mali Um@@ ge@@ ed soldiers . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions .
&quot; at the still un@@ resolved crash , Secretary of Defence said by the Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) . &quot;
&quot; she drew the two um@@ my pil@@ ots , but as &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of her professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we tend to have been against this highest sacrifice , which they established in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen were born on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
her companions were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a Tot@@ ana of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral Saint Peter .
at noon we took only the relatives in the church departure .
&quot; after that , the grape party began in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the German army and politics . &quot;
below also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General Secretary of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; Trau@@ erg@@ ä@@ ste laid down ro@@ ses , the families stood in arm at the s@@ me@@ gen . &quot;
in front of the church F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; Secretary of Defense in the Le@@ yen made the str@@ ated soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and enter into sat@@ anic . &quot;
the Stab@@ er@@ pillar t@@ mann has built the air operation of the mar@@ tial drivers in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger @-@ pil@@ ots of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , to which the soldiers belong , explained : &quot; &quot; if these occupation could not turn off the crash , then there would not have been mo@@ genic . &quot;
a doubt about the UN Mission in Mali has not been revealed by the Le@@ yen : the commitment is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high significance &quot; for a country , by which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the trau@@ mas @-@ party the s@@ ut@@ ors were brought from the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information . &quot;
Prinz Hen@@ rik does not want a tomb next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried after his death next to his wife . &quot;
this shared the kingdom on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish empire is placed in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ g for the two .
the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband &apos;s decision to keep it further in the message .
&quot; where prince Hen@@ rik bury , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention of being attached to his French homeland .
prince Hen@@ rik never made a H@@ ehl made that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become King .
&quot; in 2016 he went into retirement , and also places the title &quot; &quot; princ@@ ess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark does not have the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief owners of the Danish kingdom . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be ultimately unclear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention of being attached to his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ sex , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
at the Thames he worked in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later woman the sympath@@ ie@@ gi@@ ants of the people always flew , prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy state in his under 50 years . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I was doing . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ aying , I preferred wine instead of beer , Sei@@ den@@ str@@ ü@@ e instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I scre@@ wed instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and have had the reputation here to be the brand @-@ critical intellectual intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
they were two mistakes ! &quot;
Premier W@@ eil wants a swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ ar Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country @-@ day , but he does not want . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising resign@@ ation of a Green MEPs from their country @-@ demand in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official appointment of the country @-@ election , the red @-@ green coalition lost in Hannover so that its scar@@ ce A @-@ vote in the Parliament reached the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ ests founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( des@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to its faction .
&quot; this means that CD@@ U and F@@ DP could have 69 seats in the Dutch @-@ Sax@@ on land , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new land@@ day will be elected regular on 14 January of the year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green country government must now decide whether to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan W@@ eil keeps it indispensable , that the country &apos;s day decides as rapidly as its self @-@ redemption . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday through her further action .
&quot; the provincial Constitution also sees the possibility that the country &apos;s Day ent@@ ails trust , and elect a successor . &quot;
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; these possibilities must be legally clean , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; you will discuss all questions , if legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ wards step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the Policy himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it was referred to as a tra@@ der of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the Ab@@ tr@@ unc@@ ge members to return their country &apos;s country .
&quot; we of course goes out of course that they have received their land@@ tag@@ and@@ at that she has received over the green national list , with immediate effect , divided the National President Meta Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the pres@@ idents of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
you have decided to become aware of no pr@@ on@@ unciation in the group .
&quot; even in the background that there was no cont@@ ent@@ ative differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ ed did@@ at Martin Schulz condemned the over@@ head of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ Members El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he suppor@@ tive the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) , which can quickly choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
the resign@@ ation of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; in her last van@@ ity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary of Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Nieder@@ sachsen makes this dirty In@@ tri@@ gen@@ game , trying to beat from it political capital . &quot;
&quot; low @-@ informed CD@@ U fra@@ gment Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his members , El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , bow@@ ed T@@ ests , with personality @-@ career as the result of the country @-@ election 2013 to fal@@ si@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the CD@@ U was the first power , SPD and green in the country before the SPD , but a hau@@ ch@@ thin majority of one voice . &quot;
&quot; agricultural ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ l , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) in an interview with the editorial network ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt - How can the consumer protect against poison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumers to look exactly the eggs in your refrigerator and review the stamp impression .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de the Bundes@@ länder will provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ ge .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after everything we know at present , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di is taking the best possible crisis action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ tening of the Federal Minister of Economics is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately been switched off and since announcement of Germany in close cooperation with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same way as producers to ensure that the sold @-@ selling products are in@@ capable and harmless .
&quot; if with eggs , the high level of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not open . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time is not the farms to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; after the time of knowledge , the production of production meets no immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , they must count on account of mut@@ ine@@ ous illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little controversy in harvest .
is it only missing on the staff or even at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , it was just the official controls that revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent clarification of such events and the delivery to the prosec@@ utor of the prosec@@ utor in the cases are of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made many times clear that I expect a complete education for the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular alarm m at the food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer &apos;s consumers have the right to get secure and secure food exclusively .
&quot; if a non @-@ related insec@@ ti@@ cide in the food industry is used , consumer and consumers are rightly om@@ itted . &quot;
&quot; the ased resources are manufacturers , traders and consumers come into a situation which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cides Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the attitude of food products is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
it must be consistent and worked with high @-@ pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic facts will be swi@@ f@@ tly and clari@@ fied .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ restricted expenditure on the European foot@@ ball@@ ers , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to offer cre@@ ws from the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair @-@ play rules , which was launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G eventually has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar without great losses has been financed . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 Million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its treaty , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will be several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure the money easily get to make N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him into another galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich Herr@@ scher@@ family of Qatar . &quot;
clubs are allowed to address a lot of money for the purchase of players but have to counter@@ act with legitimate enc@@ um@@ ance sources that allow them to break the break @-@ up point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election as the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs that have taken tremendous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ki@@ ed to ruin , when banks or owners have withdrawn their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on debt debt to the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the model model that the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vich was originally bought in Chelsea - a club with potential and then vigor@@ ated to build a global brand and build a global brand .
&quot; during the current triple @-@ year period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A success@@ ors Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ an continues to take place from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly is FF@@ P not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , in comparison to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its treaty . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a record contract for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.3 million euros in the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the hard@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a sum of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the cre@@ denti@@ als of the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could attempt to over@@ see their financial supervision by combining their revenue by companies , which are linked to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ical company could not exceed the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not apply as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A chose that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was paraly@@ sed by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the Organ@@ iz@@ ations of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar could come .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have passed that N@@ ey@@ mar WM ambassador will become and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could simply figure out .
&quot; the recent sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , every attempt to consider the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , sag@@ as on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 5@@ 4@@ 2.@@ 4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsorship De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ kot@@ ellers . &quot;
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move , by declar@@ ing that PS@@ G would hurt FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financed intelligence &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to cat@@ ars of the official owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a State that financed a society . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect financial Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shot supplier
in the past few years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate is made for the Swiss .
&quot; now , the close cooperation is facing a possible end : the airline writes the order . &quot;
&quot; Swiss @-@ speaking in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency SD@@ A , a corresponding report on the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will open a new treaty in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current suppliers Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
around 17 million small red colored Sho@@ gg@@ it@@ af@@ ers are distributed to 14 grams per year the flight esc@@ ort in front of the landing to the passengers .
the Swiss does not want to make information about the cost .
&quot; the volume of industry appreci@@ ates the contract volume according to &quot; northern Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; however , more important is all of the adver@@ t @-@ effects : for a sh@@ og@@ y manufacturer it is a pres@@ et job . &quot;
how many applicants are giving on the new tender the Swiss will not want to betra@@ y .
but only Swiss manufacturers come in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
for the SD@@ A the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not accessible to an opinion .
chocolate boards distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before the Swiss was completed a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry Cal@@ leb@@ aut had supplied with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss was introduced two and a half years with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ line flights , customers of the First Class with goo@@ dies will be spoiled by the Con@@ f@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class Nas@@ chen passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; also on the short track , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class . &quot;

&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as a franchise , it feels like the time was just below . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it enth@@ uses an original story for a speaking D@@ ose vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; playing at the core of the go@@ ings - actor @-@ sized ages play dirty children , who grow up - they nevertheless made the im@@ possibility to gain the final part of the wid@@ get . &quot;
&quot; ten years of L@@ ater , with his adults , who now play adults is less emotional @-@ rooted and its par@@ o@@ dy &apos;s more after the found@@ ational principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker @-@ Films of the 90 @-@ er years such as &quot; The Hand , Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , the cradle &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point inn@@ itus , a character by a Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ ck ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) still not forgotten . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy de@@ mal@@ ign@@ ant P@@ lot to be involved in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ ck ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good idea of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the ex@@ courses are the best part of the franchise .
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ illons Under@@ li@@ ppen@@ che from &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; , &quot; his former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy has now feel like an old cris@@ p . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of accidental mad@@ ness that could get this franchise , as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches that which I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; his last scene will show the gang of &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; meanwhile recalls a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ kampf @-@ I@@ kon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Brian Gat@@ ewood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , there is a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main tro@@ lling - a hard sc@@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon levels have been syn@@ ced in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice G@@ ags for viewing ( the police spend time to watch chess on TV , how Americans are doing it with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ ers@@ hal@@ a Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ bites Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; voice out &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is so very committed to the truths of a des@@ perate propaganda , a mur@@ derer who is a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it is often as one single playing . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it draws itself and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; which has been re@@ acted to a lower length , its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re will always supply the American message , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who disappeared a pi@@ le of ham@@ burger . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything as a for@@ age for a gel .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
blow against drugs @-@ m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow , in the Black @-@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen , and Stuttgart , numerous objects passed away like the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office on Friday . &quot;
15 cap@@ tives were arrested between 25 years and 77 and have already been arrested in arrest warran@@ t against this .
&quot; in addition , the officials presented greater quantities marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same razor in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German Ar@@ rest War@@ rant .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
at the promotion Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators were involved .
total were over 300 polic@@ emen in use .
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia will be organised drug crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , tried murder as well as smoking and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the Prosec@@ utor &apos;s office for the organised drug trading in the South German area has already been determined . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ utor in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ator of the N@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the major use on the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ et was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the studies , there were primarily Italian national institutions with a relationship to the Italian Maf@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also an incident on 27 May in hips , during the early morning several shots were lo@@ osed into a guest house , likely to go to the account of the Ban@@ de . &quot;
way lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens who should not appear , &quot; : &quot; according to the report , the foreig@@ ner @-@ register in Germany has considerable shortcomings . &quot;
this lead to partly gra@@ vi@@ ous mis@@ decisions in asylum proceedings .
&quot; the agent responsible for the refugee management of the German federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen manner , has thus been attentive to a media report on large gaps in the country &apos;s international register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the given recorded data could result in asylum proceedings and deportation &quot; to partly serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; &quot; warned &quot; in an analysis , which is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the property , the information is estimated 10 million people with foreign citizenship , including 5,@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data will be managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data have not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts so far has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and no longer show up in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data files can significantly slow &quot; &quot; reverse processes &quot; , &quot; it is called the report to continue . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on hard@@ ships , the EU citizens are seized , who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; but such false agen@@ das led , however , led to a distor@@ ted debate on the dealing with out@@ lining , it is said in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started to return refugee families with under 16 years old children back to Italy when they travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ cker newspaper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , the BAM@@ F will carry such procedures &quot; for families with children - except for inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 through . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin treaty , the EU is responsible for refugees from the EU . &quot;
&quot; when a migration travel to another EU country , this state can withdraw him to the entry . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds write the office now : &quot; meanwhile , the capacity of families with min@@ der@@ ous children in Italy is greatly increased . &quot;
Italy made for the recording and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) do not hold these commitments for adequate .
also other EU states would send refugees back to the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the inn@@ ate political spokes@@ person in the Lin@@ ks@@ fra@@ gment in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ w@@ ager because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system un@@ lawful terms and a haz@@ ard of cinema . &quot;
furthermore the result is achieved
a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people showed blood @-@ away service for other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now divided up to 50 lit@@ res of blood by now in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the church in the session of the congregation are the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is genius as our body is laid out and we z@@ ollen the don@@ ators respect which make their blood for strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; underlined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ind@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood sp@@ ying helps several people , explained the rot@@ ter manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preser@@ ves will cr@@ ush into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
in this way three people could benefit from a blood sp@@ ilt .
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported by the actions that are carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 don@@ ators the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K roundabout . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to theatre comes from a few years ago to a higher number of participants . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Reich@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta um@@ beer was awarded to the multi@@ tudes and were awarded for each 50 made blood don@@ ates for each . &quot;

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will likely be announced later that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation will have ste@@ ered over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; as they held the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members an increase , since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly review , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.@@ 7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on fiscal income would continue to continue , whereby inflation in autumn is likely to rise to almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they were sign@@ alized that in the next few years Z@@ inser@@ tion would be necessary to grow the inflation of the Bre@@ xit , and she said that the l@@ ending costs may need more than expected to rise to the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; members also agreed to return a part of the Mam@@ mut Revolution@@ ists , which was issued before a year after the Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will require time for financial recovery plan to provide for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on interest rates , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak as soon as pressure on the real income of households continues to use the consumption . &quot;
&quot; repeti@@ tive to the interest rates repeated that &quot; &quot; a certain imp@@ lication of monetary policy &quot; &quot; would be required for cooling the inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; extent than the markets await . &quot;
&quot; the markets predic@@ t the first increase in the third quarter of the next year , and another in 2020 . &quot;
&quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected in comparison with the 1.9 % , and 1.9 % compared to the last year . &quot;
she predicted to keep up to 1.8 % in the year 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell on these news to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0,5 % to 1.1 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent betra@@ yal growth , after the last quarter of 0,@@ 2 % in the previous three months have risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected in the third quarter at 0.3 % , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent In@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary report provided little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and slight increase heights , as the sharpen@@ ing of the first will get worse before they then repaired . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years can not &quot; &quot; prevent the income of income &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages to the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy will also be strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ unds , which is compensated for a part of lower consumption . &quot;
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the ham &apos;s ham .
the Bank appreci@@ ates that it is likely to take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; in front of the last judgement of the Bank to the interest rates the reputation was increased by pressure , since inflation increased to pressure on hard @-@ driven households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July requested an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has declined last month of 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the bank said that this has been expected and will be back in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the crossing in relation to their goal of 2 % may be &quot; very &quot; the weak Po@@ unds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ ally Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent withdrawal of S@@ wap R@@ ates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive once again , since the l@@ ender is lou@@ dly searching for shops and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing De@@ als run and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to be disp@@ ens@@ ored HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people &quot;
patients will be obtained from September following a fight before the High Court against financing of the medicine in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; transformation &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one prior to the intercourse in@@ ex@@ propri@@ ation pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) which can reduce the inf@@ ectivity risk of around 86 percent , now from healthcare service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ al Tribunal had confirmed a sentence on the Court of Justice last year , after the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the box announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ Chef Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; major new intervention &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) . &quot;
&quot; sexual health hospitals in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first one who will allow registration of people and further clinics will follow in October 2018 will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
prevention of pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicines which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduces the HIV transmission by inf@@ ectivity of inf@@ ectivity .
taking Pr@@ EP before intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or just two hours before intercourse .
&quot; those who come for treatment in question include gay , bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics will identify appropriate participants who agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a house doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the drugs during this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by generating clinical evidence , as it is targeted on a large scale , recorded and implemented . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to preventing HIV and overcome them .
&quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted on the need@@ y and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed trial in England , to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not inter@@ connected with a partner that leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority now has to be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP Test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected persons . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after monthly delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government and over@@ due . &quot;
evidence of how transformations these drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can terminate the transmission of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is done as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect persons , the HIV infected , and that they contribute to contributing to the proliferation of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I searched for something , that was comparable to my price . &quot;
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with them and made a quote on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square miles has been fully over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room estate with a welded layout - you had to go through the kitchen to go into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my request , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she ordered the architecture and designer Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill that 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms to place one another , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the default .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ thrown , without having to b@@ bing ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to lay the steel so that he had the right height above or down . &quot;
this arrangement could place Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic clut@@ ch window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold @-@ furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both En@@ den is mir@@ r@@ ored a short corridor to make him longer work .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feel like a window into another room .
at the entrance is mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all h@@ edge and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ able space , the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went out there , &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ er M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is essential so that when you push the door high , very easily g@@ heads . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and a calculation based on the ground @-@ size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor space and to use the same time high quality materials , which gives the space to its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not lose yourself in the electric power plugs in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
&quot; it shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design , and increased square meters of something standards into something completely different . &quot;
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this . &quot;
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollars
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation because of one of the largest real estate imperial Vic@@ tori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their ownership and their assets shall be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw himself from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation is held in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , brothers had collected 38 real estate in value of over half a billion dollars , since the family had bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the Family West@@ co Je@@ ans founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold to 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in town center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - was described by Paul as &quot; &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company of the company and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; legal proceedings , that this means that col@@ in property bears the value of 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars . &quot;
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be the same for Paul as issues .
&quot; the distri@@ butions proposed by Col@@ in proposed him with the left , which I kept for the best objects , he wrote in 2015 in a first monkey av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , refused him . &quot;
&quot; argu@@ ed that this is not true , but he raises Paul to manage some possessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early monkey av@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to put the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with monkey av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides in law firm . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 @-@ he years , and in the early seven@@ ties they bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in the Col@@ in the first je@@ ans of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co , when he was in the high school in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that they and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me , that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark were paid when leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke as well as Mark are , &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; became bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really cannot say much , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very sad , very sad that my brother Paul decided to disgu@@ ise me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in writing to the Court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not want that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be gone .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;

maybe John F. Kelly can actually do .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
Poli@@ tico reports that the new rod of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tru@@ mp - including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss at a more even@@ ly course .
here is a piece by Re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new staff of the White House , on his first working day with leading staff , he asked a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House that he wants to repair : bad information that came into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brie@@ f@@ ings because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ore Tru@@ mp by super@@ v@@ ise his media . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television dates decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince him , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to hold Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter @-@ habit among control , according to six former election officials in it , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter @-@ habit ever &quot; under control &quot; was ridic@@ ulous . &quot;
perhaps these struggle of campaign don &apos;t know something we had@@ n &apos;t know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets had even more igni@@ tion to contain more igni@@ tion .
&quot; we will probably never learn anything about the ti@@ ets , the Tru@@ mp has not sent . &quot;
&quot; if his staff made it some times to hold it away from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has to prevent it consistently , that Tru@@ mp chec@@ ker calls forth . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem lies in finding that people in a white house , which brings up from competing parties , always try to move their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp Material , which may potentially support their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this history - told in May about the preference of consultants , the President of strategic reasons , beyond doubt . &quot;
this was an example which was described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp be@@ amer said that Tru@@ mp can respond to negative press cuts , especially those with corrupt le@@ aks and that it deri@@ ves out how these originate . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone called the president mal@@ icious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ vocation . Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; &quot; the source behind a pi@@ le to be of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
although Johnson was banned from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he vo@@ ke the false accus@@ ations in the past and vo@@ ke it .
Tru@@ mp read the article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then pole Stab@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the pap@@ er@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and its consultants are still looking for influence . &quot;
these in@@ changing factors make cellars of mission very difficult .
masters of Mast@@ cher get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the people of the population will pray and hoped . &quot;
the police in all of Europe will be ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to hazardous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the requested sword @-@ crus@@ hers are not well known , references from the population will be hoped and pray . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that is following the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Advent calendar from winter .
&quot; the experiences have shown that many wings of the resort were hiding , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 European countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website has been viewed www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ers , more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online gest@@ ures could not be arrested , at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; Million@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again and again with some resol@@ ute travellers on war fu@@ ß , who have negotiated one from the church to return a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire @-@ Series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of travelling , after they were dropped only in May , without having been removed from one by the Council to prevent their inci@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defensive systems , and oppressed their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot;
&quot; mis@@ cellaneous inhabitants have oppres@@ ses the council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &apos; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They are on the afternoon after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they have thrown stones onto the pas@@ sers . &quot;
the Council needs to be forced by shame to implement the action since it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were moved in May there and are now back again .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it , keeping a long instruction to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the streets brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my comm@@ uter , if the Council may not stop it once . &quot;
&quot; a local people who did not want to be called : &quot; it is ridic@@ ulous we just saw the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
this time the numbers have increased and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a speaker at the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a perpet@@ rated camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our argument collection , it is very important that many residents report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court needs to check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof , by the then ambience operating company mbH and 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights went lost per year and also revenues from the city tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatically rising the numbers of refugees who were in the district , the hotel building served as a collective accommodation , provided for controversy over controversy . &quot;
the city prevented accommodation of asylum seekers through the setting of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Lie@@ uten@@ ant Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location , and spoke back then by more serious prospective buyers to the house . &quot;
he should reserve the right .
the Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ausen with chair@@ men of Bir@@ g@@ it Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been in front of the entrance for some time ago , and when you enter the house , a lot of renov@@ ations will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were demol@@ ished , ceilings partly built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the black style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk showers , the entrance area is converted , new windows are built . &quot;
&quot; everything was later &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you do not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to stand wide , explains Sch@@ erer continues . &quot;
&quot; both individual travelers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Direc@@ tor Michael Kr@@ ause he was already guided .
the ideas of the city are fr@@ ameworks with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to determine not exactly this . &quot;
&quot; under a million euros , it expects . &quot;
&quot; the outdoor facilities are also brought to foreground , this is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us Special Jury sets the Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires to U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp , special winner of Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; the panel was included in the work in the past weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; with appeal to the subject of familiar persons . &quot;
the paper examines the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified its investigation .
&quot; the CN@@ N broad@@ casts , it already reported the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. secret services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer to have been targeted in the presidential struggle in 2016 .
&quot; Mu@@ eller studied , whether there was a distinction between Tru@@ mp@@ s El@@ ectiv@@ es team and Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the focus of investigations , several men should stand in the election campaign as consultants of the re@@ public@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; according to report , Mu@@ eller got more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment under the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Tru@@ mp Tru@@ mp was personally moved to the center and seek the accus@@ ation under whether the president may hin@@ dered the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to prove this evidence in possible waste cases and decide whether the indictment is to be raised .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called Ank@@ hing chambers .
&quot; mostly , they are switched on when it concerns larger and controversy cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched from the prosec@@ utor to re@@ charge persons with pus .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N Sender , the inv@@ itations were already exhibited , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; besides Tru@@ mp j@@ r. also Tru@@ mp@@ s advis@@ ors and son @-@ son J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his dam@@ al@@ iger electoral manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort continued by talking . &quot;
&quot; right wing extremis@@ m said on Thursday night in the US television , that the composition shows that Mu@@ eller won &apos;t be intim@@ id@@ ated in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the replacement of the Gre@@ mi@@ um was the beginning of a new phase in the studies and a new reason to concern president Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday night took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the subject will give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else about whom they can talk . &quot;
&quot; his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he tells nothing of the replacement of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this also usually work in secret , stres@@ sing . &quot;
the White House feared all measures that accelerated the work of the special @-@ party in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI Chief James Com@@ ey made three times that I will not be determined against the president .
&quot; you have no reason to accept that something changed , it was in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; Mu@@ eller was first used , after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been frozen . &quot;
&quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp were lou@@ dly , he wants to hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp was asked for an adjustment of investigations against the former national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; according to the presentation of US media , the White House gathered the White House against the special press and its employees . &quot;
the sol@@ dering spec@@ ulation about it whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release .
&quot; unlike an independent special rank of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later returned President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which it theoretically could be folded to the president of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bend such a step but prevention .
two groups of re@@ publi@@ can and democratic Sen@@ ators presented on Thursday &apos;s ref@@ usal in which the special er@@ ers could no longer be released so easily .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic ice cream drives in the Ant@@ arctic
in the West@@ ant@@ arctic has solved itself a gigantic ic@@ eberg of the close size of Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Oce@@ anic Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the large col@@ os@@ um heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large col@@ lo@@ be now moved to the north and probably will need two , three years until he was mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it is recorded with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ice r@@ ust , which researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; what extent the climate change has played a role in the break@@ age of ice , is unclear . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual clas@@ hes of ice sh@@ es in the region for about 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the broken col@@ on has so far been a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by great gl@@ aci@@ ers .
so it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula .
North of this swe@@ ep was the balance of wax and ab@@ rupt a few years ago .
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is was there to be broken , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is quite a lot that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate is available in voltage and can be broken , if at a key@@ point one piece . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , because they float on the water and pus@@ hes ice so much water as it arises after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the swe@@ ep leads to that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in low dimensions , writes the British research project to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is after AW@@ I @-@ indications with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the vi@@ cal fi@@ el@@ fe@@ is of Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
&quot; in the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge of the open ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it will be regularly off .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and is not aware of direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most widespread withdrawal from the beginning of the record , &quot; confirmed also . &quot;
&quot; among scientists he disp@@ uted whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now going to grow again or in the long run , and possibly merge together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but these developments will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers did not withdraw the departure of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , in recent decades , there have been a lot of ice sh@@ el@@ ves of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula in recent decades . &quot;
this long finish of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica covers the direction of South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Ant@@ arctic Survey , the polar surface of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula has declined since the 1950s at 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
the decline has contributed to the decline in temperature .
&quot; in the past 50 years , the Ant@@ arctic peninsula has grown around three degrees to reach around three degrees , in which the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes more difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U calls to step out of the employer @-@ association to become more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the K@@ rei@@ day started 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the management office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 appren@@ tices have reached their first working day . &quot;
the teachers in the circle are apparently very popular .
around 620 applicants were to be recorded in vain for the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is missing , in order to cope with the raised requirements and tasks . &quot;
currently there are still at the district M@@ ett@@ mann as 50 did not occupied in places .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative in the K@@ rei@@ day together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and to enter the qualified angel in the administration .
the management should develop a concept for recruitment and personal development according to the desire of the parties . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of specialists , but future @-@ oriented to the applicant , says it . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this already sounds like a good approach .
&quot; for the circle has to do it with personal problems , which you did not know earlier . &quot;
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer attractive terms .
the speech is given by a rule @-@ right &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; to this end , a high number of employees , the disease or age may be eliminated from the service . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time for action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Genti@@ les , leader of the CD@@ U , continues with his party even beyond the common request . &quot;
he was already very long ago in the K@@ rei@@ day for a lazy surprise when he was publicly presented by the personnel administration and the rest of the parties .
people want to be checked that all possibilities are checked that allow a resign@@ ation from the Commun@@ al Emplo@@ yers Federation .
&quot; if we haven &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county government should be aiming for trade unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a bon@@ st@@ ari@@ f . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CD@@ U attempts to pay better the employees and officials to better pay the collective service for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exact , enhancements or more money is available only if you change to a higher level , which is oriented to professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution Act . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ tor Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ ten the tone into NGO @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has NGOs who use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue to continue , if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t write any new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ niti@@ s warning came a day , after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ ur@@ ry &apos; , because their team had effectively worked with men &apos;s hands in a way that ligh@@ tened illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation that has only been in operation for a year , rejected it to express itself on the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian Public Prosec@@ utor Cart@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ o@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all accus@@ ations , which are currently being raised , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; youth re &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , which has been monitored since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his crew will take H@@ ose @-@ migrants on board , which can be delivered directly from men &apos;s hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gler can be used again so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting , supposedly , just 1,@@ 3 miles before the Libyan coast took place , according to the Act of the Prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is dil@@ uted , over the authority of the Italian coastal weakness , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not of any other motiv@@ ations monitored . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have above all an Italian police officers on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations , have so far to be explained to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be useless , but acceptable , since they would not bring &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organization doctors without limits ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti said meanwhile , that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy , went strongly in the last weeks , that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and the cooperation with local civil liberties have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last few days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali through action to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
An@@ sti@@ ege and tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Palat@@ inate , to enjoy four days of walking and sightseeing . &quot;
there were three be@@ am@@ ples guides available to this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burgundy and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome .
the first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed viewing points , partly to towers , from which you could look far beyond the forests and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were more and again leng@@ th@@ ents for the long run . &quot;
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim on the Sal@@ ine and the popular saus@@ age market .
&quot; again , the view to the lookout point , joined by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days there were again many high altitude metres .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and revers@@ ed have brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ met@@ en the bi@@ ker in the free@@ ze content of cur@@ ating Sole .
also new town was established .
&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 m meters , the group had met the Pf@@ alz forest from its best - sporty and cultur@@ ally - met . &quot;
console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga set up for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars in future prior to computer consoles rather than moving through wind and weather on the stadium ?
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long gone to a serious field , has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high G@@ agen included . &quot;
&quot; these have also recognized the first federal ga@@ des , which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded in the middle of July an e @-@ sport department and took two professionals for the games of FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to am@@ a@@ ze new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Board of Jo@@ chen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; it is certain that in this turn , he is still able to climb several clubs . &quot;
&quot; the upcoming weekend , the football World Championship in London organizes the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; where the Gam@@ er of various clubs can compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , such as Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain , or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer from Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real soccer must deal in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract , one could be more often more often on these markets than once a year to send the federal union to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; at the e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; or just the football simulation award FIFA on competitive level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sport as well , Li@@ gen established , in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian @-@ country , e @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the idea is safe for the need@@ y . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has a long time to deal with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ tion@@ School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions that one can also find in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress actions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; besides , there is cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ er should exercise not only on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet . &quot;
&quot; the flying player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , f@@ ain@@ ting looks also problems : &quot; &quot; intelligence is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult to manage in online games and in the scene failed the structures of the classic sport .
scientists highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are on the road internationally , this is like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study of management consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , in Germany , 2016 has been implemented 50 million euros , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot;
sales in three years should be compared to 130 million .
&quot; against the nearly 2,@@ 4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is a little bit . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are already a number of countries .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball ho@@ op O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez at the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports participate .
Hollywood actor Ashton Car@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sport @-@ competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe a lot is doing .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a class , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ speaking clubs are obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management Board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
only to fall in nostal@@ gia and to clear the old times is no longer enough today .
&quot; it is about to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time align the company on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; also means Dut@@ y . &quot;
&quot; since one cannot stick to it , that only at football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that push the Con@@ rad Roy for su@@ icide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to currency . &quot;
Carter was condemned in June for the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy that took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free up to the appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representations argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red p@@ ants and a cre@@ am@@ eless bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards eyes , when it was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor of the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has no representation shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter attorney said , it is a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she is totally de@@ plor@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find out that her &quot; age or tyre @-@ bike or even her spirits have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there is &quot; no day , in which I may not wor@@ sen the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I would like that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters there is to be there . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys Si@@ ster &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they will never be part of the knowledge &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; that they will never be part of the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person having been together with which I had been together for each day since my birth , is a pain I always remember for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to place a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to call for su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a hydro@@ mon@@ ary det@@ oxi@@ fication in a vehicle .
&quot; the case drew national attention to itself , after car@@ dinal text messages revealed that they had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging thee , springs of a building , do you know yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she was sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot;
&quot; look ahead of his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All that you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy , and believed that it should be benef@@ ited by some press . &quot;
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few people defended the Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in Italy because of the murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ im@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua allowed K@@ im@@ me to run at the Audi Cup as captain , is no coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner has won a great season - Extra motivation is not det .
&quot; what was different from his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua K@@ im@@ me immediately , even if the extra gar@@ ment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide at the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself drunk at the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; re@@ told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the one could have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach could also interpret .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the youth of youth , debut , and just chosen from the holiday of professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader , but he was chosen . &quot;
&quot; su@@ gar@@ be@@ et , one gets the most loved ones to those who love to hold in mood . &quot;
&quot; so who had chosen , the heritage of lam@@ m can be found , a small extra @-@ motivation can only have good use . &quot;
&quot; I confirmed , &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday fl@@ ashed the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
&quot; right behind , this is now his position , the white bin@@ der on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , k@@ im@@ me in this start formation like the one who can take the helm in the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view of the whole , while many others were engaged with themselves . &quot;
&quot; Vid@@ al therefore , to over@@ play its lack of fitness ( fol@@ te hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches are to tie out to the devil and get out to the achievements of Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ dable also limited ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver thus , to fall into their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ kot . &quot;
this nevertheless came out very well .
&quot; sometimes beside K@@ im@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the deportation , both acted sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was frequently used , in addition , the addic@@ tive tried to develop a few times also in the game building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy gave the result , that the result was not as we had hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; shift , temp@@ o @-@ change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bavaria world is still for the new accessible , one saw in connection with the partitions . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
K@@ im@@ mir saw a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard a interesting sentence , &quot; &quot; what goes here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; at Bavaria , you simply have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he must not take the New Testament anymore . &quot;

company happy with rh@@ et@@ land @-@ care ministers : economy praise Wis@@ er Tempo
&quot; it often designed to be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor economics in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than one year in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ ends at the same time the old prime minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing att@@ aches the wishes of the economy to the Lem@@ ke all blocks . &quot;
the biggest K@@ ehr@@ twen@@ de sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the L@@ ück@@ en@@ closure of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the top list of the country .
&quot; this year , the ministry is hoping to be a plan of planning , up to 2021 the building is right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um Trier , which stands in the urgent need for the roadmap . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the route in December 2020 , says ministries in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post for regional , but international competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier stri@@ ves , as stimulated by Wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate @-@ Label to increase the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Wis@@ sing I have an open ear for people who want to create a separate company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier will see an additional incentive for young trainees , says the Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
it is intended to make a premium of 1000 euro for the constitu@@ tive master of the championship and 2500 Euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master education .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; during the planned road building , be fast facts to create , at the same time mis@@ placed it out of the country of the necessary staff , says Jan Campan@@ auer , principal business leaders of the Chamber of Commerce Trier . &quot;

&quot; Audi is intended to change 80@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face with a bac@@ kl@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ ,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ Chair said , the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving limits , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limiting . &quot;
Daim@@ ler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automobile manufacturers , equipment for neutr@@ alization of the vessels of diesel vehicles to be installed , also take that which makes it difficult to hold the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indic@@ ted to ignore the powerful car companies and to ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen to regulate the use of so @-@ called down@@ alt devices , reducing emissions , if a car has been tested , but under normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former leader of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery , and could be put forward in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigation into Volkswagen , after the authorities had re@@ inde@@ b@@ ted a system to deal with emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be Volkswagen difficult to charge : the luxury car manufacturer carries out , proportional to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ dill@@ o was temporarily one of the best @-@ published Cart@@ oon carto@@ onists who have been hall@@ marks of his figures .
also with 85 features the Argent@@ inian Argent@@ inian and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he proposed himself as a drawing label for happiness cards - what was frustr@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when he lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris ended to the end of the 60@@ s of breakthrough : with the release of his Cart@@ o@@ ons in &quot; Paris match &quot; and then in the &quot; &quot; Star &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China there was Mor@@ dill@@ o many fans .
again and again the artist of cities is inspired .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dill@@ o @-@ figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the shooting tower by Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; according to the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing , she works on a daily basis almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches find his dro@@ ple@@ t figures continue to spread much spread worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures .
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any arbitrary animal in its drawings - that has an exchange of exchange as a counter@@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , the 2019 will be coming to the chin @-@ screen . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ dill@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , it is set up rather on the TV series , which is produced as its original design@@ ations . &quot;
la@@ vender of Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ vender is because of the lack of dro@@ ught conditions and because of the diseases transferred insects , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to find major head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the agr@@ arian Institute &apos;s CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ vender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change during the last years , which has brought much less rain in spring and fall much more in the fall . &quot;
this has effects on the lifetime of la@@ vender .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the d@@ warf , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ vender oil is not only recommended for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of having a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ ENT@@ W@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have fewer parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered , are a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the black@@ outs from the ground , but also the b@@ umps of plants with a protective mix of tone and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the Weekly Rio@@ do@@ ce usually meet with their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state Z@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ stopp@@ able drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
&quot; it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children to the office , who were in 2009 the target of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot;
&quot; they kindly ask the re@@ porter , name for each column - no proof is needed , percep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal . &quot;
&quot; there are drug regul@@ ators , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als , which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest on the violence , and throughout the country the corp@@ ses have gone : at least 25 , since president En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing by attacks and threats , and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , their editor and their inspir@@ ator of Rio@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence will be deeply received , although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its Middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; s I@@ barra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , T @-@ shirts , who present his smiling face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porter discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 was established by a Son@@ der @-@ federal government in order to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the committee on the protection of journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of kill@@ ings that are associated with drug dealers and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will only be judged on trial . &quot;
&quot; in Rio@@ do@@ ce they still exist still to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ tr@@ ine , and although the terrain is now still tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ barra . &quot;
&quot; it is very fool@@ ish to squ@@ ander my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we susp@@ ect all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Rio@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presum@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with &quot; &quot; twelve flow &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove out in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and the delivery in the United States in January was Z@@ alo@@ a to become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as ri@@ vals are struggling to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of discounted , two @-@ storey maus@@ ol@@ een for drug royal , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes into the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Rio@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of a interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ els in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have ex@@ pedi@@ ed the sons , suspected gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second fault lay in it , Val@@ dez did not force them , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country into his own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he survived his friends and colleagues so long that he would always be there .
&quot; he was active as a senior re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues on the foundation of Rio@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journalism without b@@ ang on the ru@@ d@@ ote problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of the brave and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter loved it , hard @-@ to publish tests without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories , which nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Rio@@ do@@ ce they received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history , where ever they led . &quot;
he gave us voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J . &quot;
&quot; drug stores in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you must assume the task that falls you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many tactics ... why did you not say what happened before ? &quot;
&quot; the Rio@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was like a port workers , the friend , the generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher , who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ n@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and there are always sitting at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now , ask them : was his love for the routine of his hei@@ r ? &quot;
his death also forced them to ask their own assumptions in question how they can best do their work and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret grid - and cross @-@ railways &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
to trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , said the editor of Rio@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are not considered in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as did in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where an toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Rio@@ do@@ ce was met for security training , suddenly there were no phones allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , used for monitoring journalists and activ@@ ist in Mexico . &quot;
outside searched two polic@@ emen protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Rio@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ story area of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ porter in@@ quired about , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen which the governor himself did not be trusted . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drugs ties are under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Rio@@ do@@ ce has caught on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an exit to the government spending , focused on the hom@@ etown of the Gover@@ nor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the office , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who has been kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows , that the restaurant is a favorite venue by drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter was made from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which was almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
recently several pr@@ i @-@ Govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat asked the re@@ porter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this e@@ at@@ ery , including a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man a military over@@ fall . &quot;
only a few months before had the reader had seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we had already known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez became a storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , which are dedicated against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something that they themselves had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ riam C@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning , because of another journalist at the office of the office . &quot;
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country journalists have become lau@@ re@@ ast of journalists by being organized in organized prot@@ esters &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; on walking paths and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away from Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused Ram@@ i@@ rez accused of authorities , journalists , and let them move , because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has asked since then that she is re @-@ divided by the government , because she is worried that her anger has violated its objectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico from organised crime , involved with government ministers and a simultaneous society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co journalist &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security forces , with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico @-@ face you , because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern part of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ etas Card : &quot; &quot; I am here because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keys and ear@@ phones are beside her separated head .
&quot; some stores have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern part of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others do continue as El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug card with a Edit@@ orial page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ?
some journalists are left out of their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile and they still observe the streets and are looking for dangers .
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it was obviously murdered by the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who want to stay back and continue work , it is a daily dance with risky choices . &quot;
&quot; I@@ barra , who once wanted to be poet , gives him that the drug @-@ making him sc@@ ares him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that is why I became re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already terminated , the editors of Rio@@ do@@ ce stood at the side@@ walk in front of the office and tran@@ ken beer , when all their phones began to beat . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ ing and security forces near the seaside Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ate further as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the on @-@ board edge they have published the news on the website of Rio@@ do@@ ce via cell phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens near to - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen , the guards kept to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
if they were afraid of all they did not show it .
&quot; under the vast portrait of the fallen Grün@@ ders of the newspaper , whose cent@@ finger was visible for quite sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Rio@@ do@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only remember it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if on the same day when Javier was murdered , the practic@@ ant asked me to send them to the street reporting . &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ften its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue though a scary .
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable Nas@@ horn of a Canadian Berg@@ worker have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the dinosau@@ r &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even find that his g@@ ly skin of red@@ dish Braun was - and they said , they could have had something of a &quot; &quot; quiet past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; the bes@@ po@@ ised dinosau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well preserved state has researchers , who can describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic is the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant vor@@ es the best preserved Fossi@@ l of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn F@@ unk when he was near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something from the surrounding rock of mistake at the board , and decided to look more precisely . &quot;
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years , the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) serious Erd@@ kl@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ ded a little with eyes , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; said the captain Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ ack@@ l Museum where the creature is seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ rs copies , the mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this crop is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank , probably from meat e@@ aters dinosau@@ rs was threatened . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age , to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technology that is known as a bac@@ kl@@ at@@ ment that is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to mix themselves better in its surroundings and to so@@ ften its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ ack@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta marked by Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta marked by a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing conservation of the specimen , Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ aments about his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the constell@@ ations , a widespread defensive method in animal @-@ rich , meaning that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the cont@@ act@@ ment is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far from far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted from sufficient pressure by meat , fres@@ cos dinosau@@ rs , that evolution was fav@@ ored the wear of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals , who use the con@@ cre@@ dence - think of deer , zeb@@ ras and p@@ ump@@ y animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which was sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong car@@ ni@@ vor@@ y behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs @-@ beasts have had been to have been &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was brown .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal in evidence of his life , including his cont@@ our fourth , to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the dinosau@@ rs died , when he died , moved into a river and turned into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with cont@@ ested skin , but also in three dimensions remains intact and the original form of the animal retains , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early sounds .
&quot; you do not need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the waste time was a time , when huge Ther@@ opo@@ lies , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ r , which were on two legs , the earth dra@@ gged . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terrible ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose recent findings appear in the journal &apos;s Current News , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was transferred to the death in the sea and in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn F@@ unk , when he was located on 21 March 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the bes@@ po@@ ised dinosau@@ r in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops made by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant vor@@ es was sw@@ amped by the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater con@@ cre@@ mation of the dinosau@@ rs keep his armor in exquisite detail .
&quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ ump@@ y pl@@ ated , pl@@ ated by the dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; how Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko was written for National Geo@@ graphic , is such a level of preservation so &apos; rarely as a gain in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I do it , the confusing it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y cor@@ ds , which carry the skull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right for@@ table is on his side , his five fingers crossed the top . &quot;
I can count the shed on his sole .
in the storm : mass@@ ac@@ aram@@ bol@@ ts on A@@ 8 : many wounded
intense accident on Thursday night on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are ent@@ an@@ gled in a mass am@@ bol@@ lar@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , long @-@ long sticks - and g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) arrived on the late Thursday morning at a mass@@ ac@@ aram@@ bol@@ age about 20 people .
&quot; after the first information of the police were at 17.00 between the connector , Adel@@ z@@ hausen und O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storms just below 30 cars , including even lor@@ ries . &quot;
above the exact number of the wounded there is no information available .
&quot; it is about light to moderate @-@ sized injuries , said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
a great advent of lif@@ egu@@ ard vehicles was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was locked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich one was formed approximately ten kilometres long back @-@ st@@ au .
&quot; like an A@@ Z @-@ re@@ porter , it also came to massive disability through a number of G@@ aff@@ s . &quot;
the fire @-@ fire notices the marks of the vehicle en@@ gen@@ res that are now to be expected with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. , then there was a second accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ ali@@ asing . &quot;
it came to a collision between an auto@@ ot@@ ran@@ spor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ in .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes an impro@@ per or rip the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
driving control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently manages the managed travel card control .
you simply confirmed by phone that you have taken place and de@@ valu@@ ated the ticket .
currently there is a test run on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , we extend it out . &quot;
&quot; it is then expected to be available in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the train the track record without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in order to use this , however , some conditions must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you also have to buy it via the app from the train , the DB Navigator software , which is the most convenient way of ticket sales . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : you rise in the train , calling up his ticket ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in the test customers a button will appear to electronic de@@ valuation .
the traction managers get a message on their mobile devices that the passenger is located on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
comes the traction guide at the ticket control to place y white he knows that there is a passenger with already cleaned online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who want to relaxed without Ticket@@ check by our draw staff , chec@@ s in the DB Navigator simply itself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management of DB Remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives track , knows that besides delays and pas@@ sions the driving controls are among the biggest nu@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case , one of the fellow trav@@ eller does not have all the documents that are needed for de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the ID of personnel are missing , or otherwise a document which you must have . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between draw companion and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the section or large area and delays while taking control of your own tickets and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also only on the links ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Brittany and Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken to her core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the one sat in St. Louis on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which rented it , and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
you stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child , and it still lies on the road , &quot; &quot; it was there . &quot;
&quot; confused as no one else had on their feed the information posted , she closed Facebook and opened on Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly wor@@ shipped on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper in the territory of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , M@@ on . &quot;
he post@@ ete a picture of Brow@@ n@@ ering body that was stretched on the street and stay there four hours .
&quot; it is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets through people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people , the shou@@ ted , and of a man who claimed to be a shield , who carried a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed Son ! &quot;
&quot; watching a live feed , where a polic@@ eman is standing in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ ish dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , escaped another pol@@ ishing is his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; rec@@ alled Fer@@ rel@@ l to her statement . &quot;
that is not the kind of murder that we have used to ourselves and which we can call typical .
at this moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went to the next day at home .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , in the cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter who carried a cau@@ lif@@ ter and a suitable crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember , as I have taught you , when black people have to fight for that , what they believe ? &quot; remembered what she said . &quot;
we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 year old boy and that was not correct .
&quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of its ... what happened in the past .
&quot; it is necessary to know it , and it must be seen and raised in it . &quot;
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck , to give her an experience in which they personally do not experience a qui@@ eter racism , it is not different from the next black women @-@ child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove to have a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Road , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was to a Camp@@ site , as the activists waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined together with a local commercial owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared pockets before and hal@@ ves to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to accept a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her comra@@ de Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l in the meaning : &quot; want to document , or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nourished by countless cases of people often by White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and res@@ ili@@ ence .
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices are not cent@@ red and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , which is known for his activ@@ ism in order to swing . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer to Fer@@ rel@@ l , along with six other locals , followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after browsing . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , for so I will be depicted . &quot;
&quot; the goal was to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a mes@@ si@@ der guide , but to a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life , as she fell in love and mar@@ ry her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability during this work and for the Menshevi@@ k of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black ow@@ ls women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ mor@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as sw@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions have borne the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and so we fight constantly on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women need to bear the main last of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to remark , that &quot; the movement is kept true of black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it consists of that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ess type of action , &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l has been selected because of their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the front front , because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long since disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ ade of a highway in a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that it calls her home : &apos; a chaos .
&quot; nevertheless , it turns into a chant and she feels committed to that memory , since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the street three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , although it is not yet built for a long time . &quot;
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ eastern part of the pedestrian zone , turned on the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation 2009 . &quot;
&quot; cold , the subject is hardly any one . &quot;
on our Facebook page &quot; Pop@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic will be discussed .
&quot; they say one to the bit &apos; gallery : &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; that would be real &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; would be real &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or quite plain : &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advocates are building that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , of which the rest of the business will benefit , the opponents are worried that then the pedestrian zone ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , in which the peasant market hall is available , in the 13 direct market @-@ market its products . &quot;
with the start of construction work will be the conclusion .
&quot; the Gallery @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - in addition to a Bed@@ a place , with possibility of sitting outside . &quot;
Simone rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farm hall for many years now .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land women are always very happy . &quot;
even the but@@ cher was discovered for us too .
&quot; we would like to hope that during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether there are a direct market in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of the rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the new project should probably not be low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; why shopping Palace in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; clothes , shoes , dru@@ d@@ - or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough of them in our city .
one can see how many charges are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; however , there is not even a regular weekly market , it &apos;s all the more important that at least get the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producers and is ob@@ struc@@ tive inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , Lad@@ in stores in a shopping center will only be reserved for larger companies , because the dor@@ ms are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , speci@@ als are there almost no longer and what still exists , will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a Mark@@ thalle does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmers market hall during construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming . &quot;
&quot; or creates the g@@ hosts bit previously , all the shops from Bit@@ burg to exp@@ el ? &quot;
George Mi@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farmers market hall it is thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ ous many - as I find - sensual construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place more .
&quot; when the peasant &apos;s market hall is sh@@ utt@@ led , a piece of culture will again disappear . &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ significant - that hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks and hair @-@ sec@@ tioning who were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning l@@ apped the cuts out of the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret services Analy@@ tics sent a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after it made publicly known as a secret diplomatic reports about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ bin ( A suitable similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline , their expertise in technology , computer science and arts , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ wife and pioneering dis@@ si@@ ed , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the sculp@@ tural analysis of DNA , which was created by M@@ anning and created out of the 30 portraits , like anyone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways , how they can be interpreted , and the in@@ dur@@ al determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations , but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already talked about the identification as a woman , was condemned in 2013 due to 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age@@ Act , or theft and theft . &quot;
&quot; in prison , her image was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which m@@ anning clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ blonde Per@@ gap - with which it was associated with it . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &quot; stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; in that , the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette lighter and chew@@ ing g@@ um by removing the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a magazine magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while they were in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press release of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time , and she could not be photographed , so she took contact with Chelsea , and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and its det@@ ain@@ ted m@@ use became un@@ equal spectac@@ les that inter@@ changeable in the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of the Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which would fores@@ een a future in which the President Chel@@ ore judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was published , cre@@ ing liberation after seven brutal years would demand in a military b@@ ulation in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome way of happy co@@ gni@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; there is also a little deeper and bar@@ gain since the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tru@@ mp leads to a war against inform@@ ants out of the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ eter , which he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery &apos;s written artistic statement called M@@ anning with its over@@ sized signature , including ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their sur@@ name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ als of Cs and GS , and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific dictionary ( artist ) to show how amazing similar , at least in biological ways , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring along , is that our gen@@ ome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
it shows m@@ anning as it appears with a free prec@@ arious position in the hand of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they put your speech , then they have won , says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who p@@ ours out of Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get ge@@ ek when I talk about it .
&quot; M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but when they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the midst of the room from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ mer , which coinci@@ des as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also target @-@ oriented , as everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , cre@@ ings St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human being , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted that it feels like a mass movement that de@@ formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also hidden behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of University of North@@ western and a director of Oxford University sought for killing
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which were sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .

&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University cooperates in this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ elles . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail declaration that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the U.S. investigation agencies in any way . &quot;
the statement added that waiting colleagues were sho@@ cked and want it to be .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , he said , he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have a presentation of their location , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building Administr@@ ative of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ Building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it is unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by safety cameras that La@@ ws and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the victim of offering and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada @-@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian Vice ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ doping agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ doping agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; at a given stage in fulfilling the criteria of the timetable , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ doping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap has been updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the timetable of the W@@ ada to comply with code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ establishment of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the Organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything to concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria stated in the list above , however , that the Russian anti @-@ doping authorities must accept the reported results issued by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to the nation@@ ally funded di@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; we lead the investigation by because our anti @-@ doping system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programmes , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Doping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales department R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ doping organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the deployment of D@@ op@@ ing@@ Contro@@ ls in Russia in November 2015 .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ doping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Director @-@ Direc@@ torate Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA has moved &quot; &quot; in the right direction &quot; &quot; to be used again . &quot;

Amy Deli@@ ver wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers do not mour@@ n to the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; &quot; said Deli@@ ver , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Reed . &quot;
it has brought people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to address surveys , specific groups and demo@@ graphic groups to address employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases Whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n permit , to handle C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools is used by companies to measure employee commitment . &quot;
&quot; salvation told us that they have better insight into what your employees think , and have won over the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that shows most of the complaints and which managers have low additions results - so that you can re@@ bo@@ unce why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture you have to stay , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , who have spoken a blog post , where those who have spoken have been pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business option .

&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and recognize , saw an ascending interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convertible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible companies can send custom &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with the staff to get bad behaviour .
&quot; and when the main business leaders is involved , complaints can go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded Reg@@ ulators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that its employees treated badly or beha@@ ves in@@ eth@@ ically , it can cost precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers and peti@@ tions , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , convertible more than a year , to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; once an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she wanted to submit a phone number or email to the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Conver@@ cent uses , problems , which were previously hidden by executives , who were previously identified in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ lau@@ er trainees faster and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can arrive closer to this holistic , 360 degree view into experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders on employment , legal disputes . &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and staff commitment in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media came to their right , &quot; that companies known that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ ters offer your software as a service , and loads the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors , which will have both start @-@ ups supported . &quot;
&quot; convertible received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire and T@@ ola Capital , which was lifted up the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; he secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s staff of their jobs are expected more than before . &quot;
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bet@@ s .
the staff want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be in a company that &apos;s their voices heard , and that the work you do is worth it , then , Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is used both convertible and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors can reach Ren@@ di@@ st if their portfolio companies are well running . businesses run well if employees work and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you can find support . &quot;
the data on employee commitment is important in the experts of the workplace culture .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a business do not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an anticip@@ ation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the changes does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can grow dis@@ appointments and co@@ ils . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to have to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company has seen too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , employees wonder , &quot; Hab@@ t you really heard me ? &quot;
do you take care of this ?
and whom do you not take care of why ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Reed , who passes through monthly surveys now has been able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so deliver@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated collaborators , it was able to re@@ organise and add various teams within the company through the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organizing multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to better ties of workers in a industry which is known for high revenues . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose human beings , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood @-@ ins
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise fields of the team are talking on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ bun@@ ks and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the workout .
for a good part of the team this incomplete minutes is a lunch break .
&quot; players who are written to the summer courses are returning to their audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ k mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 will start to meet the already packed time plans of the player . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood moved to the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game times in West@@ wood .
&quot; they are to be kept in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the formal exercise preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a further point to the multiple @-@ time routes of the player . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply put it through , they plac@@ ements themselves further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , what given the clear si@@ line of its fields from a adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that was already exposed to a door@@ bell , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent there a room and then adjust it there to record an exercise . &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and of an exercise it is a fairly good deal .
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not doing so much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify the facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterf@@ eit@@ ers to fac@@ tor@@ tion of third parties and display their results under the original fee , said the world &apos;s largest online social @-@ network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website that it will start with the use of updated machine methods , to recognize possible fal@@ cons and to send it to fac@@ tor@@ tion that may display results from the original article from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main points of events for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe they also have influenced the U.S. presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has become a major political issue in Europe whereby the French voters should be pun@@ ished in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan according to social media networks , if they do not succeed , h@@ ull @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany have launched a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding what stories of the fact @-@ tested parties are challenged , people want to meet more context in order to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to be his feature to &quot; &quot; test &quot; &quot; and works to other changes to his news Feed , to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he years a can@@ yon hole .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says w@@ ish@@ ful . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book by Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and , Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter , who was written by a double @-@ minded in the 1700 @-@ he years , he says for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his durability ! &quot;
&quot; and they cried to smoke , because at that time one led a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as if it would be . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I have been a little over four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest &quot; ) , this seems to be very nice to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to explore the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed hy@@ bri@@ ds on the walls and the bottles , the centuries in the dit@@ ch had spent . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with coun@@ ties , gar@@ dener , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 as the last one , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when joined a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive that he said than &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ok@@ rates said &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; Ta@@ ast@@ ray , letters from the time of English &apos;s emp@@ ires , cards , which constitute , &quot; you could think that country conflict would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar to have fought the two families . &quot;
guys , let everything go his course ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection will use the castle as a base to immerse on a wider base in the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant place of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a mo@@ il , which appeared 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly &apos; of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farmer began in this area and I thought , an insurrection was a good beginning . &quot;
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ ch@@ ers who gave the family Dar@@ rel@@ l seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is represented in the 18th century , who filled his own f@@ uneral by filling a coff@@ in with rocks ( a discovery that was only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be Ga@@ un@@ er to always make debts and spend money on things that they could not afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men redeemed their debt crisis by making rich old women married - I imagine it as a bunch of good guys before , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experience
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel on El@@ se@@ d@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the site of a san@@ itation in the early 20th century , which has since then returned from nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ n life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the sleeve of the 301 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef on Friday has started their campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; still until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff will want to keep the logo and the slogan for Nelson Ar@@ tz . &quot;
at the end of August it should be the highlight of the campaign a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on the poster at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really , write them on their yesterday un@@ folded website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
&quot; and to make it clear , that some is better than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we as Bad Honne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in the action there is more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a real promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able one . &quot;
finally they stand in competition with other municipalities .
an average five @-@ digit amount is the city of Bad Honnef its new roof brand and the campaign cost .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ sion@@ ing and ob@@ struc@@ tions in the officer officer .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
&quot; but nothing is routine under the Turkish armed forces , a year after the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; under the presidency of the Government now the five vice @-@ president , as well as the Minister of Defense , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the surplus . &quot;
the government moves to the bre@@ eder in the military .
&quot; General Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the comm@@ anders of the army , the air forces and the Navy were set . &quot;
&quot; since the failed cou@@ p has frozen Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile Mo@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erdo@@ gan as a wire drawing of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , which should immediately be involved in the coup attempt to be involved in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan the overthrow of God as a &quot; God @-@ gift , &quot; because he give him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan the army really under control ?
in the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet released an article entitled &quot; un@@ eas@@ iness in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff , there are concerns for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which among other things manifested themselves in the abolition of the cep@@ hal@@ ban for Sol@@ dat@@ inside , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the generosity of the army and security forces goes on at any rate .
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan by decre@@ e further 73@@ 95 citizen @-@ serving , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
thereby it seemed as Erdo@@ gan the military war@@ med .
the gener@@ als in earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times put@@ tie them under appeal to their role as gu@@ ardian of the world state .
&quot; after his election in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan the power of the military step by step back , not least by calling on reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan &apos;s driving targeted to the armed forces of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; warned a particular not permanent officers , who sought after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if this , such development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is no doubt in the alliance for the cleansing of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the management structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; it looks ahead , the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , more stringent regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill of law should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty reduction , wages and billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by changing the way the citizens from other countries of Green Cards will be spent . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new review procedure will come to the candidates who have English , who have financial resources to assist themselves and show knowledge that our economy will come to good , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to rehabilitation track for racing
&quot; again , over the past few months , over the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les had been progres@@ sed - it is now very easy to go . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , at the m@@ aro@@ w track , on which the tourist path is going to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing car in the long term , according to the transport of the Ministry , the Ministry of Education still will start on the track in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and re@@ plen@@ ish the track of Il@@ men@@ au race track , the country is committed to this especially for tourism important connection , &quot; stated Traffic &apos;s secretary Klaus Sü@@ ver on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the costs for the repairs carried out by the track rose to approximately 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the land is 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the treaty , based on the shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , I will currently finally be conclu@@ sively explained . &quot;
the ministry and the southern direction as the operator may be agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; in this way the roadmap , the used vehicles and quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said Sü@@ ver . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so that the racing cycle @-@ Shuttle on December 2017 can be ordered regular .
the speed@@ rope @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ sti@@ g .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation in the course of a pilot operation , the distance of sufficient many people was used to order them back in the future . &quot;
the route is also heavily ra@@ ined in parts .
the rise of sex robot is real and we should worry about
&quot; just as you thought it can not happen in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , in fact . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their climb seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen developed by their infl@@ atable partners to robot@@ ic with a silicone skin that feels warm - with aware of human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs &quot; &quot; and choose everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot to the type of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , because many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would look like a step@@ ford @-@ woman of progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone ret@@ ina .
&quot; the real B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to customize their robot to the properties which they find attractive , such as student . &quot;
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of pup@@ il and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible and war@@ ms the website of True Comp@@ ani@@ on .
&quot; so , you like what you like , and she does not like what you may not like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ divided female properties , the An@@ no@@ des on rape , if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( said here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , be@@ ati@@ zed one most . &quot;
on his website True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why do men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is called on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
their creation and increasing refinement indicate something dark@@ er and deeper into our culture to retreat from the ideal for gender equality towards a desire for sex with subj@@ ection as an optional enc@@ ore .
&quot; most men will of course have no sex robot , and while FR@@ R re@@ viewing its increasing popularity , they still remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ aks out of the edge zones , can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or animated until they give permission to the free market .
&quot; there is a certain abundance that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time where the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there has been a president in the White House who has s@@ led to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
the deter@@ rent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images that sle@@ w the swal@@ lowed body and the out@@ och@@ y eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robot is to make a physical similarity with actual women as realistic as possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want to make themselves human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot;
you can not separate yourself from their companion or simply walk away .
&quot; they do not have any mediation or a background history , nothing that might hin@@ ge on independence or anything that might distur@@ b the fantasy of total sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation . &quot;
different expressed : they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a bin@@ oc@@ ative of the Tru@@ mp era , that the political divisions that pol@@ arized US @-@ elec@@ torate , also have families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ ot , there were newspapers in the US newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s relative . &quot;
we are all alleged to put all of us in order to plat@@ former our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of tru@@ mp , families . &quot;
&quot; I mention this , because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ oriented poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; Tru@@ mp in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further connection that this will also bring significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the pro@@ vision@@ ing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ assy possibility that we can no longer cope with the kittens of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a yet long @-@ time scenario in the Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans of the Right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appears to its standards suddenly as in@@ lay of denial . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the mad@@ ness - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact , as a very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Re@@ public@@ ans must be only mental to qualify itself as an im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to Car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ ous@@ el of New York &apos;s car department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city , if no caffeine needs . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are k@@ on@@ ly@@ rig and the animals turn out to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate @-@ changing music gives this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many monasteries of a city disap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines will become familiar to offer much excitement and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five years later , and I am still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s years and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have been able to rate the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to match the rating with a 15 % tips - this , to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this leads not only to a slow@@ ing of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologies , while I tired the experience that made my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pi@@ stor@@ ius moved from prison to hospital
Pi@@ stor@@ ius has left prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of snor@@ ing on his w@@ rists that he suffered the prison authorities according to a fall in his cell .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius was condemned to an appeal of prosec@@ ut@@ ors for the murder of the Prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he öt@@ te ste@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by giving them several times through a door of the toil@@ et@@ kab@@ ine in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia on her .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for an noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der that hid in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pi@@ stor@@ ius App@@ ell , from which they say it is too short @-@ sigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the national prosecution authority said that they will raise the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
Pi@@ stor@@ ius runs danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the Vi@@ kl@@ äs@@ s@@ ler from F@@ sho@@ oters and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the continued schools . &quot;
three of the class@@ mates in the future go to Gymnasium ( Gymnasium ) four to the real school .
school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .

&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ n@@ erhof &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chicken . &quot;
instead of a chicken song came a little eagle .
&quot; however , the hope to make out of him a chicken , the eagle stretched out onto a high mountain up his wings and de@@ parts . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck , the cylinder bore to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , said Schul@@ director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonging to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wished every Vi@@ kl@@ ah@@ ler that he feels in his new school .
&quot; thanks for the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always starts again with negoti@@ ators , and the parents representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen @-@ time is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; they leave classes after two years of lessons , as it had been a really great time . &quot;
finally it was able to rely on the Vi@@ kl@@ ah@@ ler .
&quot; in conclusion , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
the children broke great joy with the children .
the new school year are already registered for eight first players .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprison@@ ed because of illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , a group of illegal refugees , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while there is currently an investigation . &quot;
the State Department reported b@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free camps and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , is not for this purpose . &quot;

software update for Diesel Cars : what affected people now need to know
how accurate is the software update instead ?
do Diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the emissions of emissions of the emissions classes euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an from ACE car Club Europe there are reviews :
is the new action compulsory ?
&quot; no , the controlled software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the obligatory updates before apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the driving force ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a fast implementation during the next few months , but still no exact date . &quot;
Daim@@ ler has communicated to write every person concerned .
&quot; if any inspection is required , it will be done within the frame . &quot;
how long should the change@@ over change altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an . &quot;
the depends on the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen voluntarily , the auto@@ oh@@ er@@ ers are not acting with the topic of the environment so far . &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the change@@ over itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming can be it to get an appointment .
&quot; what do mot@@ orists , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE reveals to wait .
&quot; probably , foreign manufacturers would re@@ undergo , so S@@ met@@ an . &quot;
is now a massive price @-@ case of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where the har@@ b@@ inger dro@@ w@@ ning . &quot;
there is so far no value loss for older diesel until now .
the ACE tra@@ ys with a sale yet to be seen .

we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ Champion , continues in R@@ ente next year . &quot;
the job is already written - suitable candidates are however ra@@ r .
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ akers .
and work is still great fun as he taught in the press interview .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we have no application for the application profile to date . &quot;
the city is searching for an architect or civil engineer at the next time .
in this way - having regard to the regular periods of notice - still enough time for a job .
&quot; since Has@@ lach was responsible for the administration of the community as a sub@@ committee , the applicant has to determine corresponding termin@@ ations . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they would not fill them any more , the citizens would have to travel to Offen@@ burg to Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but civil distance is the city and himself important , says W@@ acker that reported by a good working environment as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , to look back to the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , he is confident about the building of the building and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ arrangement of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the lower @-@ park @-@ park for example are met .
&quot; the chin @-@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the state @-@ rehabilitation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; this latter alone will make you be@@ ech around 1.5 million euros with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; if we &apos;re making it right &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my followers . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; gest@@ ed , be there for a city @-@ master big margin . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building and gar@@ dener can be flexibly re@@ acted to multiple .
&quot; you can move a lot &quot; , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the founders will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old city stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what pur@@ est fits , when re@@ constructions are approved , empha@@ sizes the ex@@ cre@@ denti@@ als . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ aker bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is belly , &quot; at the end everything goes through my table . &quot;
he can count on many years of support and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus New@@ maier ( high @-@ building ) has been for the past ten years as Manfred Scho@@ er ( low @-@ building ) has been for 15 years .
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; for continuity is not only important for a good business climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to inher@@ it at the city of Has@@ lach , a diploma @-@ engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree of expertise in the fields of building and building law , should have good expertise in the fields of building and construction . &quot;
&quot; under the municipal office , high @-@ and low @-@ construction , construction planning , gr@@ tre@@ wer@@ age matters , management of urban property , urban environment with Bau@@ hof and municipal authority , including monument protection , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle thrown on pi@@ pelines : southern route locked
&quot; according to the police previously unknown , the blue bike had thrown over from the railway station in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the cables . &quot;
these were so heavily damaged that the cur@@ sing quality of goods have to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male t@@ att@@ ters and look for the night hours after them .
near the scene we have been observed by witnesses a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ stre@@ ich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
the or the perpet@@ r@@ ator had brought himself into great danger and threat@@ ens the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the system as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail transport , we could also provide pin @-@ customers to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; in total , to go from a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic could be guided on the southern route without disability . &quot;
&quot; almost ten person@@ es were Friday morning , two of them regarded the remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; quality coatings did not fell , but they had delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 meters of upper lines .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , milk products and chocolate could help to rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammation rank@@ ings ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed intestinal diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects in the US some 1,@@ 3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach cr@@ ates and paraly@@ sis , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while sufferers may normally get out , meat and milk products ste@@ er to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found researchers at the Washing@@ toner University that contributes to the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins to contribute to promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immun@@ cells in the intest@@ ine said to make sure the harmful micro@@ bes , who hide in the food not intru@@ sion into the body . &quot;
cells that are capable of dis@@ integrate inflamm@@ ations are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues .
&quot; when the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result from infl@@ amed bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
in experiments was noted that a kind of tolerance of promoting immune cell is found in mice that contain a particular bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins to dis@@ solve the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one at Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ant , less infl@@ amed intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us promotes when the same system is also with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral studies in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when it found out that a group of study corporations had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe but had not been lod@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; they assumed that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ans of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the dam@@ me of the mice became DNA sequ@@ encing , and were found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they were missing a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om , and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria controlled on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i introduced in a liquid and then over@@ led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was cleans@@ ed , it proved to be an out@@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers hit the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cerv@@ antes Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in people like with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with infl@@ amed intestinal diseases . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially a high degree of dreams can lead to an expansion of these populations .
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ d@@ der evening his debut against Samp@@ it had . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday starts , and impres@@ ses in the holder of age , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after Beli@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; MA@@ TIC was however excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues , and made only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later ready to be .
besides M@@ atic start@@ ling also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent contained in this week , that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wish three additional liabilities , but he insi@@ sted that the club already made a &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; , &quot; three of his four priority new commitments to be fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , thank you for the club , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great difficulty . &quot;
&quot; Boeing &quot; &quot; Dream@@ liner &quot; &quot; in the sky &quot;
the U.S. plane Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers into the sky .
&quot; the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle to the US state Washington , but the drawing began in the U.S. state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo was painted in the sky .
new drau@@ ght for Martin Schulz - Hannover - we have a problem
&quot; just as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was the SPD leader , socialist @-@ democratic prime minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only no interference from the party , is merely no counter@@ wind out of the covenant - so that the most important desire of the electoral struggles . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has been fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees have been monitoring from the Willy Brandt House with growing the events in the SPD @-@ ruling state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not even be described in the approach . &quot;
there were deep stops .
and indeed one by one .
the federal state CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the board network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising question of a Green Party led the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) over@@ thrown into a serious crisis .
five months before the European elections lost its red @-@ green coalition with it its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ federal business leader Michael Kellner has prompted the Ab@@ tr@@ unc@@ ge Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ west to return their mandate .
the over@@ turn to the CD@@ U means a clear distor@@ tion of the voting .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return their mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal business leader and electoral campaigns of the Gre@@ ens Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not be true , &quot; &quot; sigh@@ s a SPD &apos;s electoral campaign , as on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ s reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green S El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U without separate governmental majority . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland elections in March .
&quot; a blue eye , no more , cal@@ med down the comrades . &quot;
according to the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
this was then too - and it was all much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ ite Haute the party smooth . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the comrades in the weeks afterwards turned back again . &quot;
&quot; then when they had just got a new courage , the G @-@ 20 top came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with it the next free@@ zing came .
&quot; Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last powerful SPD country estate , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend he sat in Als@@ ace , while his city burned . &quot;
and because he was doing so pretty much in crisis communication after that which one can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
&quot; because of the VW Ab@@ asi@@ an and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a longer time . &quot;
mi@@ dd@@ led re@@ frac@@ tures have arrived .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely , W@@ eil tried to put stronger in the Bund over the past weeks . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former civil war of Hannover , his power in Berlin stayed in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him give it as they spoke by W@@ eil a stabili@@ zation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; by doing so , W@@ eil meets the im@@ partial internal compul@@ sion of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in fact no fault . &quot;
and Schulz does not at all .
&quot; sometimes , the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger depends on the Gre@@ ens , and here mainly on the desc@@ endant female parliam@@ ent@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , like Ms T@@ ests provides their own care@@ ers on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the convention in the SPD @-@ Bundestag ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ ests has not been elected by its person as a director , but on the national list of Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische MEP . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ Bundestag , lam@@ ents an &quot; &quot; non @-@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vote of four years ago was clear : people made Stephan W@@ eil made by the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische SPD as a pioneer in the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career of a future CD@@ U MEPs said the W@@ ah@@ ler result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called to clear the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
sponsors of the Centre III
&quot; who wants to use the hotel in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative tri@@ ght city development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler had even had a review of the previous one .
since 1991 it has been received in delicate renovation areas .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
the grant was at least 60 percent in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 .
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it was finally important to promote the internal development , not only new construction areas . &quot;
on 4 April one will receive the information from the Karlsruhe Institute in Karlsruhe that there will be a san@@ itation area III .
&quot; the con@@ veying sum amount 8@@ 33 333 Euros , thereof 2 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church . &quot;
how is a refurb@@ ishment ?
&quot; one will continue to examine as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; truly old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned field in general interest . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional representative could be moved once again . &quot;
&quot; the prot@@ ector at the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ re Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal states &apos; social programme &quot; &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of interior cities , improving living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would object to object , that is , done per plot . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment area would eventually be determined as a statute .
the payment period for the funding period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
&quot; however until September this year , however , the inventory of this year would be carried out only once a questionnaire to fill out the questionnaire on the refurb@@ ishment area . &quot;
&quot; in November or December the statutes will be possible , so that the renov@@ ations can be started in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then stated that any Commune , that any Commune have been able to carry out investigations . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore to evaluate the urban planning , and decide when re@@ moves , and to what extent . &quot;
for the particular property there will be also a re@@ assurance in the basic book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come again , and get an impression of the situation , she said . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of those involved . &quot;
&quot; therefore , questionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and ground@@ work bow &quot; &quot; with which it is among other things about the building state and re@@ development prospects . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; data can be made on size , distribution and residents of a residential area . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; bow &quot; &quot; is only possible if in the building business rooms are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , please note that Got@@ zel pointed out that a filling out questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ able . &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of the con@@ veying means after the &quot; wind @-@ union &quot; functional - who first comes , ex@@ hor@@ ted first . &quot;
you can &apos;t reserve a sponsor for later . &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British inventor itself sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door , enter his office and even can start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny Chip between thum@@ b and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consultant An@@ a@@ an@@ esi@@ sts at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together to ensure that the impl@@ ant method is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr North@@ am wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything at a surcharge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
the married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which starts when his hand is on the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event which highlights the American production last month , costs tax pay@@ ers according to the data of the military that have been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ k@@ lift from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter flight in an frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn landed , after the record of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of because there is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty nav@@ al commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicop@@ ters arrived at the South La@@ wn on 17 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 : 00 , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that , in case of departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the hours a second team needed for the return flight . &quot;
the original flight was during the event during the helicopter while the safety of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
&quot; from the records provided in the TI@@ ME , it was not clear if ultimately a second flight time needed was necessary . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state @-@ placed property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could inj@@ ure the destination .
&quot; a question which we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; said the dep@@ uty commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a impetus for the reform of health reform , which was going on in the Senate , and he pro@@ vised the efforts to da@@ w@@ ning the government regulations . &quot;
making use of the plane that is known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
Presidents are obligated to use them for travel .
&quot; but their use only for a photo operation , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries will show , which are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Minister of White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training excursions in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn , to reset the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters . &quot;
&quot; as the Tru@@ mp beginning of July at the G@@ 20 top in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was introduced in the White House of 58 practice . &quot;
&quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event mat@@ tered for the training needs of the flight for the month , said an official . &quot;
helicopter units also flew 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential commis@@ sions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers have no burden for any of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; one speaker from Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in providing the helicopter to the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not stop the budget for the presidential excursions , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ari@@ tion of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D collection for the v@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight per hour . &quot;
records of the unit record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of the estimates for the amount of equipment is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a margin from the year 2015 the revenues of DO@@ D contain not included personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former pres@@ ses@@ cher of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ are , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ are . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state is very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I am assum@@ ing that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight the highlight . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear if Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s residence . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp said to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ vice with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; especially on the back positions , I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V ensure the imports from the high north .
&quot; their plans and fin@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay overlooking Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ culp@@ ture and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , as well as Andreas Bj@@ s@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this will become as always hard for us .
you also need a good serving luck . &quot;
the ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip in the high north is practical .

how America can harm the US
&quot; truly happy , Donald Tru@@ mp not , when he put Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ re his signature among the law on the sharpen@@ ing of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in its h@@ ast , the law en@@ acted &quot; , &quot; the Congress gave a few &quot; &quot; constitu@@ tionally &quot; &quot; provisions . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sm@@ elled against the US hegemon@@ y . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft is to pun@@ ish European companies that help Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of domestic O@@ MV are , in common with other European companies , which are co @-@ financed by other European companies in the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea area . &quot;
the dron@@ es is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , as the official statement of the oil group . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to ar@@ ouse the sanctions even as an executive order to life . &quot;
twelve arms are available to him .

position back@@ wards : the town presents 46 kitchen
the city organ@@ ises the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock is turned back .
&quot; on September 1 , the town of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal children &apos;s daily facilities ( Kit@@ ā@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Vice @-@ director in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we all have been very pleased . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , besides house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the city runs in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care sites , in 44 the children take for lunch time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; over the past Kit@@ a@@ Year , 2@@ 800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , which are taken care of 45 hours of weekend , in the K@@ ita &apos;s lunch &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour support when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 participants from the 1st September kitchen service : you warm up the landscap@@ ed meals , add them to the salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioned the meal individual , give the food out , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a ger@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are groups as well as seven@@ ties - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ per now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; thus they are much more involved , and it is easier to put into practice pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen strength to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the ger@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will be settled in the future of special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm , which it turned out to the cost between self @-@ reg@@ aining and stran@@ ger for the city as the most economical , it is called the press ministry . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces can be re @-@ employed . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at all 750 people in the gu@@ ardians , not so strongly in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , the UN says . &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UNO @-@ Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ es , official Head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are can@@ als in the provinces of the provinces . three women are can@@ als for the role of the Vice President and over 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can be only really representative and credible when women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the choice process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5 .
the Taliban have released threats against a choice process that coinci@@ de with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time passed the power of peace from a democratically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ es said , a strong role for women will still increase the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; the Afgh@@ an independent electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of registered 3,@@ 6 million voters . &quot;

GM@@ B concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to make a trade union with the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to the production in their work in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company spoke about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory next to other products plan@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds over the past few years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives are &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; , &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Fili@@ al@@ leiter of the company called GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s , to express &quot; concerns that financing for the modernisation of production lines will not be driven . &quot;
&quot; GM@@ B @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce focus strongly on the local community and the Grand Prix , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ xit , the rising life cost and the chronic production of production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross first received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland , and the company will react directly to it , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had a regular meetings with staff and GM@@ B representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross , during which some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we operate as all companies who work in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business are constantly checked - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility , and all of them . should our operating processes change at the site , the staff and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La League likes your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Saint @-@ Germain will not be reported in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after they released an offer of £ 189 million in order to dis@@ solve its free@@ wheel rings , but they warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the world summit ? &quot;
&quot; sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the World Record to break more than double the previous brand , with Paul Sz@@ ba came back in the last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athl@@ ete in the world . PS@@ G provides wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside , although a source is near the Catal@@ ans board , that the club always has his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of him . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president prior to this view ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in a sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have passed this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ Mittel@@ feld Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow it to leave the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by having lost one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report dem@@ reli@@ eved Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report to the abuse of the abuse of the Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report for the abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ sing , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after the publication of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur , he anticipated by the former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Bene@@ dict Bene@@ dict XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve to the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret on their own sub@@ stitutes , or their then false evaluation of the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; in contrast , critic@@ ised that in reporting on violence in the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; two measure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the transi@@ tions in Regensburg no one doubt that it must be pun@@ ished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al Mani@@ p@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; thus the &quot; degree of medi@@ al Mani@@ p@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; thus the &quot; degree of medi@@ al Mani@@ p@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; such as the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; &quot; says the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; the histor@@ i@@ ker@@ k and a member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ic Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit that design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal for normal &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; &quot; you would like to go on the church and this is a frozen fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; beats a quite normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; to be with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they are unfair to use today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
in connection with reports about the abuse of abuse often also Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often applied .
&quot; fully w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly , author and historians Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who was translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder band &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with enligh@@ tening attorney to Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 domain spar@@ rows sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , this means that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms physical and psych@@ ic violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially in high E@@ motional ality , the punishment of the students could also remain fierce . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to many other accused , many victims were estimated by R. R. , and therefore in many cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview H@@ es@@ emann , why the final report for the abuse sc@@ andal against the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved in his opinion . &quot;
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; Pre@@ cas@@ u@@ alties of violence against the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; as a result , many students stand up his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who was tangible , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you read the effort and read all of the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one must be wondering why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all in it . &quot;
he is just dedicated to eight sides and he will clearly be acqu@@ itted from any susp@@ ici@@ on of medi@@ ate or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
&quot; also , the non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school occurred outside its presence . &quot;
you can pre @-@ throw him if too late or have taken first orders not seriously enough .
&quot; the Dom@@ pointed @-@ Sec@@ ond@@ ary School , on which he worked , was received by virtually all respon@@ dents than - &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the broad majority of his pup@@ il Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes him an excellent record , describes it as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; prof@@ ici@@ ently , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; and &quot; understand@@ ably &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; and &quot; understand@@ ably &quot; , &quot; &quot; prof@@ essed with cakes , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always enc@@ amped by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high adul@@ ter@@ ality , which also led to wo@@ ut@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only sk@@ inn@@ ed with chairs and cast out the key b@@ lows on the ground , but also ear @-@ hear@@ ted and too fre@@ er guys over the hair or ears , he has already existed for years ago , deeply de@@ plor@@ es and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; however , to his honor of salvation must however be said that such gu@@ ardians were widespread in the fra@@ gment time , the 1960s , and 1970s , were widespread in parents like in teachers . &quot;
do you also know such bre@@ eder methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and non@@ violence at the pre @-@ school , are the free Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; you ask yourself whether it is not likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as the brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ V@@ I. , that many media is straight on him . &quot;
&quot; on the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him still , still eag@@ erly . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eved Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in connection with the report , the report was very much reported about the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report as well as some complic@@ ation or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no single of the 67 victims of sexual transi@@ tions claims to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dre@@ amed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a sad@@ ness assistant for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the true issue in the education of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent .
&quot; if they don &apos;t even trusted parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ us leader who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ r@@ ator . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen pup@@ il Ro@@ cks &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a respon@@ dent student form@@ ulate it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... not the case in which he would have had such results ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely knowledge and could have the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that in him ... Bu@@ ying an urgent or cle@@ arer or even more likely to have opened as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ led , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear outcome : &quot; &quot; that the students involved in the advance of the students , and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the study . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to address any other hand . &quot;
&quot; thus , he cannot be pre @-@ thrown , not preventing or put it on display . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to connect its good name to these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it was unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; &quot; with the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is disc@@ ar@@ ded in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage it was mixed and mixed up into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the midst of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what is in turn the abuse of the report .
&quot; namely , there will be clean ; between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asium of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals with occur@@ ren@@ ces from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a chor@@ us of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which l@@ ad of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ gated teachers were inter@@ cep@@ ted and disp@@ uted , and among them det@@ ained , all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have rules . &quot;
&quot; but with those had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boy only to face when she had already been on the Dom@@ ar Sec@@ ond@@ ary School . &quot;
&quot; on this was , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the theme of &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &apos; paradise .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ itz School ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was already discipline , but there was no sa@@ vi@@ cious violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; many victims en@@ gen@@ dered the general humanity of R. R. , and therefore , in many cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; thus , most still remains the accus@@ ation to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods , in which he was reported by the states on the pres@@ ch@@ schule . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was not responsible for the events at a school where he didn &apos;t want to hear and be responsible ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
Dis@@ closure Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ itz v@@ asi@@ ums , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he shows that , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
already in view of the risk of negative media channels he recommended urgent intru@@ sion .
&quot; of course , this was at a time when legal clarity existed , as a check @-@ in was also recently banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they recorded in a legal gray area , like everyone of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was hard to estimate for him where the persons affected might be exagger@@ ated , or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible border had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can also not say , he always had a look . &quot;
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the test of schools were officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis asser@@ ted , it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards on the then period . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we historians talk there from the &quot; pit@@ falls of the An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger , the present day according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
since the inter@@ c@@ ession has already been right .
&quot; but this does not of course apply to sexual abuse who was ab@@ om@@ able at all times , and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of reflection and violence in un@@ trained children &apos;s sec@@ ts , which goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally working .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus ear@@ ching and to pull in hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment is then forbidden , he has also kept strictly in it . &quot;
what image of his Regen@@ s@@ burger Time has given Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in discussions with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
did the subject check in the language also in the language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells of his perspective , that the cathedral @-@ cats played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I didn &apos;t mean that he led a stric@@ ter regim@@ ent there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once again : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible to form a institution of Wel@@ fare , true cultural message of Europe and its musical tradition , which went to the USA twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone you do not make a big singer and stand before every success , in which area , however , discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work of the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and over again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , ground@@ ed , deep @-@ believers and sav@@ vy people , of which one could not imagine that he could only do a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get along with , like many former cathedral @-@ cats still today , 23 years after his em@@ ul@@ ing , regularly contact him , visit him , he is almost blind and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those that were not for@@ given to him today , so that he was once strict to them , so are clearly at the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect for respect to which they still have a look and to worship them . &quot;
&quot; and please , again , quite clear : all that one throws with him are gu@@ ardians , which were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long ago been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just one man , just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make for the medi@@ al sin@@ ful sin . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention that is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eved him . &quot;
&quot; now the rank @-@ areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bay@@ erns and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen finally in peace . &quot;
