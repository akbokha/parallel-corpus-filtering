<seg id="3">A sepulous chapel, where now for the S-Bahn tunnel is buried. "</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the most profound cause of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It doesn't matter if land cards are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everyone who had to exciting, because the car-Navi instead took place in a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical map of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bayern of the State Government, is anything but up-to-date - but is very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online-cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then, how many cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Münchner Mercury has changed since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a splattered canvas that one cannot recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture postcard we were involved in cities and churches with detailed maps, so-called vopositional sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These emerged according to the Bayerische StaatsMessinian administration between 1810 and 1864 and kidnapped the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader were occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wants an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if French troops served with the peace of Lunéville, from 9th February 1801, it was the present neighbours that created the idea of an area of Bavaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische Staatsmeasurer."</seg>
<seg id="19">The judgment sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische LandesLibrary.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of fruits / Today is most impressive at the example of the provincial capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears in the map of 1856 yet relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was built 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a district of Munich."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses undertook care of 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße which was named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: at the first glance: in writing a small disadvantaged card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten characters from the so called" "urine", "derived from which the basic tax is derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots do not occupy farmers today - but small gardeners of the plant "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 Carnival of the October Revolution, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the jungle sheet, one reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only reads the road names" "at the Gasteig" or from the hill "On the liar," but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the AuerField Street one once used people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there, 1858 / 59 was the Münchner district-Irrenanstalt" On the Auer Lüeventh. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden the institution - that Psychiatrist, who is brought to the death of King Ludwigs II in connection with the death of King Ludwigs."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was most advanced for his time, and for example, the Ankets of so called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"moreover, he is forbidden to use the personnel to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had been first place, later it was expanded to 500 seats."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point these capacity did not look any more - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the biggest psychiatrists in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">The area of the former Auer Anstalt is now meeting young people in Münchner Salesians.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order received the building complex 1920, and walked in a youth home with educational establishments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"west lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children of" Casa Don Bosco "" set up the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural reference to the country of origin of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War. "</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was founded around 1856 as" "main square", "the Kaufingerstrasse was named" "Kaufinger alley." "</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought in the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a tomb chapel dating from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days took the curtains and take place on 5 April 2017 of the spade line for the second S-Bahn platform."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>

<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Contemporary Art has issued a warning for coloured people which are on the basis of discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Missouri, which is intended to come into force by 28 August 2017, by bringing special attention to the state through the state, because a number of fragmentary, hard-based incident occur in recent times throughout the state and be listed here," "it says in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to win discrimination against minorities, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, the disproportionately to minorities, prompted the group to recover the voyage, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, the people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are assembled or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited as racist pletion against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under fragile circumstances beginning of the year, after he had no more petrol during the trip and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Directorate-owned by Missouri, in which it is shown that black motorists in the state is 75 percent more common than White."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready whether there are chewing money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri presented 100 hate-hate in 2015 according to the latest figures from the hate-breaking reporting program of the FBI that characterize the state regarding the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"the journey is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to shorten a company because of living or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberation Union (ACLU) had issued travel orders for Texas and Arizona, after the United Nations Credentials adopted, the local prosecution authorities to commit people to emigration according to the opinion of ACLU for further reprofiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel orders are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have employed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Consecrated project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishery Weideenchn project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the rectangle of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the fishery CDU-local Association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann offers first insights into its operation, in which it combines 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk and also houses many young animals and houses in five apartments holiday guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "black milk" "is for him the ageing marketer for the milk of its cows, so pierdemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests only comes regionally.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV-Chairman of fisheries bach, he called the" "elementary project". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not succeed in such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work; much need to be edited with the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elteral operation and pasted these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not perform bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the significance of the course of women and is glad to support the Leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers must be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"one hope that the surface of the surface could still be moved out for a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure that we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thinking about how they continue to work their business," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism due to the promotion often</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open space is about 40 hectares, which are not allowed until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of it was supported by Leader, a district carried by the Municipality of fisherbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers have had 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "explained Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac said," You are doing a really good job, without farmers and land wives. "</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White was fixed: "here best food products are produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape of SHR-Württemberg (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state promotion of ordination of ordination.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR-named conveyors.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the inconclusive area may not be towed (hattacking over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fishing course of the fishing project 2018 it is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which are building under 16 kilometers of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open space corresponds to 35 hectares, the cold costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the painfully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did, when he did a symbolic dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the President for the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller handle not the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jetowners and liberty-imitators had taken him out if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base has been added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta:" "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to which later was added and not part of the original statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is correct properly, but as he formulate it, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the upright words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" yours fatigue, your arms, / your oppressive masses that longing for, free to breath, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "miserable drop" on our screens better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller is not committed to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus and her friends, who put themselves in place their words on the basis of their death on the base - knew very well that they are a high political act."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American publicanism by presenting the feminine embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has got a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the link with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus the significance of the statue changed, the people from the right wing wanted to change it long."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big letter when Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty does not load, but rather an early neo-conservative, which is the American flame refilled into the world:" "Lady Liberty goes."</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Pretty unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and at all a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in them to see how they were seen by the exhaustive, but hopefully people after long and often terrible trips to the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump do ever want to recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black hole members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle reminds itself of a time when only two ballots belonged to the team of Great Britain.</seg>

<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland has developed something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue to proceed until we find it," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals of medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eiliie Doyle was elected by the team for the team members."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain speech was amazing," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and genuine feeling, the Eiliie completely naturally came, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal, which is present at their fifth world Championships at the 400-m-hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 kills are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes on the world championship was seven that were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The centerunners Muir leads on this road and took up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m is another snotte, which one was observed after a great season, who was able to watch the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminds itself of her first world Championships as the only other gravel in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain's captain tells that they are "enormously proud of the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team but in some cases also in medals and in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about being to be a team captain in it is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was anyway a great honour, but knowing that my team-mate has voted for me and have chosen me to make it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all those who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are established here as established athletes, athletes, who want to rise to Podium."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I just noted that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: do not block any public office if you cannot tolerate the income of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long before the newspapers smote him because of everything, from internal policies to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he slipped in criticism, safe."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics at silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in the year 1783 Washington said," "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we shall be slaughing like sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Governors Larry Hogan, who must work on it to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hock employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil War said it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the stick of the Governor leaves the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" "Na, and?". ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like manganese.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two highest approval of the 50 Governor of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary tool to connect with its constituents and to debate his haunless head after chemotherapy on his site.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of persons who come to the side of the Governors - that is a public forum that is considered officially and managed by staff who are to be paid with public taxes - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defending Hock Spreader in Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolles or spammers or hull people, which fluctuate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders, a teacher, a entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful, and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appeal to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyers at Lakshmi Sarani Ramani by Bowie, Md., was not hull filled, but she asked for hate-hate."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news," wrote them in the commentary section of the sending "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then they are regarded by some more rather than a so-called collective action and not as a large group of affected people."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governors presented as" "concentrated spam-attack," others would probably call "" intercession "." "</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking an critics or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner when in former times when you have done the same that staff have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines and to burn protesters, and to make silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what happened just digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">"Hogan is not the first public officers, which is criticized for it, that he has a Facebook and other social media."</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is filed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the president of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County is the first Amendment, according to the U.S. District Apostle James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she has a voters from its Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky governor Matt Bein (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mailbox on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyms like" "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius", "wrote all letters of newspapers that Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"misections, which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and navigation with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have them sweat.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of expression and discourses belong to the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories."</seg>

<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized by a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something, that was comparable to my price."</seg>
<seg id="1322">"this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made a quote on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square miles has been fully overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a welded layout - you had to go through the kitchen to go into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"this was my request," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she ordered the architecture and designer Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill that 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms to place one another, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative thinking to solve the default.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," "he explains."</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were overthrown, without having to bbing ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to lay the steel so that he had the right height above or down."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement could place Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic clutch window of Retrouvius looks over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold-furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both Enden is mirrored a short corridor to make him longer work.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feel like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance is mirrored units space for all hedge and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamourable space, the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went out there," "explains Erfan of the reinforced, veneer MDF door."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is essential so that when you push the door high, very easily gheads."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and a calculation based on the ground-size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they managed to enlarge the floor space and to use the same time high quality materials, which gives the space to its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not lose yourself in the electric power plugs in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"it shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design, and increased square meters of something standards into something completely different."</seg>

<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be the same for Paul as issues.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the distributions proposed by Colin proposed him with the left, which I kept for the best objects, he wrote in 2015 in a first monkey avit."</seg>

<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their attorneys.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin answered by SMS to say" I really cannot say much, "because the case is in front of the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very sad, very sad that my brother Paul decided to disguise me and draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote in writing to the Court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Stabschef plans to limit the media-abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new rod of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss at a more evenly course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new staff of the White House, on his first working day with leading staff, he asked a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wants to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tore Trump by supervise his media."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship with television dates decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was annoyed because of an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince him," said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that" the key to hold Trumps Twitter-habit among control, according to six former election officials in it, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Trumps Twitter-habit ever" under control "was ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these struggle of campaign don't know something we hadn't know - that Trumps Tweets had even more ignition to contain more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">"we will probably never learn anything about the tiets, the Trump has not sent."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff made it some times to hold it away from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"but no one has to prevent it consistently, that Trump checker calls forth."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem lies in finding that people in a white house, which brings up from competing parties, always try to move their own agenda by promoting Trump Material, which may potentially support their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - very busy with this history - told in May about the preference of consultants, the President of strategic reasons, beyond doubt."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example which was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump beamer said that Trump can respond to negative press cuts, especially those with corrupt leaks and that it derives out how these originate."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February, when someone called the president malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocation. Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy staff of Katie Walsh," "the source behind a pile to be of leaks" in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he voke the false accusations in the past and voke it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then pole Stabef Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage the paperwork and document the Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and its consultants are still looking for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof, by the then ambience operating company mbH and 13 April 2014, approximately 30 000 nights went lost per year and also revenues from the city tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in autumn 2014, in view of dramatically rising the numbers of refugees who were in the district, the hotel building served as a collective accommodation, provided for controversy over controversy."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented accommodation of asylum seekers through the setting of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but above all Freudenstadts Lieutenant Julian Osswald defended the hotel location, and spoke back then by more serious prospective buyers to the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should reserve the right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The Luisenhausen with chairmen of Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a lovely place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the black style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk showers, the entrance area is converted, new windows are built."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything was later" "beautiful bourgeois", "as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>

<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"you do not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a upscale downtown level, emphasizes."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affaires: us Special Jury sets the Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia-Affaires to U.S. President Donald Trump, special winner of Robert Mueller is supposed to have a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the panel was included in the work in the past weeks, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "with appeal to the subject of familiar persons."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper examines the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified its investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the CNN broadcasts, it already reported the first invitations of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services accused the Kremlin since longer to have been targeted in the presidential struggle in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">"Mueller studied, whether there was a distinction between Trumps Electives team and Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of investigations, several men should stand in the election campaign as consultants of the republicers."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to report, Mueller got more and more Trumps private and business environment under the magnifier."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" Washington Post "wrote a few weeks ago that the Trump Trump was personally moved to the center and seek the accusation under whether the president may hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Lawys is to prove this evidence in possible waste cases and decide whether the indictment is to be raised.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called Ankhing chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"mostly, they are switched on when it concerns larger and controversy cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be switched from the prosecutor to recharge persons with pus.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN Sender, the invitations were already exhibited, which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">People involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"besides Trump jr. also Trumps advisors and son-son Jared Kushner, as well as his damaliger electoral manager Paul Manafort continued by talking."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"right wing extremism said on Thursday night in the US television, that the composition shows that Mueller won't be intimidated in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the replacement of the Gremium was the beginning of a new phase in the studies and a new reason to concern president Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday night took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the subject will give the Democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else about whom they can talk."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special consultant Ty Cobb stated in an opinion, he tells nothing of the replacement of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this also usually work in secret, stressing."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House feared all measures that accelerated the work of the special-party in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI Chief James Comey made three times that I will not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"you have no reason to accept that something changed, it was in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">"Mueller was first used, after Trump Comey had been frozen."</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rooting, accusations against Trump were loudly, he wants to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump was asked for an adjustment of investigations against the former national security advisor Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure due to the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to the presentation of US media, the White House gathered the White House against the special press and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The soldering speculation about it whether Trump Mueller wants to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special rank of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later returned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which it theoretically could be folded to the president of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to bend such a step but prevention.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic Senators presented on Thursday's refusal in which the special erers could no longer be released so easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic ice cream drives in the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Westantarctic has solved itself a gigantic iceberg of the close size of Berlin from Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Oceanic Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the large colosum heavy and 5800 square kilometers large collobe now moved to the north and probably will need two, three years until he was melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"it is recorded with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ice rust, which researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"what extent the climate change has played a role in the breakage of ice, is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual clashes of ice shes in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colon has so far been a part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floating on the sea and is fed by great glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">So it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this sweep was the balance of wax and abrupt a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete Schelfeis was there to be broken, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is quite a lot that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice-plate is available in voltage and can be broken, if at a keypoint one piece."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg increases the sea level, because they float on the water and pushes ice so much water as it arises after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the sweep leads to that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only in low dimensions, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctica (MIDAS)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is after AWI-indications with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the vical fielfeis of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"in the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge of the open ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it will be regularly off.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and is not aware of direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now into a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most widespread withdrawal from the beginning of the record," confirmed also. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists he disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis now going to grow again or in the long run, and possibly merge together, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But these developments will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers did not withdraw the departure of this gigantic iceberg, in recent decades, there have been a lot of ice shelves of the Antarctic peninsula in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long finish of the Antarctica covers the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the polar surface of the Antarctic peninsula has declined since the 1950s at 28 000 square kilometers."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline has contributed to the decline in temperature.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The employees of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet with their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state Zaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">"it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children to the office, who were in 2009 the target of an attack with granulates, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they kindly ask the reporter, name for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug regulators, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals, which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest on the violence, and throughout the country the corpses have gone: at least 25, since president Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are standing by attacks and threats, and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, their editor and their inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence will be deeply received, although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows its Middle-finger with the word" Justice "," s Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, T-shirts, who present his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut. "</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 was established by a Sonder-federal government in order to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the committee on the protection of journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of killings that are associated with drug dealers and organised crime, the murderers of journalists will only be judged on trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoce they still exist still to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untrine, and although the terrain is now still traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very foolish to squander my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we suspect all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with" "twelve flow". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove out in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest in the past year and the delivery in the United States in January was Zaloa to become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rivals are struggling to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of discounted, two-storey mausoleen for drug royal, which are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have expedied the sons, suspected gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault lay in it, Valdez did not force them, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country into his own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived his friends and colleagues so long that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he was active as a senior reporter for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues on the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without bang on the rudote problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of the brave and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it, hard-to publish tests without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories, which nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce they received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, where ever they led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave us voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," "he said at the time of CPJ."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug stores in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must assume the task that falls you as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what did you do in view of so many tactics... why did you not say what happened before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was like a port workers, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher, who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guaynabo, the bar opposite the office, and there are always sitting at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now, ask them: was his love for the routine of his heir?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to ask their own assumptions in question how they can best do their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret grid - and cross-railways" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">To trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are not considered in Sinaloa - just as did in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where an toxic mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt."</seg>

<seg id="1871">Outside searched two policemen protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-story area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the Scherz, some of the reporter inquired about, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen which the governor himself did not be trusted."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drugs ties are under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has caught on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exit to the government spending, focused on the hometown of the Governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the office, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who has been kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows, that the restaurant is a favorite venue by drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter was made from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which was almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several pri-Governors were accused of high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal bat asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this eatery, including a son of" El Chapo "Guzman a military overfall."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before had the reader had seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the most informed source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "" because of its slim body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez became a storage space for signs and stickers, which are dedicated against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something that they themselves had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"Miriam Criam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning, because of another journalist at the office of the office."</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is."</seg>

<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is away from Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa, on the day after the assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez accused of authorities, journalists, and let them move, because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has asked since then that she is re-divided by the government, because she is worried that her anger has violated its objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico from organised crime, involved with government ministers and a simultaneous society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco journalist" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security forces, with organised crime under a ceiling. "</seg>
<seg id="1896">"the" "Articulo 19" "was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year."</seg>

<seg id="1898">Obviously the Morde have a deterrent effect.</seg>

<seg id="1935">"if you just blinded a little with eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the captain Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrackl Museum where the creature is seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies, the mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this crop is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably from meat eaters dinosaurs was threatened."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage, to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology that is known as a backlatment that is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to mix themselves better in its surroundings and to soften its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>

<seg id="1944">"although the contactment is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is far from far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted from sufficient pressure by meat, frescos dinosaurs, that evolution was favored the wear of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, who use the concredence - think of deer, zebras and pumpy animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which was signaled that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carnivory behavior on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs-beasts have had been to have been", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the dinosaurs was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal in evidence of his life, including his contour fourth, to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs died, when he died, moved into a river and turned into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>

<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with contested skin, but also in three dimensions remains intact and the original form of the animal retains," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early sounds.</seg>

<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, the one sat in St. Louis on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which rented it, and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">You stumbled across a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18 year old child, and it still lies on the road," "it was there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as no one else had on their feed the information posted, she closed Facebook and opened on Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly worshipped on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper in the territory of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mon."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He postete a picture of Brownering body that was stretched on the street and stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"it is wild," thought Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets through people on the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and people, the shouted, and of a man who claimed to be a shield, who carried a sign with the wording:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed Son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">"watching a live feed, where a policeman is standing in front of a group of protesters with a bellish dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, escaped another polishing is his rifle and cried," I will kill you... animals all kill you. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," recalled Ferrell to her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">That is not the kind of murder that we have used to ourselves and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a flight back and went to the next day at home.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? ", in the cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter who carried a caulifter and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember, as I have taught you, when black people have to fight for that, what they believe?" remembered what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police have killed a 18 year old boy and that was not correct.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them away," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of its... what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"it is necessary to know it, and it must be seen and raised in it."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck, to give her an experience in which they personally do not experience a quieter racism, it is not different from the next black women-child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove to have a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson Road, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was to a Campsite, as the activists waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local commercial owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halves to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new kind of activism for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August, she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her comrade Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell in the meaning:" want to document, or try to find a story that you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people often by White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices are not centred and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area, which is known for his activism in order to swing."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer to Ferrell, along with six other locals, followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after browsing."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, for so I will be depicted."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not a messider guide, but to a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life, as she fell in love and marry her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability during this work and for the Menshevik of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black owls women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killings of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" "BlackmorvesMatter" "in social media, identify themselves as swul."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in managerial positions have borne the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and so we fight constantly on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women need to bear the main last of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to remark, that" the movement is kept true of black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it consists of that" this is not a affirmess type of action, "where Ferrell has been selected because of their identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although it was at the front front, because with a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson has long since disappeared, but the racist connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is for 2 ½ years due to the blockade of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that it calls her home: 'a chaos.</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, it turns into a chant and she feels committed to that memory, since she went to Ferguson the street three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size wahn": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, although it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south-eastern part of the pedestrian zone, turned on the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation 2009."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject is hardly any one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Popfreund Bitburg" the topic will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"they say one to the bit 'gallery:" "this would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" "that would be real" "(Anja Becker) or" "would be real" "(Anja Becker) or quite plain:" "size wahn!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates are building that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, of which the rest of the business will benefit, the opponents are worried that then the pedestrian zone bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, in which the peasant market hall is available, in the 13 direct market-market its products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work will be the conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Gallery-Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - in addition to a Beda place, with possibility of sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farm hall for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the land women are always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Even the butcher was discovered for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to hope that during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether there are a direct market in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of the rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, the new project should probably not be low."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "" why shopping Palace in Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothes, shoes, drud- or supermarkets: I find it superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many charges are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"however, there is not even a regular weekly market, it's all the more important that at least get the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producers and is obstructive inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as one sees, Ladin stores in a shopping center will only be reserved for larger companies, because the dorms are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specials are there almost no longer and what still exists, will probably still disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a Markthalle does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the farmers market hall during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or creates the ghosts bit previously, all the shops from Bitburg to expel?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Miquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmers market hall it is thanks to the wahnous many - as I find - sensual construction projects in Bitburg no place more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant's market hall is shuttled, a piece of culture will again disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost insignificant - that hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and hair-sectioning who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning lapped the cuts out of the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret services Analytics sent a 35-year prison sentence after it made publicly known as a secret diplomatic reports about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resembbin (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline, their expertise in technology, computer science and arts, and Manning, a transwife and pioneering dissied, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has created through the sculptural analysis of DNA, which was created by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, like anyone with these genomic data - the many ways, how they can be interpreted, and the indural determinism of these interpretations, but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already talked about the identification as a woman, was condemned in 2013 due to 20 accusations, including six violations of the espionageAct, or theft and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-white selfie, in which manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinblonde Pergap - with which it was associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012-project "stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in that, the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette lighter and chewing gum by removing the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a magazine magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while they were in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg at a press release of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time, and she could not be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea, and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and its detainted muse became unequal spectacles that interchangeable in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of the Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" "Suppressed Images," which would foreseen a future in which the President Chelore judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally. "</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was published, creing liberation after seven brutal years would demand in a military bulation in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy cognition."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also a little deeper and bargain since the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads to a war against informants out of the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweeter, which he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg after the strange timing of all these things was asked, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery's written artistic statement called Manning with its oversized signature, including (the" "i" "in their surname is provided with a heart) an end to the" automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandals of Cs and GS, and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary (artist) to show how amazing similar, at least in biological ways, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring along, is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows manning as it appears with a free precarious position in the hand of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech, then they have won, says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote me," "said the artist, who pours out of Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get geek when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the midst of the room from their own genomic simmer, which coincides as hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also target-oriented, as everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, creings Stature), in which their genetic haploggroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a human being," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted that it feels like a mass movement that deformed with Chelsea, like the movement, which was also hidden behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can not happen in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, in fact."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take their climb seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen developed by their inflatable partners to robotic with a silicone skin that feels warm - with aware of human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs" "and choose everything from the eye-color of the robot to the type of nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still disturbing, because many robots have the" personalities "who would look like a stepford-woman of progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicone retina.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the real Botix robot allows for example to customize their robot to the properties which they find attractive, such as student."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of pupil and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality. "</seg>
<seg id="2402">Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible and warms the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so, you like what you like, and she does not like what you may not like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" in mood. ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subdivided female properties, the Annodes on rape, if one goes a step on Frigid (said here: resisting) Farrah, beatized one most."</seg>

<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why do men then have no Roxxxy?" it is called on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their creation and increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper into our culture to retreat from the ideal for gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjection as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course have no sex robot, and while FRR reviewing its increasing popularity, they still remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what leaks out of the edge zones, can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or animated until they give permission to the free market.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain abundance that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time where the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there has been a president in the White House who has sled to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">The deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images that slew the swallowed body and the outochy eyes but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robot is to make a physical similarity with actual women as realistic as possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want to make themselves human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to its" personalities, "the robots represent no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate yourself from their companion or simply walk away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they do not have any mediation or a background history, nothing that might hinge on independence or anything that might disturb the fantasy of total subjugation."</seg>

<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the provisioning effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" "normalization" "and Trump, we refer to the grassy possibility that we can no longer cope with the kittens of one day."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is a yet long-time scenario in the Trump Republicans of the Right wing" normalized, "which suddenly appears to its standards suddenly as inlay of denial."</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammation rankings) "</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflamed intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition that affects in the US some 1,3 million and in the UK 300,000, causes stomach crates and paralysis, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while sufferers may normally get out, meat and milk products steer to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found researchers at the Washingtoner University that contributes to the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins to contribute to promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immuncells in the intestine said to make sure the harmful microbes, who hide in the food not intrusion into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of disintegrate inflammations are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result from inflamed bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments was noted that a kind of tolerance of promoting immune cell is found in mice that contain a particular bacterium in their initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins to dissolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one at Tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflamed intestinal milieus promotes when the same system is also with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral studies in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when it found out that a group of study corporations had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe but had not been lodged."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they assumed that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbians of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the damme of the mice became DNA sequencing, and were found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them lacking in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterilous environment so that they were missing a intestinal microbiom, and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria controlled on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri introduced in a liquid and then overled small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was cleansed, it proved to be an outproduct of the tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as an Indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers hit the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanlevels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect us in our stomach-intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in people like with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflamed intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially a high degree of dreams can lead to an expansion of these populations.</seg>

<seg id="2887">"the police now ask witnesses of the forebear, as well as the driver of the dark experience, taking place among Tel. 05761 / 92060 with the commissioner in Stolzenau."</seg>
<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report demrelieved Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report to the abuse of the abuse of the Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weissensing, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church, "stated after the publication of the Deutsche Presse-Agentur, he anticipated by the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Benedict Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve to the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret on their own substitutes, or their then false evaluation of the proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" Osservatore Romano "," in contrast, criticised that in reporting on violence in the cathedral-cats with "two measure". ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the transitions in Regensburg no one doubt that it must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of medial Manipulation "," thus the "degree of medial Manipulation", "thus the" degree of medial Manipulation "," such as the "degree of medial manipulation," "says the" degree of medial manipulation, "the historikerk and a member of the National Italian Bioethic Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit that designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal for normal", "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "you would like to go on the church and this is a frozen frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" beats a quite normal pedagogical means "" to be with cheeky children as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they are unfair to use today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about the abuse of abuse often also Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger was often applied.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"fully wrongly, author and historians Michael Hesemann, who was translated with Ratzinger the reminder band" "My brother of Pope" "(translated in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take George Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the Bistum Regensburg with enlightening attorney to Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of overprint, 67 domain sparrows sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, this means that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms physical and psychic violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially in high Emotional ality, the punishment of the students could also remain fierce."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused, many victims were estimated by R. R., and therefore in many cases, despite violence even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview Hesemann, why the final report for the abuse scandal against the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the "Precasualties of violence against the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"as a result, many students stand up his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who was tangible, when a Domspatz has no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and read all of the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one must be wondering why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just dedicated to eight sides and he will clearly be acquitted from any suspicion of mediate or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the non-violence at the pre-school occurred outside its presence."</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can pre-throw him if too late or have taken first orders not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Dompointed-Secondary School, on which he worked, was received by virtually all respondents than -" "salvation", "" heaven "and" better world "." "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the broad majority of his pupil Georg Ratzinger also describes him an excellent record, describes it as" warm, "" sincerely, "" proficiently, "" competent "," and "understandably", "" sincerely, "" competent "," and "understandably", "" professed with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons and "always encamped by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high adulterality, which also led to woutees."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only skinned with chairs and cast out the key blows on the ground, but also ear-hearted and too freer guys over the hair or ears, he has already existed for years ago, deeply deplores and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his honor of salvation must however be said that such guardians were widespread in the fragment time, the 1960s, and 1970s, were widespread in parents like in teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeder methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a worldly school, a state Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and nonviolence at the pre-school, are the free Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you ask yourself whether it is not likely to do with his familiarity and his role as the brother of Benedikt XVI., that many media is straight on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him still, still eagerly."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieved Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, the report was very much reported about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger put in the final report as well as some complication or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No single of the 67 victims of sexual transitions claims to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dreamed to speak with my father or my mother," "said a sadness assistant for the others," "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true issue in the education of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they don't even trusted parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen pupil Rocks's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a respondent student formulate it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... not the case in which he would have had such results (Georg Ratzinger) timely knowledge and could have the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that in him... Buying an urgent or clearer or even more likely to have opened as compared to their parents, internatsled, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report comes to the very clear outcome:" "that the students involved in the advance of the students, and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the study."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to address any other hand."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, he cannot be pre-thrown, not preventing or put it on display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to connect its good name to these conflicting crimes, as it was unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was a lot of "" non-violence "" with the Regensburger Domspatzen. "</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is discarded in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage it was mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the midst of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that's exactly what is in turn the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there will be clean; between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals with occurrences from the time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a chorus of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which lad of sadistigated teachers were intercepted and disputed, and among them detained, all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to have rules."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those had Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boy only to face when she had already been on the Domar Secondary School."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this was, as most witnesses emphasise, the theme of" "Vorschule" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even 'paradise.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspitz School?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but there was no savicious violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" "many victims engendered the general humanity of R. R., and therefore, in many cases, despite violence even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, most still remains the accusation to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods, in which he was reported by the states on the preschschule."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was not responsible for the events at a school where he didn't want to hear and be responsible (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Disclosure Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspitz vasiums, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he shows that," that in the pre-school continue to be practised. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the risk of negative media channels he recommended urgent intrusion.</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course, this was at a time when legal clarity existed, as a check-in was also recently banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they recorded in a legal gray area, like everyone of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was hard to estimate for him where the persons affected might be exaggerated, or dramatized and where really the permissible border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can also not say, he always had a look."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test of schools were officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards on the then period."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk there from the" pitfalls of the Anachronism, "so the danger, the present day according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since the intercession has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not of course apply to sexual abuse who was abomable at all times, and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of reflection and violence in untrained children's sects, which goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take George Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punishment, thus earching and to pull in hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment is then forbidden, he has also kept strictly in it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his Regensburger Time has given Georg Ratzinger because in discussions with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject check in the language also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, that the cathedral-cats played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I didn't mean that he led a stricter regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible to form a institution of Welfare, true cultural message of Europe and its musical tradition, which went to the USA twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone you do not make a big singer and stand before every success, in which area, however, discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger in the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work of the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger really well and over again as wonderful, humorous, grounded, deep-believers and savvy people, of which one could not imagine that he could only do a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get along with, like many former cathedral-cats still today, 23 years after his emuling, regularly contact him, visit him, he is almost blind and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those that were not forgiven to him today, so that he was once strict to them, so are clearly at the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect for respect to which they still have a look and to worship them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, again, quite clear: all that one throws with him are guardians, which were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long ago been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust one man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make for the medial sinful sin."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention that is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieved him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the rank-areas, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bayerns and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen finally in peace."</seg>
