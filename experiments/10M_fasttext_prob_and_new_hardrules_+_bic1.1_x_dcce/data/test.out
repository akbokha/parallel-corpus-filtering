Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made it clear of Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; I will always put in drawers , or get dressed from the outside label that usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are rather sn@@ ap . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as they explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .

gol@@ fers Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf trainer in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought Bernhard Lan@@ ger , with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a walk on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a couple of minutes , the horses reminded itself on their celebrations , they said at the fast gal@@ lop in their house at the feed . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the equ@@ est@@ arri@@ ers ended up again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he did not lead himself to his family through the installation of the AL@@ RV on a horse he did not give himself a photo .
&quot; long was the first time at Aachen , and therefore with CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German spor@@ tive sur@@ passed the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small Gala the Gol@@ dene Sport@@ pyram@@ ide .
in distinc@@ tions it does not lack the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already saved him .
long is the 18 pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners of the athle@@ tic pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner of Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means me much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger supports the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro next .
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two triple US mast was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; among the excellent belong the athle@@ tics of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Fe@@ el E@@ ber@@ hard Gi@@ essen , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spring@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spring@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spring@@ deca@@ i Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand of all Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men were coming to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative Society emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
to invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; un@@ one , the two US presidential elections are however in tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in the economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to pun@@ ish the economy to death and regulate death he says .
&quot; on the other hand , it would be completely different , has claimed Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will break the regulations massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax sets - for private professionals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , Clinton says : the state has specific tasks to meet , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the needs to be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost wor@@ t@@ equal . &quot;
the Democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ ee @-@ wing of the Re@@ public@@ ans .
in Tru@@ mp you could find even more party @-@ internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build carbon power plants and resume the cohesion of coal in the US again .
oil Promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement .
Clinton and Clinton wants to expand and demand renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs .
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ ose @-@ fish trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them want to isol@@ ate the USA from international trade , but simply want to protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be , then he says , he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp is that the economy and citizens want to rel@@ ieve the growth to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold him before , so that the budget deficit would only be bigger . &quot;
&quot; at the other side Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every whis@@ per@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women who fled alone , almost to everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sit four women .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has placed their little son in the arms .
he caught with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until they notice that she is observed .
it sm@@ iles short and k@@ issed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria , and deals with the topic women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are fled .
&quot; in Mün@@ chner , they live in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all@@ ot@@ ted women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs joined the facility together with Pro Familia and the estu@@ ary of women &apos;s assistance .
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has done on her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope &quot; , &quot; she tells them . &quot;
&quot; among women , other reasons for escape : &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , honorary , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end , once they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here also here , women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and worse if mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the North of Munich , who are trau@@ mati@@ zed in the area of Munich . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to that they say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; because they often do not help , they need more accommodations just for them , invites them . &quot;
the seven District ruling classes in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; on the question whether you are using a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , we answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are so something in homes of governments not . &quot;
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben , women are not separated themselves alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , sub@@ - and medium @-@ fran@@ ken there are in some community shel@@ ters or separate houses for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception to Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men separately .
&quot; in a study that was published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separately houses . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing , men and women are missing , it may be - constant violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , washing rooms should be easily accessible and can be easily accessible for women . &quot;
&quot; as much the women sense of this protective need , it is possible to dism@@ iss the cr@@ ush that there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have spoken around , that there are us , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily set up a second house .
assistant strikes : demands for new employment measures
&quot; representatives of the assistant leaders have called their trade union to be a new employment measures , with their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded his entire council since the beginning of September more labour @-@ measures .
&quot; the J@@ DC said , that it would have hosted ministers to respond to the concerns of the contract . &quot;
&quot; assistance and medical students have agreed upon the rejection of a contract in July , which was agreed with BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members which voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was released on Twitter on Thursday evening , said the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court that the government was &quot; per@@ v@@ ingly quiet &quot; to problems , which resulted in the contract rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and requested the official re@@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has put a formal request at a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to escal@@ ate a running program escal@@ ating labour measures , which begin at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to that assistance in the year were sixteen , the first total inci@@ dents in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the director of the BM@@ A assistant Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions , which were recommended by BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he divided BM@@ A members during meetings , which were still found before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 Assist@@ enz@@ aries and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister of Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt is that the Treaty for physicians to be introduced in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of external side@@ ways &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday , to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight months of the long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the Con@@ gol@@ ild@@ ed Hall of St. Petersburg Palace in Rec@@ eption , I cannot toler@@ ate myself that Ankara will most want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles , nar@@ ro@@ wer and radiant little heat , even for his res@@ trained conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , in contrast , spoke to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report full of five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but they can even improve . &quot;
the next day there was a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan so heard that Erdo@@ gan as if never had anything worse .
to me it seemed more to be the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin des@@ radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the State of Russia had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first one that he mentioned in his em@@ bodi@@ ment : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey . &quot;
Moscow from response to time was awakened .
Putin distributed and accused Ankara to have Russia in the back .
the decay was even larger as it was committed by a supposed friend .
Vet@@ ro@@ en will rebuild once again if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months long , the nation@@ ally controlled media introduced a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one time , it seemed as if the Turks bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; the most serious accus@@ ations were the accus@@ ations of the officers , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria would have benef@@ ited from the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state . &quot;
he has denied this veh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was , that it is time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received by President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ceas@@ e@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan is first and foremost all the friends that he can get after spending last month at a failed state @-@ coup almost of his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ fs .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and char@@ ter@@ companies will be facilitated when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
you count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week predic@@ t the state remote watching cheap fruits and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agricultural impor@@ ters will be allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti forms it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West since it was the reaction to the tried to consider the power of power as a weak answer .
&quot; to this end , the persistent Gro@@ ll on the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to take advantage of the cool mood and decrease the relation of Turkey to the west . &quot;
&quot; the Russian president won in Ankara , with security a bonus that he called after the trying coup to support for the elected government bodies . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ deserved for Moscow - a matter of course , which has changed a deep @-@ sitting fear of the regime . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey , one as it was once an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of external side@@ heads &quot; : two countries that violate the West and have been poorly treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey can support opposing pages . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours of initial discussions , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said that they would not even have had the issue . &quot;
&quot; the president of Turkey avoided it clearly to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential as a complete disp@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey has reached the Russian mar@@ tial arts - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State at least talk to each other . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
&quot; according to the leadership of the Bank R@@ BS , the brand R@@ BS will be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the pre@@ condition of the Bank . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS joined the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since they had almost collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; at this time , brand @-@ str@@ ate@@ gen &quot; R@@ BS will be used to protect other end consumers . &quot;
they supported the international sport with a million pounds of sponsorship from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon champion Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to push more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange has to switch to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business , which are more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors brand , as well as the brand , under which our employees will be employed because we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank has become a global brand , R@@ BS has become a global brand . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say now we have no global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these marks will be in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work under these marks with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that the Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing will no longer continue and that it will increase the perception of the different brands in his sport sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop back to the Bank of brands , as we focus on within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the leader of the leader . &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we had told that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these marks .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , think I will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these marks again , therefore I think that the time has come . &quot;

&quot; the three @-@ day winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won previously on G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy that it &apos;s done with New@@ market , because I am at the end of 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the jubil@@ ee while he takes the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the barriers - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4.@@ 300 victories in a re@@ br@@ ittle career .
&quot; ester Pig@@ go@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best yod@@ elling of the modern age and there is no surprise that he has reached this milestone which only a few before him have reached .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect which differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans have been enthusiastic for this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched up of 6@@ ,000 profits , if he would not only be a weekend of weekend ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered a winner in the UK for nearly 30 years now .
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a brilliant race but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;

Russia Putin hum@@ id Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has dism@@ issed his Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years of the closest confidence of confidence by Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin was arranged without giving any reason &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ovo of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was dep@@ uty since 2012 was appointed to his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his degree at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website ( in Russian ) , it is called on Russian ) that he was later headed by the chief manager and the manager of the government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state , and to support the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
persu@@ ade the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time in one of the most vulnerable Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men said that the Stab@@ at is returning on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only few of them convinced - above all right now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
this is why nobody knows .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man , who once was formed as a potential president , would once again lead to the Russian environmental policy - came to great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments on Putin , cited on the website of Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I was asked for a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ ained job for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been president of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; before , he was Deputy Minister of Minister and Defence Minister . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his substitute . &quot;
&quot; when Putin was transferred to the power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he is most familiar . &quot;
once Ivan@@ ov was adopted that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia as a third term coup against the constitution .
&quot; but this post was taken by another , non @-@ country allies , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became president for three and a half years later .
&quot; criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son , after he made producers &quot;
Gib@@ son was part of a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles .

Queens@@ sal Cros@@ sing Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ deck Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - what means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four verses of the &quot; &quot; Deck@@ geb@@ se &quot; , &quot; which gradually approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 shr@@ ub@@ les . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today , Economic Affairs K@@ eit@@ h Brown offers a visit today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the que@@ er cross trainer . &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineers of a truly ep@@ ic measure at this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel that were used alone for that part of the bridge .
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity , which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck in their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a Bet@@ ong@@ ated for the Deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first clas@@ p represents a significant milestone in any bridge project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the clas@@ p @-@ forward high@@ - and deep @-@ building represents .
&quot; after installing the last stre@@ ak section and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , then we had to close existing gap on the north or highway . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; solid , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 222 meters long is , approx . 6@@ ,000 tons , and at a gradient of approximately 3 % had to be pulled up . &quot;
&quot; mar@@ kel , because the tolerances on which the team is working , tiny - on each side they were praying only a few millimeters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot; after they were thrown away from their fishing boat before fro@@ g@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ arding station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around itself and set us the worst before , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds made the boat already out of their range , until we left to water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and at a boat without life@@ jacket has been found . &quot;
they all arrived on board the coast of the coast and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; The three men who were cast into the water , have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot@@ engine had such a p@@ stop@@ pers , but these holes are controlled by the person from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has known today about these men .

who builds Braunschweig / cheap apartments ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and Green mean : investors are supposed to be much stronger in the future . &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig is losing nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; Acces@@ sibility for the next R@@ ats@@ session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but war is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; Mr Brat@@ mann says : &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , there must be 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also arise in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big issue of the city hall is however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want to build with investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing market , which will cost millions of costs and must be financed for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as viol@@ a : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left does not want to increase hardness for investors .
&quot; regardless of what , as viol@@ a , bah@@ s a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the apartment market . &quot;
&quot; the action concept will be implemented , which will provide additional tasks in building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
&quot; however , the program is not entirely different : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments whose support will run in the next few years ?
only by the year 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
&quot; to prevent this , so the plan@@ ing spokes@@ person in Nicole Palm , should now be able to buy @-@ on ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the apartments would have to be thought back into the price ratio . &quot;
this is possible in the west city .
on one stroke will solve the problem .
for in the west city you will run at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price of cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the Western city dramatically increases , it is the aim of the so @-@ called through @-@ Mix . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social weak in only a few districts shall no longer be able to give it . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens thus count that there will be more movement in the discussion .
&quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must go into a boat . &quot;
it is concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .
&quot; Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teen@@ ager and child go out no more outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , on screens too rigid , was lam@@ ented in the last decade of many lam@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; at Po@@ k@@ em@@ on Go , it is about to get people from the sofa and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters , which initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later came into a cartoon series , game cards and other spin @-@ off ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of the Pop@@ ulation , the interest before the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand began something in early July . &quot;
the launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server over@@ bur@@ dened .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players are going to go outside with their smartphone and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons who are re@@ trac@@ ed with a GPS and once they were found once , &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the w@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that returns the average &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 3@@ 5.000 users , divided the Washington Post recently with that within two days of launch of the game , the number of watched people who atten@@ ed every day 30 minutes , by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays at Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to improve performance .
&quot; many public education campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes time &quot; , &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; active to be active &quot; , &quot; because many public messages to health are boring and coming to people that look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be evaluated . &quot;
&quot; who drives on a regular exercise , reduces its chances to prevent cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful thing about Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that they are fun . &quot;
&quot; three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always there are also cosm@@ opolitan game , which must always complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what is it supposed to do ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
&quot; due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and to help many people on hunting , more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ age
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the spr@@ ing@@ horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now finally Olympic stadium .
&quot; the 19 year @-@ year American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to multi @-@ struggle titles , and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games . &quot;
your overall results of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 lay clearly before the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ kam@@ ad@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ cem@@ ent@@ ail@@ er Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American lady Simone Bil@@ es presented on the pig @-@ bal@@ es during the individual multi @-@ amp@@ ff@@ in@@ ales of women in the Olympic summer , in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americans who wins a multi @-@ scale title and overall the fifth , while she has soli@@ di@@ fied its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , as her grand@@ result was shown , and her long journey at that moment was an end . &quot;
&quot; this success puts it into the same League as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , which brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years her sports species - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the olymp@@ ic winner of 1984 Mary Lou b@@ on of her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she was expecting her last test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ amp@@ ff@@ in@@ ale of women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , won . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal at Tuesday , while on the departure celebration of the reti@@ ring team coordinates in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as a footh@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on the top , during their long hike to the top , never the future planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of its soil exercises - which included its typical Tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not an accident .
&quot; this girl , which was adopted by her grandparents as a small child , and by Train@@ ers A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother was discovered during a school@@ ing in the gymn@@ asium , was appointed to power . &quot;
&quot; it has no longer been lost since the summer of 2013 , a strainer series that will hold so long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two kno@@ bs , dec@@ eived the image . &quot;
pig and Bo@@ dent@@ es - in which Bil@@ es hold the World Cup title - lou@@ der .
she resum@@ ed up with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the float up again - and he sat on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ im@@ pover@@ ished her as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ ale - a pure form@@ ality - and tears , on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once was in their collective book , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the Bronze Med@@ al was in a zo@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year team capit@@ alized , which is called by Americans &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after its soil exercise , she threw her to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ arks , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes doub@@ ted . &quot;
what is concerned with how quickly the T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old have a completely new meaning at the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in serial mur@@ der@@ fall during the music @-@ shot in the car
&quot; according to police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl shot they were killed in one of the mor@@ tal attacks since a decade in the first series of production , while they were talking in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a single @-@ drive , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators of eight shots from a hand @-@ hum@@ id weapon , while he stood on the passenger &apos;s side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report to read . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the triple murder did not have been the result of a boot@@ leg , as the att@@ acker did not took the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shal@@ lows the investig@@ ators to become a closer look at that if it is connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic dwell@@ ings were killed in nine months in nine attacks , and two other in@@ jured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , distributed Howard of K@@ HP@@ O , an affiliate of CB@@ S , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles has used , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to susp@@ end the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized because of their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ ah died still on site . &quot;
a witness of the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and to listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shal@@ e , which was taken on an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial m@@ ör@@ ders . &quot;
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine space .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of its age , Ed@@ mund micro@@ ep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy did not know . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought , I did not do that . &quot;
I do not manage this .
I did not let myself here .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has let himself in it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her husband has been told that Ed@@ mund , they may never realize that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they prec@@ eded it to institu@@ tion@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; stated Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit either kr@@ ab@@ bles up to his third year and he can still not speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
he can run and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the character language , which Ed@@ mund has made me something out of &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign speech &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to CB@@ S News . &quot;
but there is no typical string -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as Mas@@ s or Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it is influ@@ encing the life of the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds itself of the emotional price of a certain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she is still not yet real .
I have not been asked for a long time after the progn@@ osis because I am not observ@@ atory that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth @-@ threads caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
you know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

the Wetter@@ dienst left out that in this area additional 3 to 5 inch could fall in rain .
in the south Al@@ ab@@ amas was used on Friday a Fl@@ ut@@ early war@@ n@@ system while it was ra@@ ined in the area mobile .
&quot; the river Com@@ ite close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will find all the lik@@ eli@@ hood of over the weekend record . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could have many houses in the subur@@ ds near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a up@@ stream of flood in Ascension is a danger , as these are flowing through the be@@ aten rivers , only slowly into Lake Mau@@ re@@ as . &quot;

the other two victims were not found in the car and the police have just found whether one of the most recent men of the perpet@@ rators could be found .
investig@@ ators shared CB@@ S Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cruci@@ ble between several guns .
&quot; Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for Stur@@ m@@ ge@@ we@@ ary , which were persec@@ uted to different pet@@ rels , are se@@ wn the Tat@@ ry . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly to be tra@@ ded to a continual battle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk , they found H@@ ül@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; thus , it seems to have been here several armed warri@@ ors who were very active involved , &quot; divided police skin at Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the Police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles made in the area .
&quot; there came to no forti@@ fications , and the police are currently checking the surveillance video currently . &quot;
on Tuesday another six @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ r@@ ack@@ et on the arm when she played before her house in the neighborhood of the West Oak Lane .
she recovered and the police is still looking for a susp@@ ects .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I present to me under the Women &apos;s Olympics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been in the summer for 1984 since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lic@@ in is , p@@ round , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has led the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female tur@@ no@@ isse@@ urs an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising olymp@@ ic prize and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to witness a witness of the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone is the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americans , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ board event for women gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are witness@@ ing the tip of this sport , but you will not see your classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie smote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the olymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; L@@ alled Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four tur@@ ers in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ k is a more expensive sport and tur@@ ner in first place in private trainers who will be sustained by parents , which will pay for training , furnishings , travel and hotel cost ( for the trainers and their do@@ ers and families ) . the list will continue to continue . &quot;
the majority of these trainers are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these verses , the tur@@ ner received her overall training and that is for the families a good and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired to the municipalities au@@ n countless , young girls that are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , allow for a good and easy access . &quot;
I was founded my turn@@ around 20 years ago .
&quot; at my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ f in Harlem for over 15@@ ,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) , and national and international winners . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer youth @-@ quality tower which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olymp@@ ic sport .
&quot; develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline , and determination for the mind . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for educational and professional success . &quot;
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , which bring thousands of young girls to get interested in the teeth and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ der of the olymp@@ ic team Con@@ gol@@ ds and thanks , F@@ ass you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance practitioners want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ ,000 assistance practitioners who voted against him at a choice . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt have been unveil@@ ed to introduce the contract concluded and said that N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and would be harmful for the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance practitioners will receive a new treaty , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve the maintenance of service times . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Committee on Assist@@ enz@@ practitioners shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance practitioners , in particular , that there will be the current workforce crisis and it will be wast@@ ed to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks , which still remain until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , need to be made progress and the time is running out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve any dispute through talks during the government on resistance and sometimes in de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; that happened to a promise , the Jerem@@ y Hunt had only made last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hunt must act now to lift up the penetration and address the concerns of assistant practitioners .
&quot; if he did not do this , so the assistant &apos;s assistance have made clear that they are ready to carry out further labor measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100.000 termin@@ ations , since nur@@ ses and experts were involved to cover doctors on the strike post@@ head . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the re@@ formed contract with the functions of the British Medical Association .
&quot; BM@@ A would like to have a better week@@ day remun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4,000 practitioners who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Direc@@ torate of the N@@ HS employees , called for the assistant to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; employment measures do not reach anything of the only little , but even betra@@ yed teams and service providers and prepare the patient , peac@@ em@@ ers and their families only worry , need and interruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the Committee of the assistant and responded to the Ministry of Health and other ministries , positive to concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility at training , training courses for those who were employed by a vocational training period , training , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , health education and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with agreements with BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
£ 2 @-@ per day@@ - drug which can reduce the heart attack
thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period .
the ger@@ inner drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack . &quot;
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has been recommended for a four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has been recommended for a four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stroke are caused by accum@@ ulations fatty material in the arter@@ ies that constitute har@@ row .
&quot; when the covering breaks , it can cause a blood flow that is pet@@ ri@@ ft of blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood flow is redeemed , it can flow through blood stream and the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is driven under the commercial name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cells un@@ probable . &quot;
&quot; the inauguration of N@@ ICE , which today was released today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Caro@@ le Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Research Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary school children , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack - often with dis@@ astrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attack and stroke inci@@ dents with people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by provisional recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available therapies to thousands of people who benefit from it . &quot;
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ a@@ - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the executive design recommends no treatment that eman@@ ates over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tor can flour@@ ish in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report because of corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tor has led to widespread electoral campaigns in Muslim congregations are know@@ ingly ignored as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es acc@@ esses the police , electoral watching and Rath@@ thouses to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; superi@@ ority &quot; regarding eth@@ ni@@ nie and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , which now is a cor@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist , said that the police intim@@ id@@ ation of constitu@@ ents from religious motives were so bad that it should be permitted by the police to set up lock@@ ers outside of voting , to intim@@ id@@ ated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a sign with themselves in order to prove their identity with elections .
&quot; at the moment , a voters must simply call its name and ad@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person if they give their choice vote to prevent someone twice . &quot;
whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection says Sir Eric .
he calls that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or work@@ groups .
&quot; this not only serves electoral campaigns , but is also intended to protect the municipal government in front of the broader corruption and financial intermedi@@ ary culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets El@@ ection and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court decided that the acting mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man had to corrupt to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ated the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal manner and that he would have brought his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ opho@@ bia to silence .
&quot; one should have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that there is the rel@@ ati@@ ous duty of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation , where one person is chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that in the whole country there was evidence of fraud .
&quot; in particular , he expressed especially alar@@ ming to frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - at the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people had made a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the filling out of artic@@ ulation to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it said : &quot; &quot; as proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the Will of El@@ ders , in particular communities with Pakistan or ban@@ ker background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions had such a behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; superi@@ ority &quot; regarding eth@@ ni@@ nie and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban , that political activ@@ ist correspondence can process to &quot; election &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , demands also harder registration for registration , to prevent the electoral directory for mig@@ rate and welfare purposes . &quot;
consider options in advance of choice after your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person once they have given their voice to prevent someone twice .
systematic re@@ inst@@ ations on the nationality of a person to carry out to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic post@@ code .
prohibition that political activists process complete envelope and uph@@ e@@ als of mail @-@ elections .
the police give the authority to set up the bul@@ ations for voting stations .
a legislative change that facilitates an indictment for intim@@ id@@ ation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People Representative Act 1983 ) .
photo@@ grap@@ pled in election stations .
request that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( except for Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees will usually assert that voters want to go alone in the election . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets no crime was put . &quot;
&quot; the electoral Tribunal has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his substitute for due to a paraly@@ sis in corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; said he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons for the sake of a number of reasons , he ple@@ aded not guilty to the high demands in the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critici@@ zed the effective &quot; det@@ h@@ act controls &quot; of the election divisions of the Rath@@ thouses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Angel of Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country contributes to the mother of parliaments a proud heritage , but the worrying and covered propag@@ ation of electoral ran@@ ged and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ bil@@ ites in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ers in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are gone by the French Rad@@ sport Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except edge and band who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ predec@@ essors in the Duke of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ ad this summer is by far not the only one of gold struggles , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not to give the social media belief . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ ouring the Olympic Games in Rio and all of the famous faces , which at the time created on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has made a list of Olympi@@ ans that have more than just a certain similarity with Dutch , most famous . &quot;
&quot; the hunters and the Wolf : team member of the US team at Ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ate double destinations on the cycle track , there are many people on the net that could be like a certain ar@@ cher of the Twin @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team at Ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a tower on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got a mad@@ ness in social media and gave it that he has already heard his childhood since his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see a big similarity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; told Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I say that probably as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly highlight this year : the striking similarity between the British Weit@@ br@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes should be crossed as a double predecessor for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron is compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one step higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nice who has similarly severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian Silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the son@@ nen@@ m@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan was Adrian von fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar faces and eyes &quot;
not the one : a Twitter user was very happy about that others have also liked the similarities
&quot; The@@ ory is put into the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple perhaps one reason . &quot;
&quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ ine explained their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are nearly identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular Ver@@ ri Wal@@ sh Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to the von act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in the Tower Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , wide smile , which resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle . &quot;

we spent yesterday night quickly with our spectators on the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in social media .
&quot; to make it clear , b@@ yr@@ ons comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and a unhappy chosen formulation . By@@ ron does something he has said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , Mac@@ Donald will ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the show and tried to justify his remarks by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack . &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged over woman who are trying to wear without under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see them , when a woman moved her clothes in the midst of a mark to try sub@@ du@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , they mu@@ st@@ ed how she saw in it , she moved out and laid them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she moved on and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone , . &quot;
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ p@@ ants before they put it back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman tried the under@@ wear , she moved again and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the outlet , moved their own ti@@ ghts and p@@ ants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discrete place to do it - it was simply there , nau@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; every star@@ red , when they turned out the under@@ p@@ ants that you obviously have not fallen , since they put it into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three further under@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that ye fell off and went down .
&quot; it did not seem to distur@@ b it that someone was watching or think about the person , who would not buy the under@@ p@@ ants that they tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; How to remember that someone would take straight away , who had a different person and were not washed away . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday morning .
&quot; Mrs Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I got involved , the staff tried to pull the clothing from the sale after it went - which is as good . &quot;
I would hate it to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants and figure out that another woman had her and moved again and they were not washed away .
&quot; said a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident occurring on Tuesday , the 9th of August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him safer for you .
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ Federation in New York to find out how to move to the end with armed forces . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are se@@ ated from the front or from the back , this video will show you how you turn into your incense . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re moving from behind , then you should turn out as an input , so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then strike it with the knee into the body and twi@@ sting you , while the att@@ ackers before pains collap@@ sed , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run and move back@@ wards , while they set the weapon upon him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers , which approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the loop , grab the weapon and twi@@ sting it so that the att@@ acker may not shoot . &quot;
&quot; shift at the same time the weight on the gun and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then twi@@ sting the weapon from its grip before they move back@@ wards and direct the gun to him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly as it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi Pre@@ makes .
&quot; but remember that it is the safest , your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right g@@ gle for a guide of his tongue to the nar@@ row@@ ful places of Europe
a bri@@ tish trav@@ eller laid down his immune system and throws into a serious examination - by placing some of the nar@@ ro@@ est and livel@@ i@@ est places of Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sch@@ ched his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush kno@@ b of a draw@@ backs , as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the res@@ ili@@ ence of its immune system . &quot;
in front of any object he used an ins@@ om@@ ometer to show up and show us what he will allow .
&quot; but the experiment , that was recorded under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the dish@@ on@@ kno@@ b to be out of a draw@@ backs , which has already been used by thousands of others , but actually are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right talked to physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of intest@@ ine bacteria , as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , I left nothing , what he tasted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right has been known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by playing through the world and ate peculi@@ ar as well as wonderful things .
public funds to train stations to flus@@ hing of toilets , the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; in the film he told me : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was definitely meeting with his reputation .
&quot; the one that he fails , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;

compared to this the L@@ umin@@ ometer is freshly picked @-@ up in less than 60 .
&quot; but there was a Russian res@@ tro@@ om , which he refused to collapse , after their L@@ umin@@ ators took over 4000 units , while fresh bread was one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the rice &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ i@@ ties in different places such as the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing I have in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
I will not check out here because it is here in@@ ven@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products . &quot;
&quot; the company acqu@@ et Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intest@@ ine bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we carried crazy bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming , which thus ended that we said &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to place it into a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I had lost my respect for Ian , when he tasted some of the things I have reli@@ ed to check out , as the ek@@ y Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things when it was easier to bring Ian , they anz@@ ul@@ ecken and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
&quot; I am glad , that we have received some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot;
&quot; in one of validation survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all surv@@ ey@@ ed l@@ actic acid bacteria conducted in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they contain at least occasionally products , which are included with l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social housing after a delay in the amount of £ 50,000 because they had spread their neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were removed from their property , sho@@ cked the property of the housing property found the property in a irre@@ par@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls reported k@@ la@@ ff@@ ed holes on , wooden di@@ mp@@ s have been ri@@ pped , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were spot@@ ted and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing said that they feared that the apartment was no longer to repair .
&quot; she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare and I think people will not have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is in@@ famous and their reputation is it too .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who in the meantime lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had attached the family , street struggles with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ sleeps , intim@@ id@@ ances of residents , drug abuse , drug wholesale and excessive scre@@ ams , streams and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old garbage was found &quot;
they were tra@@ ded in the property in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past drugs .
&quot; neighbours said that they saw her on the streets , and regularly ph@@ oned the police to be inv@@ oked . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing del@@ o@@ gi@@ erte her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ fied by the estate , after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to be deb@@ ated . &quot;
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors that said their lives are made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They sh@@ aded not anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are amazing . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not normal !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood International En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing , said that it had administered the family with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , for which the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
on the crowded side of the municipal house were rub@@ b@@ ish garbage and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that there was the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and the family , as a del@@ o@@ ing is always the last step that is taking into account the Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds for their neighbors had to be horrible .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have gr@@ aceful ourselves and have given us the information to have done . &quot;
I hope that this development will give up some neighbors con@@ sol@@ ation and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 the police conducted a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1.@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; skel@@ et@@ ons received a pen@@ al , after they had found guilty of the possessions of a drug of class B in commercial view . &quot;
&quot; they claimed the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who was born in 2013 in an auto accident . &quot;
&quot; after having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room@@ mates of the house were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will serve ten@@ ants that will not stick to the house
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ es was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stop the house .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can accept themselves without self @-@ looking , as well as those who have been damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

Donald Tru@@ mp Gl@@ ens ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Re@@ public@@ ans is hun@@ ted by massive worries even in the traditionally conservative federal states of their majority .
&quot; after the presidential campaign , Donald Tru@@ mp were now present weaknesses of its electoral campaign in the former Republi@@ can Hoch@@ sch@@ burg U@@ tah . &quot;
&quot; a rare moment , in which usually large sp@@ ur@@ ig and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , now they grow the doubt of his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ic Christians that he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; his fault is false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
re@@ publi@@ can floo@@ d@@ les
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; survey of Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , according to Tru@@ mp and his bank@@ rupt@@ cy by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as well . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by far the distance , which are common to re@@ publi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview by the Senate CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp rep@@ lied the question how he wants to stop the rise of Clin@@ ics : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than to tell the truth .
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end for the reasons of political correctness , be it ok , Tru@@ mp said further . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press release , the Party of Tru@@ mp should have threatened with funds to support his election campaigns , he should not present any better query values . &quot;
instead of how one wants to take the candidates of the Re@@ public@@ ans for the Congress more strongly among the arms .

&quot; the world &apos;s anti @-@ doping agency had exer@@ ted a lot pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ doping law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia start .
&quot; in the episode , the W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of countries whose intelligence fight con@@ forms to the rules of W@@ ada . &quot;

we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we have Bernard &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older wor@@ m@@ ary Mary .
she recalls with melanchol@@ y on her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first of all because she is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel that , oh so , I feel and we@@ ather@@ ty and th@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so , it is smart , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character , which I as Roman , laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of lob@@ es for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an extremely generous person .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back , &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
this is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is at all very important ! &quot;

&quot; it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees , his own land refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the exile was indic@@ ted by the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities . &quot;
thus Erdo@@ gan the outlet pressure on the remaining Kurds increase .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U @-@ member . &quot;

&quot; because that &apos;s so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ day struggle - which is attached . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the champi@@ ons are on vacation .
&quot; most of the holi@@ day@@ makers who are in the land , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a locals , so are not allowed to vote . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters re@@ hang , air balloon , fl@@ yers are spread and out at the end of the vote , only lab@@ ev@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; until 4th September 2016 , the election and the last Feri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass over just under the people of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if one can say that , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sella , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting , how strongly no@@ vice Af@@ D cuts down and what remains at the end of the body . &quot;
&quot; cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his grand@@ mothers . &quot;
&quot; he travelled through the land , spread ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , just as it was already his legendary liter@@ al predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , past@@ ering her old feet got and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame on the flo@@ wering of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing , which will probably cost him the lovely office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with her leading channel data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if you do at the wrong time at the right place of election campaign . &quot;
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to major reference ; Merkel Bundestag ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis lies in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg @-@ Westphalia and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other Länder , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is a shame to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
otherwise the North @-@ CD@@ U is largely disp@@ enses at the usual electoral stor@@ s on market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; so , it means co@@ ert , play only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that you are br@@ ittle the base on the country , that it has to be very strict , to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the expan@@ se of the country hardly any . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral campa@@ ign@@ ers , however , is also self @-@ extrac@@ ting : &quot; you must go there where it should be , namely where people are : Dor@@ is este , Gol@@ dene weddings , each birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is a lot on the game , cel@@ ering his SPD has now called to a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just below the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; during the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clear with 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , thir@@ st the leap into the land . &quot;
they make out of the holidays ad@@ versity a modern virtu@@ es and place their election campaign large part of the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; calls it the provincial Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the green election was on the search for local stim@@ uli among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top class did@@ atin , cur@@ t just with a house boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : pub suffer from blocking
&quot; at the speed , with which the B is 27 re@@ moves , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for construction , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and end only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are always praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty z@@ ak@@ y , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ pet@@ rol station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
&quot; the construction site could be moved to the south end of the weekend until the end of October , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ched also will also be the resign@@ ation of the work responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up housing cru@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the South , the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been removed and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has again been restored , the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now be moved from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the different traffic through the place seems to return .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the chief executive management of the Arti@@ sts Deputy Head of Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ man road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many are sought out and rather their Nav@@ i familiar as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what resulted in man@@ holes in residential areas .
&quot; even the speed limit changes have not been observed , the municipality demanded to be strengthened by M@@ ös@@ s . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable crossing , &quot; says King , who made himself on the spot over the location . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute blow@@ n .
the quick@@ est thing was on the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone at the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , but it has become more quiet . &quot;
for business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
business@@ men do not have to look into the maps .
&quot; but that the B has led 27 @-@ restoration with them to the revenue of sales , everyone , whom you ask . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less are affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; so for other companies , for whom the restoration has little consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also that of course the lear@@ ners are missing . &quot;
the strongest exploited are the roads along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds significant words . &quot;
this is already existence @-@ threatening .
&quot; not only him , but all the host places have hit it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was missing the customers of He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we must be glad about each euro sales .
&quot; the sales revenue is based on &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the street of the street gave its operation &quot; &quot; two years back . &quot;
half of his employees have to dism@@ issed him .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dism@@ issed , the policy would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , the President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner to whether there would be a financial compensation , with the reference , the guest @-@ place benef@@ ited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 Now it must also take the disadvantages , which result in the renov@@ ations . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where there was such a generous .
&quot; for all law@@ suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that its guest house will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family run since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; however , that other regul@@ ars are less common now because of complicated traffic routing less often , it can understand . &quot;
if you cannot drive it is also somewhere else .
&quot; that his root climate is coming back after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird @-@ flu , G@@ öh@@ ner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the greatest crisis that has experienced its guest house in its long @-@ term history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; constantly , in the name of the terrorist fight against laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thicker safety package . &quot;
but what has a D@@ ul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
&quot; all of his proposals are &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Minister for the presentation of his new safety package . &quot;
they are calling for anyone .
&quot; others , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I am also part of it . &quot;
&quot; but as an indoor Minister , it was based on results and a reco@@ ver@@ able consensus within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , he presents a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security of the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced that a new safety authority should take care of the b@@ aking co@@ ded communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU guidelines on passengers and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; part of the part starts de Mai@@ zi@@ ère a second step for suggestions , which had not been able to do with the SPD : he wants sympath@@ ie@@ ver for terrorist groups under punishment , and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; spatial the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , he does not consider this to be reasonable and demanding also nothing , which does not have any chances for co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they have in part in itself : he plans to de@@ port@@ ations for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for attachment of people from deportation .
&quot; refugees who are specifically fet@@ ched in the country before , they should leave their smartphone in @-@ check and open social media accounts for a safety check . &quot;
&quot; at D@@ ul@@ sions for distr@@ acted asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about such , the crimes , or their papers deliberately throw away in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legal .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of commem@@ oration for example - is the question : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; but it cannot be expressed in speech , that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many people in view of the high refugee numbers did not worry about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that are deeply employed people , have not been involved in electoral periods . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; first stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there is no choice . &quot;
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly focusing on internal safety in their position .
in the past few days it went up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ sti@@ ger argument on the equipment of the Federal Police , then over a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons , in which the res@@ ort@@ ages also ask a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also refers to irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able tones .
from a return of the double pass it is nothing .
we have free@@ zing the discussion in Germany .
they new to be up do not make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he did not have constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ ent to all corners , and whether it is &quot; &quot; acceptable &quot; &quot; for the co @-@ operation , it is necessary to show itself . &quot;
there is a lot in it that could worry about dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ spect@@ ating itself on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; light Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only as careful talk and says , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to the security . &quot;
&quot; yet , Volkswagen is still coming through . &quot;
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als the outlet figures rise around the world .
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the recall campaign we are looking for a term .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; in the course of the year , Europe &apos;s largest Motor@@ cycle , in spite of the diesel engines , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets continue to pass a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July weak@@ ened the nuclear brand VW mainly in Western Europe , and it is again res@@ ili@@ ent the overall sales , such as the companies settled in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; around the world sold VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year @-@ year @-@ month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , to China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ten the deliveries to almost a six@@ ties .
bran@@ ded Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the weak@@ est numbers from July mainly on two selling days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it has been given a department store in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um will also be charged to the resign@@ ation of the EU , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the car@@ bure@@ au first escal@@ ated , will also continue to be@@ ech a minus . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is passed on by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , there is merely an output minus of 0.@@ 9 per cent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
&quot; Fred Kap@@ pler , from January to July , Fred Cap@@ pler was able to proceed from January to July . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had t@@ amper@@ ed with a software subscription .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW is calling for around 2.5 million vehicles to adapt to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ armament of vehicles it will give no deterioration at fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine power . &quot;
&quot; the auto industry present the client after the conversion of a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason are legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; focus &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; had reported Volkswagen granted his German customers a guarantee of sc@@ aff@@ able diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW representative in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Culture has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fulfilled the conditions of my investigation Commission , and the KBA in full . &quot;
&quot; deviations of these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor performance after the retro@@ fitting does not take any deterior@@ ations and all type of application relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not how it was in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; on the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen the possibility that customers can come for example a half year after the retro@@ fitting , for example with a motor@@ harm in a workshop - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the client &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid that there are any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal dis@@ rup@@ tions regarding possible warranty conditions , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot;
the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity in future criminal off@@ ences - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; bank Head Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German association of German banks speak of an individual case , and does not see in it a signal : normal austerity would have to pay &quot; not to pay for their spar@@ se criminal law . &quot;
&quot; bearings banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent of criminal law . &quot;
&quot; this charge demands the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 Euro on Gi@@ ro@@ - or Tages@@ accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs EUR 400 in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
it has been around 40 million Euros that could be lifted by one day on the other and which he could not be able .
&quot; these lie with me on the balance account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; said the ban@@ quet . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie for any million 4000 Euros . &quot;
the costs shall be followed after the leg@@ alit@@ arian principle .
&quot; it is simply to be in the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four times , I would not go out the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the bank of the bank . &quot;
most of the customers would have an understanding and can be seen in other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association Bayern stated : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear alone , be &quot; &quot; economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for bank@@ roll , credit cards or credit transfers . &quot;
&quot; with offen@@ ders for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gia popular and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Country had made head@@ lines with their sk@@ ating bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , principal business leaders of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private clients have to pay wide coverage for in@@ soles , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a cliff , which is equipped with a little su@@ cking . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank for a problem , &quot; if they lost free money . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region there is known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative association Bayern &quot; are currently no further banks known , which comp@@ ute an out@@ la@@ wing of deposits of private customers , &quot; said Spe@@ aker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Federal Association of German folk banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives to the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
competition is hard and it dro@@ ught the migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not have fallen into the width .
destination plates : who does not buy sound plates ?
lonely men middle age love plates .
&quot; before you pass on to the comment@@ aries , to over@@ saw him under the pseudon@@ ym non @-@ avenue men with harsh ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the stated re@@ formation of sound plates not on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the novel@@ ties of physical objects , but due to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
&quot; those who have recently purchased one record , are all predic@@ tions after the age between 45 and 54 . &quot;
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
&quot; there is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional importance : older records reserve their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time to spend ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) . &quot;
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would like to follow the camera , while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a modest sli@@ pping tra@@ ge and wild , before I ste@@ aming my hands and be a bit of things like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ hos is slow on its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling up the buildings where independent sellers are located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman , to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and vegetables through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I run by Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) into the rec@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , presum@@ ably around the 20 ) is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
is he a collector that I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4.000 records . &quot;
&quot; sound plates , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot via email , I did not followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when she appeared and buy objects that he sold , when he was young and bank@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60@@ s , early 70@@ s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I probably was something to buy them , &quot; says he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend their own time , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much . &quot;
this is my em@@ aster .
&quot; NE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers meet , who meets the You@@ k@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; but he has also noticed a new wave of people that have been influenced by the medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and led to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually have been kidn@@ apped so by 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy back their records , &quot; says he . &quot;
this would explain the boom of the pres@@ et of a given age of age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to recognize that records a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
some records fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to pull back to the stability of familiar sound plates , of objects , the happ@@ ier Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a empt@@ iness or owned material possessions , as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says NE@@ Z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to engage in spiritually .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ are a staff from a record stack .
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April contained that almost 50 % of the people bought , the last month had bought a record , they have not heard yet . &quot;
&quot; the survey took out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy one record , do not own a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while I was going through a stack at Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works in sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men aged aged men ) has a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I do not own a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ ot@@ ead sound@@ plate so that I can put them into the shelf . &quot;
this is not a large percentage but it definitely happens .
&quot; more productive , less music small . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who have only slowly coming . &quot;
&quot; F@@ lop that has dedicated the sound panels almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle age . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ standing shops , Wild Be@@ asts of Syn@@ thesis and far @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz ro@@ ds from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them sees son@@ ant , but na@@ ecology mental trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ectable if one stands next to someone over 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around for some minutes in business and looks at the vari@@ ability of the plates available for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a man@@ ag@@ tal mor@@ tal as a big one .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a ador@@ ned disease .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , of which is said that a new generation of record owners should have inspired : urban outlet . &quot;
&quot; while I give the cont@@ end to mu@@ red the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observed a group of young teen@@ ager , looking for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think , to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees it - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is the most suitable for luxury conditions such as plates . &quot;

French court borrowed an offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , living in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; in case of jurisdiction this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Calais that the state should be fu@@ elled to sell 72 provisional services , in which persons available within the camp goods , from cigarettes to du@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Calais argu@@ ed that these places should be low , because they would pose a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid , and which is a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups , not enough food for the growing figures in the camp . &quot;
it also led out that provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the instruction of people who operate 72 provisional business , but that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Calais is absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much bigger role than those who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points for refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the rainf@@ all , was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , the non @-@ smoking and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ ,000 people signed the Pe@@ ti@@ tion to preserve the Kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian it says that the closure &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe would be , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants dro@@ w@@ aged on Friday , that the number of people in the jungle had risen on over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise in re@@ anchor in the course of the summer . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er needs to adjust to the next generation of speed measurements : in different federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic effective En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic , Wiesbaden can be used for instance at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction or to gentle bridges with temporary Tem@@ pole with there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary leaf for compliance with speed limitation . &quot;
a lasting mobile structure can be too dangerous or consuming .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; in addition , with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time . &quot;
variable speed limitation as well as transit bot@@ e to time , drivers and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
you can move the p@@ endant according to manufacturer by car with a trailer hit@@ ch .
&quot; that he is not simply cl@@ oned , he is lowered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally disappear also disappear . &quot;
it is also intended to protect a built @-@ in alarm system in front of V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer is tested according to specifications of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and now also used .
&quot; even foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technique : recently , France has reviewed 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday night at an ab@@ rupt halt on the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the defensive stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji shared a master class in the handling , side step@@ ping , push @-@ run and ro@@ forth power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ad in any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was destroyed by the non @-@ poor tro@@ phy of the Silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they smote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day might fall back in the final . &quot;
&quot; but independent of it , Fi@@ ji would have struck a 15 @-@ man team in existence in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be for GB a con@@ sol@@ ation - but it is probably not - that at least a bread medal will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former chief of England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind .
&quot; eight years ago , they lost under Ry@@ an each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this cap will be w@@ aning , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and caused the GB@@ s made of fun off .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co. in , when one would walk in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai has yet another attack on the right @-@ hand corner which he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly reached the ball .
&quot; a rep@@ lica of Mitch@@ ell St@@ eps the mountain from man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate to achieve , but it has kept Fi@@ ji only . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a Touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ release and there were over a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ted by another weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the rest .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still da@@ unting . &quot;
that is how it is .
&quot; GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time through and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went after a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for UK , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running long in favor of the southern Bohemia , whose fans beg@@ s , flags and d@@ anced on the Tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the cake cake with another try in the last seconds .
the p@@ fi@@ ff mu@@ te that Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ im@@ pover@@ ished themselves and GB k@@ ick@@ y crus@@ hed in the lawn .
&quot; earlier days Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated Fi@@ ji Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 , and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan &apos;s Nor@@ ton broke out the line with impressive foot@@ work and reached a gate under the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer for rowing
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ eres Gold than in these games and that wants what to be called .
&quot; from the first rowing down to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who were on the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present as she fought for the second olymp@@ ag@@ old in two without control , the first women in the history of the British Sports , which were laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9,@@ ter un@@ trained use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ esses , which gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflected the way of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the ruin , a batt@@ ali@@ on would contribute to the incre@@ mental advancement that make the difference between 30 months ago , who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with him cancer . &quot;
as he said he was risky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is operated and that they did . &quot;
if you do not do it spreads throughout .
it would have been a quite horrible situation .
it changes a little bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could start what the interruption had to be a minimum , if that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
that is how it starts .
the ruin itself is already a challenge but that makes it even bigger .
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ing morning to talk something more than otherwise and therefore tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; st@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Ar@@ till@@ ery Reg@@ im@@ ent in an operation in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; repeatedly just how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would have no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I could not have a better person for wearing or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race lost over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to let yourself be carried away .
&quot; we had a good start at the same time , and at the same time we were not looking to make something of Tol@@ les . &quot;
&quot; we did not want fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions on its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer for Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that was my last race .
that could have been too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am a Olympi@@ as . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; this feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years of exemplary for clarity of clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ a Group &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes into retirement . &quot;
the association is regarded as a &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far exemplary . &quot;
a small fresh water @-@ purpose association as a model for the great water producers .
it was thus some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in an article of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later the water forum was made by the government of sub @-@ Fran@@ ks .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ a Group held &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the use@@ able staff , of which 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
he was reti@@ re with retirement in the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association with seat in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , community lati@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; affiliates are the communities of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Broad@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city . &quot;
for further towns and municipalities there are water supply agreements .
&quot; the current President , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Stage ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 has been set as a water@@ front and was appointed as Managing Director of the Institute &apos;s Office since 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they have been extended by water@@ conduc@@ tion and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , the budget@@ ary position , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency st@@ akes at weekends , &quot; &quot; said the Chair@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , ground@@ breaking sales in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the acquisitions of water pipes . &quot;
there have been no down@@ time and you have resum@@ ed new features because water life led and drinking water is the most important food .
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart bloody for his water @-@ purpose association , and he has settled the water @-@ purpose association as if it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he used to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing Group at Nit@@ rat@@ ory group in front of the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
for this he got a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ worn on the one hand praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Greeks who have worked together with him 28 years .
he is the best water@@ case and he was a faithful bu@@ p .
together we were an unbeatable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re @-@ struc@@ turing of the use@@ fulness . &quot;
but the biggest challenge and the hard@@ est use were the pipe break@@ age at the flood at the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ yard on a 3rd January .
&quot; at minus 17 degrees , the whole night will work through , so that the localities could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one can only be maintained , because one filled the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt . &quot;
the board of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel storms from Lau@@ ter to turn the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

a 35 @-@ year old man has shot on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in an apartment house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ eide ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and they are fatal .
&quot; the man himself inv@@ oked himself with us and stated to have created his fellow @-@ mate , &quot; &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him I become public . &quot;
&quot; by now , nationwide , because S@@ ven S. could be traveling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,@@ 80 meters large , muscular , brown and has a gl@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is however a few years old .
&quot; meanwhile , the man bears a gl@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he can still carry the weapon with himself , so the police . &quot;
who sees S@@ ven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the victim was year 1988 , the perpet@@ rators of 1981 . &quot;
the responsible police in Lübeck first wanted no information to the Ta@@ ther@@ lin and the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but they confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a red@@ dish that is delicate . &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the kr@@ isen@@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in meg@@ acities .
&quot; financial stresses , that thre@@ aten the sector out of the oil production , are of the table . &quot;
&quot; it remain in the liberation from renewable energy sources in the components for the so @-@ called self @-@ generation in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ ag@@ over@@ s ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we were able to finally reach negotiations after two years ago .
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel manufacturer , the gases coming from the ho@@ cho@@ es for electricity generation for their own consumption , to ask for the checkout . &quot;
the steel industry supports additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association .
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there will now be a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with competitive commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel drives , all an EEG conver@@ gence of 20 percent . &quot;
but this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ stream production .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely fixed . &quot;
special meaning have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is the future &apos; is a first step . &quot;
&quot; you have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emission level , climate and employment targets are considering &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 under consideration and a significant price pressure .
&quot; last year , the situation intensified increasingly , when the world &apos;s largest Er@@ ger@@ land China was growing in light of the weak@@ est domestic demand of steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturer cast lots of Chinese steel crus@@ hed price dumping .
in the course of this spring the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; to the one hand , the mer@@ ges on import and effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects have moved up into China . &quot;
&quot; unclear is , how sustainable the price recovered . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p continued to be careful on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been st@@ agn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p did not want to close the lock@@ ings of individual plants .
&quot; in the German steel industry , some 8@@ 6000 people were busy at the end of 2015 . &quot;
in July the German steel manufacturer despite rising prices and increasing orders are cau@@ tious .
&quot; they produced more than 3.4 million tons in good six percent less raw steel than in the year @-@ year @-@ year , such as the economic cleaning of steel on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the amount asked now the second month .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the production is about two percent below the previous year &apos;s prior year . &quot;
the association expects in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing seniors well &quot;
&quot; the singing has done Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as young girls she was in school choir , in teaching studies , she won the com@@ partment of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old girl sings in an elderly choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; next door , she is doing something good at doing so doing her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; for S@@ ingen is equal to multiple perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior Bundes@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most of the seniors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; due to regular meetings , seniors can establish social contacts and maintain . &quot;
&quot; as often , social and familiar structures can be solved in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also has Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp made in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize themselves to others , and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
sing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense means H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so exercising a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; whoever demands his lungs regularly , but also in everyday life not as fast from the d@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; even though it is about getting the sound of the voice at age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the federal community of the elderly organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint vent@@ ures had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing of songs with older people raised many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and particularly melodies , man denied itself on a long time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the head will also require special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge .
&quot; especially older people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on yourself . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I have long for something , I will be better and alert over me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent to have , ig@@ t L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 Sin@@ ce people who h@@ ears there , once a sound goes next to it ? &quot;
looking for the right offer you have seniors different ways , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sing someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior ench@@ y@@ ma , you can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over choirs in the area .
who wants to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or church officers .
many volunteer choirs can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; who has no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet research . &quot;

cats react to sensitive as a ch@@ ater upon scre@@ w@@ arks of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover on what effect the ruin of cat@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals has .
&quot; to their surprise the mi@@ ch@@ ew also caused the males not cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression of cat@@ bab@@ ys at the mi@@ ys of the little ones .
&quot; they react to ten percent faster on sounds of kittens , who choose to have found themselves in great need , such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Medicine and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) . &quot;
C@@ ater also react to the ruins of kittens too - but always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ths of less and strongly er@@ ra@@ ining squ@@ abs for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
she is the first published in the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and sound @-@ height of the kittens with the ur@@ gency of their help is different . &quot;
all nine adult K@@ ater and eight kittens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
you were used for a rod of babies which were taken for three minutes from the throw box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were faced with scre@@ ams of stronger ca@@ vities which were additionally raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sampling for sow@@ ing vigor@@ ously .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not yet grown up , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned off faster to the loud@@ speaker when this sh@@ it played a very different kittens .
this ability may be potentially or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ ine . &quot;
scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men in the past several times in humans .
&quot; also , some studies showed that women are sensitive to inf@@ ants if they were already mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the other foot@@ ball@@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver was issued a arrest warran@@ t .
&quot; he will be thrown , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
for the first time after the coup attempt a major football match takes place in Turkey .
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ riv@@ ella between colon@@ iz@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as &quot; . &quot; is said .
&quot; already during the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the exp@@ ir@@ ation after the crash in July the government , the everyday life of norm@@ al@@ isations were not affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
it is also not acceptable before football .
against the former bar@@ ark@@ ov Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver turned the prosec@@ utor a arrest warran@@ t .
&quot; according to this , he is also thrown into South America in South America , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ ver is supposed to be tra@@ ded by the Prus@@ sians Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible by the President Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt .
&quot; in fact , the exceptional condition for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact it has no effect on the life of the most Turks but as good as no effects . &quot;
the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into fans and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs are traditionally not counted among the Friends of the President .
&quot; but what is the cru@@ de of the Turks , but in view of the dramatic experiences in history , the strict rejection of military coup . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats up for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sightseeing .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be especially returning to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his athle@@ tic value introduced the Köl@@ ner in the last season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first game time as a top@@ scor@@ er of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ ffer .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; rejo@@ iced : &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the podium .
&quot; thanks &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; the disap@@ point for the record was an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also appeared in the European League early . &quot;
in the addic@@ ted by Li@@ g it was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we have managed and this is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Pop@@ ulation the game was better .
&quot; above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who comes with 26 season in South Tyrol as a South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher , the basis of the 14th song . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year old .
&quot; in doing so , he had only announced the AC Florence under contract and announced to Colon@@ el &apos;s Gom@@ ez following the coup attempt to return for the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; k@@ icker &quot; &quot; clu@@ b@@ chief Fi@@ f@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to this , the storms would have to be ready to rel@@ inqu@@ ish about a third of its to 7.5 million euros estimated years , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; his salary in Florence , we cannot pay . &quot;
despite doping : these athletes have even medals for Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already imprison@@ ed twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
other over@@ led athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh it - they fight in Rio to medals .
the issue doping determines the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ m@@ s@@ in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had lod@@ ged their start@@ up shortly before playing at its start ( 100 meter chest ) mer@@ c@@ ess and distinctive . &quot;
it was a sk@@ il@@ ant scenario : with a set @-@ up smile she was still proud of the hall and had prov@@ oked it with her performance .
&quot; when festive that they will not get gold , the audience broke into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other athletes , who are going to start the start in spite of intelligence @-@ past during the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had been imprison@@ ed for two times ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell , the olymp@@ ic winner of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the greatest challenging of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time olymp@@ ic head and si@@ zable World Championship in 2010 had to sit down a six @-@ month lock , after you have proven the intake of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery you had strong gear , it def@@ ends the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the olymp@@ ic winner of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 to 2016 has been positively tested for the botan@@ ic stim@@ ul@@ ant funds meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic passed the wis@@ ely intake and was imprison@@ ed for six months .
the four most advanced throws this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ tre@@ k ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic olymp@@ ic and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was in 2010 positive tested and 21 months were locked . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible to ro@@ uted mer@@ ging .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old man over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ sti@@ le , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes were detected so many medals . &quot;
&quot; so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost its World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having observed testosterone doping . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the Bronze medal of the Olympic Games 2008 was given back to a certificate issued by the International Sports Court of Justice .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is on rank two of the world calendar .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km long , China ) : the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ ant and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but must still be launched in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 year old world mayor , references to taking a prescribed supplement was found , the lock of the world anti @-@ doping agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran already on July 13th . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Öster@@ rei@@ cher@@ in in@@ jured - Many T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ person of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ ag@@ early . &quot;
&quot; they suffered pl@@ ung@@ ed , and be treated in the hospital , but have already left it again . &quot;
it is scheduled for the beginning of September for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether the further explo@@ sions on the holidays island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe are also affected Austrian citizens , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , the State Department stand in constant contact with the local authorities , so snor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hua H@@ in had explo@@ ded two bom@@ bs on Thursday night . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , the police have been killed and about 20 people have been in@@ jured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three low@@ lands and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; Fri@@ day@@ early then went once again two jumps , and the authorities were killed a further human being . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bom@@ bing of bom@@ bs .
in the det@@ on@@ ation near the holiday resort popular Bad@@ est@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong was in@@ jured a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , then another bom@@ b , which was an urban starter . &quot;
the spr@@ int was to have gone into the air according to the authorities in a flower in front of the territory of the coast police .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g demanded to the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ phe on the south @-@ east coast , several wounded . &quot;
one go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in that was called it .
&quot; the bom@@ b attack carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said armies of the Dan@@ ai PER@@ meth@@ av@@ ee approved in front of journalists . &quot;
&quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels .
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ b attack Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the Thai police explained to the other hand , the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion or with the international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
one also calls it that the bom@@ bs were placed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have received legal references to im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - however they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; still unclear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police declared their officials throughout the country , security around major government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amusement districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always minor bom@@ b attacks , but they usually do not address the tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hua H@@ in is a palace , which was used over the years by Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; according to the nun@@ tum bom@@ b explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommended to perform the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high safety risks ( security level 3 ) pushed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary travels in these provinces are not required . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were un@@ successful a few days after a controversial referendum held by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
these dre@@ aming the military influence also in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to beat chaos , while the country toward stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , considers himself good to have the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not have succeeded in getting the military rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
&quot; in addition , nearly a year ago in Bangkok , an attack on a popular Hind@@ u @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; Iden@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; is in the Visi@@ er of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several national offices , even the Constitutional Court in the covenant have put the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; Iden@@ tit@@ ular movement &apos; clu@@ es for aspirations against the free democratic basic rules , &quot; said Constitutional Court , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the emig@@ rants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in the extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that is why we observe the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Iden@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; , &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Constitutional Court in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; &quot; Iden@@ tit@@ ular &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority is closely aligned with the offices . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Iden@@ tit@@ anic movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , extre@@ mi@@ sts are speaking with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ ed music . &quot;
&quot; Islam@@ ists , as well as the right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
this is not a false advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda should address the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are very sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , there had been reports from several federal states reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; Iden@@ tit@@ ular &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind will be relevant only from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist , their goal is changing and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is crucial if such people have tax@@ able influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the marked increase of legitimate criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee , he said Ma@@ ate , he would not speak again in this context yet again . &quot;
but we have observed in recent years that there can be right @-@ frozen structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the whole group .
&quot; it may be quite that further right @-@ wing group@@ ings or small groups formed , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps , or attacks from other far right @-@ right motives plan . &quot;
but a nationwide or European control of law@@ ns may not be identified .
the groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate d@@ ined about that many transi@@ tions went to the account of people who have not appeared before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the scene at attack on Asyl@@ um , have previously not been known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have thus committed criminal off@@ ences which were previously entitled with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which might have been politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which is then radical in the right @-@ right mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympi@@ ans or world @-@ cor@@ k head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold performance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer time in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ looked s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that it was no longer able to see in the TV pictures at times . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently to the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a return of 48 seconds ends his cycle and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 starter . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not an athle@@ tic figure , which attracted attention to the attention of the international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old are participating in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special starting point from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries .
&quot; since in ether , most sports@@ men wanted to go , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes itself ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ name made the lap .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L of the whale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; bene@@ factor &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made himself funny with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , because there was no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of medi@@ ale attention .
unforgettable was the performance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea @-@ Guinea when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of Fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ table was fired by M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the time 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business , each shareholder will eventually be rest@@ less . &quot;

the fees per cu@@ bic metres of wast@@ ew@@ ater from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ d@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of up to 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
&quot; at the time of the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will be later than once again increase when appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
after a over@@ l@@ acked calculation the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf then is at 4.@@ 37 Euro per cu@@ bic metres .
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser , ( CS@@ U ) reported it was found in the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat@@ ory Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems re@@ fr@@ ameworks . &quot;
the market Kas@@ endorf is committed to a legal basis responsible for operation of the facilities .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 the citizens and the commercial and industrial drives from Wel@@ th@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg deeper into the po@@ cket@@ book . &quot;
the ag@@ it@@ ating increased are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt the panel was shown , a re@@ calculation of fees for the se@@ wage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also Over@@ - and / or sub@@ covers from the previous calendar period .
&quot; the gra@@ vi@@ cious med@@ alli@@ sts increased by Schmidt that in all three se@@ wage systems , there are relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage of water , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution of distribution , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a considerable impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the se@@ wage was slightly declined in all three systems . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the current calculation period in all three plants , not least because of their age , san@@ itation and repair expendi@@ tures have declined in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ s , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical v@@ ents had to be exchanged due to a damage .
&quot; in the p@@ umping station Wel@@ th@@ ens , the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led up and in the pond land Lop@@ p had to be installed after nearly 20 years of operation the first Kl@@ är@@ cher , which provides an additional v@@ enting option to keep the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for this extraordinary expenses , the continued super@@ visor and maintenance costs were taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous period of calculation in 2011 / 2012 still clearly below the current level . &quot;
stone houses made clear that with the low se@@ wage in the three plants the expendi@@ tures for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; thereby , bund@@ led Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment in the se@@ wage systems over the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned systems will continue to be prec@@ arious after stone houses on the long period , especially since one could not extend the supply area of the wage @-@ purpose of Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal for these systems , because it is concerned about defic@@ it@@ ary facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria got up for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was based on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first about zero since October last year , as a positive 0.3 % . &quot;
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was € -@@ 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.3 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non alcoholic beverages ( 1.@@ 7 % ) ; transport ( 1,8 % ) ; transport ( 1,8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
the prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine lengths ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic drinks and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remains unchanged . &quot;
S@@ nap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature critici@@ zed
&quot; S@@ nap@@ chat says that this filters is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ tizing against breeds . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool it allows S@@ nap@@ chat about 150 million daily users , changing reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure , which could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are in@@ ton@@ ed , independent @-@ speed tools that generate over 30 million enhanced r@@ arities per day . &quot;
all ab@@ om@@ inations shall reach the public .
&quot; S@@ nap@@ chat filters have moved to criticism in the past , in which they were accused of that the App Black@@ face fo@@ erde or white skin as a beauti@@ full deal would be . &quot;
&quot; when this week proposed a filter to some users who gave them s@@ itz@@ büh@@ el , false teeth and uns@@ killed che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot;
they asked if this repeated controversy sur@@ rendered to a larger problem that the company has failed .
&quot; the news and the indi@@ gn@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after S@@ nap@@ chat , that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as hom@@ mage to Ani@@ me characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , which have experienced se@@ is@@ dis@@ m , rec@@ alled the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others reject the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose tactics were widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and eas@@ ingly uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the opposite position of a very contradic@@ tory Asian caric@@ ature and the filtering effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ned , but that the yel@@ lowing has been pulled into the deduc@@ tible extre@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; S@@ nap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride dra@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in end@@ less dense and integration process , of meeting spaces up to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
&quot; and S@@ nap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are in the matter of race as their older counterparts , could rather go out of that sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; when one of S@@ nap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , it is much more difficult that such matters remain un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 year old K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday decided Zh@@ u , who works as a product manager and engineering for medium , to delete their S@@ nap@@ chat account , others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in a set of medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that racial refer@@ ential Contro@@ ll@@ sen would reflect a lack of diver@@ gence among adju@@ sting practices at S@@ nap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and ended up their set with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ S@@ nap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese American Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what against it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the S@@ nap@@ chat largely un@@ answered un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its employees and points out its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , there are S@@ nap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently focused a personnel responsible for under@@ presenting population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said that she is closed her S@@ nap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder whether they need more user like us to say that that is not OK . &quot;
Military Direc@@ ted ISIS secrecy information , represents the Committee of Congress firm . &quot;
&quot; military @-@ union members of the United States Central Command modified revised information to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islam@@ ism in Iraq and Syria , when the actual states had allowed the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Com@@ publi@@ ci@@ er members of the Com@@ publi@@ ci@@ er , secret services , reported by great dis@@ content among Central Command Intelligence stan@@ aly@@ sts , reported as superi@@ ors of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence services , typically ordered by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ acids , signed regularly a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual states on site and were univers@@ ally positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; cited a newspaper articles . &quot;
&quot; what is happening at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering if bad analyses of our political leaders , Ken Cal@@ vert , re@@ publi@@ que member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com are up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report presents detailed permanent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama instructions given to change the reports , how analy@@ zing themselves exposed to the pressure from their laws , an optimised picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half year 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements from the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented . &quot;
&quot; for instance , a Cent@@ Com An@@ sel@@ ger announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , re@@ publi@@ que conventions of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the following reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force in life after them was noted that an@@ alysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings during the investigations .
further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway through the General Secretary of Defence in the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the news service sector published on Thursday their own findings which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created a over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of assessment assess@@ ments to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in Kom@@ mit@@ ry , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , known in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; refuse the publication of re@@ directed reports , &quot; war@@ med the mor@@ als of an@@ alysts and &apos; delivered a little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ ps and Democrats have passed on to have no evidence of an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts as regards a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August the New York Times reported by investigations by the Pentagon @-@ chief of the Pentagon , which were recorded according to complaints from Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts . &quot;
&quot; T. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ person of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the defence of Defence would not comment on reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general phenomenon is still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the message services and the Ministry of Defence will welcome a controversy of these important topics of national defence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; investig@@ ating impacts on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question , how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crises regions . &quot;
&quot; the cri@@ tique of the secret information on the Islamic State remember , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the then government was faced by George W. Bush on the recommendations of many an@@ alysts as regards the consequences of many an@@ alysts on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year the team asked to provide Mr. Hoo@@ ker after indicating government officials from the Islamic State against the State of the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these tent@@ ative refin@@ eries have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market .
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure because of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation with a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner of Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won the Americans with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I do not belong to the people who kept their gates in memory .
&quot; however , that knows them : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two within their group will gain six teams each of the first and second place . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will take a little longer out of the way that will lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising number by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London games on the last 12 places . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the USA &apos;s youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since it was not able to qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
&quot; in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham was a British , Trainer of the National Team , and thus began to turn the things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ places in London that we have now .
we have to tear the rod completely .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a return of the area .
&quot; India was gone without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am the game took her hands . &quot;
&quot; it led a Spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left f@@ lange , then moved to the center and lu@@ te the ball into the gate for the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a course .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &apos; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is also , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are being able to make themselves stable and non @-@ evident , a rapid rel@@ ell@@ ent between competition and endeavour . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning rod , who was calibr@@ ated from w@@ rist@@ y to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athl@@ ete for the tri@@ athl@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you cannot listen to the television , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue in the Coff@@ ee@@ ar , without having to hear about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ fr@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had to go C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is doing it for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could quite be sent under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time which would be available to Prime Time if he would have a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts , or even fairy . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the Olympic Fl@@ ame is not lit every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized : air@@ brush shooting , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo . &quot;
we will always have the chest swimming and may last for a long time .
&quot; but if I might be modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me direct the attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney his debut , it was the last 16 years so pointed out that many of the ones I had asked , did not know that it is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA had sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had a athletes , who made it up to the end . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline has a certain out@@ si@@ der char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the one for the Olympic Games sounds . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a sublime enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ ons tre@@ m@@ bling of his never to end ton@@ ing - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving that combines two sports that is essentially united .
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must land a number of falling moves ( turning , he@@ els and sal@@ tos ) before they land on your feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ad for execution , difficulty and &apos; time times . &quot;
&quot; branches of athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are compete in Rio to each other . &quot;
the common olymp@@ ic vector is straight .
&quot; medals hoped in their quest for gold further , faster , up and above , sometimes up to the destination , sometimes up and back down and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; you are hunting not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output wall , but in the television transmission also another height of the world : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the target @-@ oriented quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a audience to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I want to look at the chance to look at these games as something .
of this the trampoline offers an attraction .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ t , seemingly he@@ el@@ os like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then after down , then effortlessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dream@@ y , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualifi@@ ers and end@@ ings of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the Streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will beam the ends as part of a afternoon block at both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia &apos;s Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; when the raising of consciousness can only be reached by att@@ age and lenses of male athletes , like the male U.S. Tur@@ ner is recently determined according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its after air , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested in Ethiopia , Long a fo@@ e of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; prot@@ esters , the political changes in Ethiopia ask for violent resistance of the government . &quot;
witnesses say that thre@@ aten prot@@ ested during the clas@@ hes with the police in Sch@@ uss@@ el were killed .
is Ethiopia just going to come together ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the stabili@@ est countries of Africa , a solid fo@@ e of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in the last few months they sh@@ aken protests against the government the land and spread more and more areas .
last week thousands of people on the streets and slow@@ ed fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful to human rights organisations .
witnesses showed that polic@@ emen shot on zig un@@ armed prot@@ esters and red@@ dish .
&quot; moving videos about the protests , which presum@@ ably come from the last or beginning of this year , show how security men hit young people with sho@@ cks while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the leader of the UN Office for Human Rights is now calling for an out@@ going investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and in future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands at the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ulum back in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet and safe and clean .
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously stated the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , with dis@@ si@@ dents effective for silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or pushed into the expan@@ ses of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you push people supp@@ ress and these no other options have except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ien . &quot;
the entire youth are prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover everything from ground use up to the stran@@ gl@@ ehold coalition with respect to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a far @-@ critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions along the border with Eritrea ; a fight for this z@@ ack@@ ly , controversial line was asked in June hundreds of life . &quot;
an@@ alysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ ga@@ den that have been forced more or less in recent years to re@@ use tur@@ mo@@ il and re@@ ar@@ ming themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of im@@ bit@@ ing after years of before moving to Hin@@ ts under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first appears harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheap smartphones were becoming more and more common and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government supports access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still have to communicate via internet @-@ rehear@@ x@@ ies , which they hide where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave to that they gathered so to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since 1930 , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from orthop@@ e@@ dic@@ s mainly to Christian high @-@ countries , in politics and economy , while she had exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ lands areas . &quot;
but even this is changing straight .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that constitute approximately 6 percent of the population , which are dominant in the military , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebellion leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ ated disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; an@@ alysts say that he was particularly wast@@ ed in taking early signs of dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ ment and special commission@@ er to use , to process opponents and make them harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ sigh@@ ted reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of Nord@@ h@@ ull , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am coming from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security controlled by the Tig@@ ray Safety Services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia was expecting such a tur@@ mo@@ il , 2005 , after thousands of voting prot@@ ested apparently by the government apparently from the government and were then stolen . &quot;
&quot; while the following ra@@ ils were killed many prot@@ esters , even if there were less than in the last months , and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; developing experts praised the leaders of their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , like the new pend@@ ulum , as well as their measurable progress in poverty control . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ rac@@ ed in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic town , of Tig@@ ray @-@ guided shops and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is always practiced in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests of the USA and other Western allies into a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ ym excursions on the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently rus@@ hed to closed this base . &quot;
&quot; during the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his fo@@ e in an already vol@@ ati@@ le area collap@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin @-@ walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his statement Obama founded ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m .
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last controversy that surrounds its campaign , that his multi @-@ repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State of the Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
these clari@@ fications took new questions concerning the communication skills of the presidential system of the Re@@ public@@ ans whether it was able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public .
&quot; it also brings his compassion to take him during an un@@ event@@ ful phase in protection , in the peculi@@ ar position to declare statements which he could not meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the clear@@ ings at a voting event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp had returned to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intended to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had been created . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning , Mr. Tru@@ mp said , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help to weak@@ en the statement , that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the Republi@@ can presidential system did not know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism pr@@ un@@ ted on Mr. Tru@@ mp while he tries to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign because of falling impacts on economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton kept speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and that he found their talk boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought forward sar@@ cas@@ m to its defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism , as he said , the Russians were supposed to send Mrs. Clin@@ t emails , but later he said &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the linguistic limits to politics and then back to the need .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test , how certain messages can be taken from his fans as they arrive , and then possibly &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert per@@ tin , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of un@@ sharpen@@ ed the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted an even valuable sound , since its re@@ frac@@ tures have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was released on Friday , a guided tour with a big lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp are generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative utter@@ ances , he accused his critics frequently , his statements to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he has strengthened the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal collaborators into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says is legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s statements , whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in that sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her but@@ t@@ res@@ er , completely wrong and therefore it came to pass the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstre@@ am Re@@ public@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an outdoor mini@@ ster@@ ous , ISIS allowed themselves to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tru@@ mp put his attacks on the media and cast them off on each of his words and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he under@@ took the &quot; poor , j@@ ame@@ ful &quot; television experts , who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can not . &quot;
some of the Democrats may be sorry about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once pushed over the price from the market there is a café in Green@@ point back
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a compensated café in William@@ sburg , in which one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years for good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue are pushed away . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the verb , sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
native wor@@ ms it as last loss in a rainy city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ert wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap @-@ shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is , then it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a recovered Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar fashion atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ standing staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
&quot; as a client offered a client to provide money for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained much . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the excav@@ ator bought the same es@@ presso @-@ style model .
it even uses the same tor@@ ches out of the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu you can find sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are Gar@@ ni@@ ches like K@@ AP@@ ers and sau@@ oni@@ ons .
there are kingdoms of nature .
&quot; café serves no beer more , but there are fresh fruit juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months Rodri@@ guez , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ amped current of old master customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers also have been pushing through prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she was moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path to himself . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee ham , she said . &quot;
&quot; I realized that there was coffee and culture in the verb , which fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink again coffee , even if they ordered this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ender C@@ hai tea ordered , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered in@@ vari@@ ably always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual place , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez said that he does not have a pen@@ ll about it , that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business area . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to produce a special soap for verb with the cold coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go with her offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new client has translated the Polish menu and Rodri@@ guez , said that he decided to deliver them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has more advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold coffee in the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café has expanded to a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph WIT@@ T was master and said that he was destroyed in the ground than the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the Bet@@ ter of Lok@@ et and the Order got a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to sm@@ elled this , &quot; he said . &quot;
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as a gour@@ mets President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for sophisticated delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland waterfalls .
&quot; his menu on that day was a bit modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ ato Sau@@ ce , Pot@@ el@@ p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert a P@@ fl@@ au@@ men@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with other people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , how they should eat . &quot;
the married couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ian .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; your latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ em Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ O 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh c@@ utter with olive @-@ piece , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato p@@ ree and vegetable @-@ emission ate . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ por@@ ters are ordered , this found the pair of discussing the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ uss@@ ar , liver and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and slightly tri@@ pod that stre@@ amed the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e ir@@ ked .
&quot; it must have been in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; during the years prior to the Great Depression , the table was in a American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
cre@@ ws of women co@@ ined for male field workers and it became freshly baked Past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; records the ways to which the country turned out to be , no longer the sh@@ un@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new budget : mysterious foods such as lo@@ aves and barracks were re@@ visi@@ oned to stap@@ le food , the barracks , as coo@@ ks un@@ appe@@ ased ingredients to hide under a cre@@ am@@ y sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dr@@ y@@ dr@@ y@@ st .
&quot; meat , for many years the center of American cuisine was , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar mixtures have been tried , because a cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing satisfaction has priority to taste or even a healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the house recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , the budget@@ ary appliances , including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 , the eating habits of the country are attractive . &quot;
&quot; published their recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to be &quot; household police &quot; and the challenge to transform Pamp@@ e like cre@@ mi@@ y sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals to transform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a festival of historic delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm house in his kitchen , he pointed like the millions of millions of the world , which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental kitchen such as fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in a fast @-@ golden dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was splendid real@@ ism .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate him with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the candidate of a house@@ ke@@ eper caused no interest in flavours by Mrs Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought forth the boring meal in Washington but also one of the most hear@@ est . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food was rejected , as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the leg@@ acies is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science has been applied to foods . &quot;
the couple gave me better understood when writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the wast@@ age of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded itself , &quot; she made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind b@@ umps .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert that had prepared them home : the P@@ fl@@ au@@ men@@ ar , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that there was a commonly used trick , modest recipes was to be missed . &quot;
&quot; there was no s@@ laugh@@ ed cream , only pe@@ ppers , some fl@@ our , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone turned something against a spo@@ on into the pi@@ ds , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly enough it tasted not bad .
co@@ e thri@@ ve three times a follow @-@ up .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opp@@ ed Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed by bom@@ bs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save the lives .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old itself has died at a l@@ bom@@ b attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; White Hel@@ mets &quot; , &quot; a civil group , which was saved according to image newspaper so far less than 6@@ 0.000 people . &quot;
&quot; 2@@ 900 volunteers are putting their own lives in the game , to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war area . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil guard , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house dating back to the world , went to the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans on the shining symbol in the Gre@@ ys of war .
&quot; but as a hero he never seen himself , said according to the image : &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter have rejected four fac@@ tor@@ ment above the Alzheimer adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remains of the bom@@ b , so not children to play , &quot; cited the picture his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to take terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board ship
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland only get started with 150 years ago .
&quot; while the Greenland shar@@ k on the grounds of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is an average of just 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five meters long animal speeds up to 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be with this maximum speed . &quot;
but it seems to be a sponsor for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least a Greenland which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein by Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span , which means for verteb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the theory of evolution has been thought that Greenland become st@@ ony . &quot;
only l@@ acked the evidence .
&quot; Greenland are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sk@@ inn@@ y coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius they dive on the surface usually only in winter .
about the li@@ festyles of Greenland know researchers in accordance with little .
&quot; your time @-@ pent@@ ag@@ ulation measures them , when they set up six animals in front of the s@@ bergen six animals with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; loo@@ t make this sh@@ arks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had the j@@ aw of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly they chase for sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of ice cream , and are looking for car@@ c@@ asses , which are from higher water layers to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fisher@@ man between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long while the largest 5@@ 02 centimeters .
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method of the lens of sh@@ arks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ et is already created before the birth of sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are no longer re@@ done . &quot;
the two smallest Ha@@ ie had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s while nuclear weapons attempts to drag greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
&quot; in the length of third @-@ centimeters in length of third animal , the lens uses a small surplus to carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all major Greenland had a normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes in its lens with contrast to normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland shar@@ k an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 centimeters are even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland female only then grew up when they are longer than four metres , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age . &quot;
&quot; because one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timet@@ res probably rose on the threshold to sexually mature , and his age with 156 years was determined , there was obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
&quot; also , it is likely to be a world record for vor@@ tices . &quot;
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live especially in icy waters is not an accident .
&quot; even the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck at the neck , a 120 years old har@@ po@@ stage top was captured , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there is a lot of people living there . &quot;
so they mature later - and then slower .
&quot; in order to keep up in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal is heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
a very big animal was supposed to invest in a long life rather than a long life .
belly background in the double pack
&quot; with topics concerning building , the council has focused primarily on the recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief the panel adopted the communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently extended residential areas can start . &quot;
&quot; after the property of the land , par@@ cel@@ er@@ al and exclusive issues and the applications for measurement could be put forward , the sale of land in the residential areas of &quot; road route &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) to prospective buyers nothing more in the way . &quot;
the council is convinced that the cru@@ ising is equally important in the rural and peaceful residential community of Schön@@ au young families and touching seniors alike .
&quot; as it was meant , builders can sign up right now in the Town Hall , via the allocation of par@@ c@@ els will probably be advised in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to request further information on the settlement of further industrial enterprises , connected to the creation of jobs , he decided to change the council &apos;s municipal plan only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area under@@ age @-@ lar@@ n the commercial commercial area is extended by two plots towards the national road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city at the Main has the best chances of reloc@@ ated jobs and companies in Luxembourg in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Excellence financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum it is uncertain whether money dwell@@ ings will continue to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions in the entire EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; EU pass , it is now sufficient for them to approval in the UK . &quot;
this is just making use of big US @-@ banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to be abandoned .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; counts with 10000 new jobs on the Main , five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , united the responsibility of monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance coverage E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the organization for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg has a large fund sector , s@@ lic@@ ate , but also in Dublin as well as in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
&quot; furthermore , the town with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the mi@@ sts for first @-@ class commercial properties are also increased by 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the management consultancy Merc@@ er stand the city in place seven , Luxembourg to place 19 , Dublin on Square 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if the quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors . &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um the most important financial centre in Europe .
&quot; this also addresses the forces of forces : in London , according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives justification from the hep@@ atitis C Patent At@@ it with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. Department decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to the refund of the legal costs that you have emerged from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was freed from a compensation install@@ ment in the amount of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were covered in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicine S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , following an American judge a pattern of mis@@ behavior from Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ vers and other non @-@ ethical actions . &quot;
on request of the law@@ suit on Thursday said US @-@ minist@@ ation in Beth @-@ son Fre@@ eman that Gilead is entitled to let the costs have emerged during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to uni@@ fy with Gilead that can control the market of a new generation of hep@@ atitis C drugs which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck lasted each other and claimed to one another , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;
&quot; by the USA supported forces , they have again re@@ conquered full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; by the USA , troops supported the complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j close to the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left this , said a spokes@@ person of the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) per@@ plex@@ ed according to the excerpt of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city , currently the city . &quot;

Clin@@ ics earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal control
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton released their tax statement on Friday for 2015 , this resulted in the presidential did@@ atin of Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ ics USD 1 million went for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton than@@ ked an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ker &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his control elements of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards with regard to financial transparency , &quot; gave Clin@@ t Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ ass contradiction , Donald Tru@@ mp hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ e@@ ers with regards to his previous promises to publish its tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common to release US presidential data to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged to do so . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have as a reason for his ref@@ usal to establish a tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ ics electoral hel@@ hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to publication of the presidential did@@ atin of Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special advis@@ er to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential Empire of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already understood that his ref@@ usal questions concerning assets , his donations for charitable organisations , its business mines and various other connections have been established , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already passed on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet in which high @-@ level re@@ public@@ ans Tru@@ mp are calling for its tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject also during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he refused to do what every other presidential did@@ acy has done in recent decades and to publish its tax statements , &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a economic journalist of the New York Times announced on Friday a number of tax attorney and tax consultants who could still be the case . &quot;
governments have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would make that people earn more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a voting event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate here his seat , Tru@@ mp for a meeting in order to exchange their control . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ alo said , he was also subjected to tax examination of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ ics Camp@@ a@@ ign has released tax return to the year 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ ics , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective tax rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax statement of the Clin@@ ics of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income compared to wages , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main terrain was a cost @-@ effective index funds , from which the Clin@@ ics divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 negoti@@ ates . &quot;

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ g of fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ ph@@ ant protection
&quot; natur@@ alist in Tanzania use a orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants of it , in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation which had already been the idea for years ago , together with the US nature conservation , has intensified their promotion , to use volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania , a non @-@ violent quad@@ rup@@ ed method to protect their houses and harvest without hurt animals . &quot;
previously many speakers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the telephone number dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change of their attitude within these communities that they can hold much more confident that they can with@@ hold the eleph@@ ants out of their fields , without the eleph@@ ants to damage the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a communication . &quot;
the first two steps cover the illumin@@ ate of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bli@@ sters in a horn .
&quot; if he is not de@@ ported , a so called &quot; &quot; ch@@ ap clouds &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; Chi@@ li@@ ani@@ des blend with earth together with a fire@@ works co@@ il@@ form@@ ers in a con@@ dom , whose end up to the igni@@ tion only becomes rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom comes with a b@@ ang and spra@@ yed fine dust at Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ffs in the air . &quot;
a touch rather usually already out to chase the eleph@@ ants .
&quot; a last option represents an adverti@@ ser , which sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ works in the air and thereby causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin Hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed according to &quot; Arab &quot; request - RT News
&quot; a French film@@ maker with Jewish roots ent@@ ails a media watch , after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have any Israeli pre @-@ election as the Arab guests had requested according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; caused his ag@@ gra@@ vation in the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German magazine FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann tried Israel to find on the lands of the hotel .
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ah@@ si offers an opportunity to choose Israel over a private call center . &quot;
after an explanation the director turned to the reception .
&quot; the answer , which he received there , &quot; I saw him , &quot; how Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel commented that the measure will be a &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason that was behind it , redeemed in the director even more w@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; was quoted by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this is worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame .
this does not require any declaration .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
the incident redeemed a fairly large resonance on the internet in which people knew the whole sc@@ andal .
some ques@@ tioning the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it could have been given to the alleged requests of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; was it in a different post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel soon pointed all the accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident , &quot; &quot; seen &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel does not record into the quick@@ ening list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country @-@ election has now been added .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; rubber mig@@ ra@@ de against prot@@ ested Brazilian students
students come together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered together to demonstrate the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police put Tr@@ as@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ ra@@ de against the prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began , as the police tried to explore the students , which resulted in the police of rubber and dro@@ p@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals submitted by the Govern@@ ors of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , slightly less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants saw Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ bel against the provisional President Michel T@@ emer of walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred a few days after prot@@ esters in masses on the streets went to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dism@@ issed from the office by a v@@ ot@@ um of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade show between Moscow and Teheran in the year are equal to 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , shared the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies employ existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further commercial construction is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade deal between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent spr@@ ing@@ le and bet@@ s $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran climbed by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade down@@ turn was reached by deliveries of machinery , vessels and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan takes place for this year by a record of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , Russian reloc@@ ations were about 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily from Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , in Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran achieved the top 20 of the countries , as regards the number of companies in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record pay ir@@ onic tourists in Russia from last year , broken , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally , I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses sought : drink market in forest oil @-@ oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack is performed on Thursday night on the beverage market of RE@@ WE XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; taking on a shot of a bu@@ ck @-@ weapon called three dark dressed people who had caught their faces , from the employee of the drink c@@ ark@@ ed the publication of cash and then escaped at first and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was exploited , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators are to be between 1.@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters large , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the Park@@ deck of the RE@@ WE market and is bad in sight .
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ strasse , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert path and from which opposite the parking @-@ house car park with the silver @-@ far@@ ed car would be pl@@ ated , possibly in direction B 256 ( h@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made for the time ( against 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) observations , which are in connection with the pre@@ dat@@ ors , should get strongly in the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : a game and fun during the summer time
eight beautiful and wonderful days spent the children and young people of the social day group / social group work of the child protection of the Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer time in N@@ uss@@ dorf near Müh@@ l@@ acker .
&quot; in the quiet , open @-@ minded hard@@ woods , the life @-@ joyful group was included in the first school holiday @-@ week . &quot;
several full day trips were available on the program .
to one we went to Brittany with the visit of the Sp@@ el@@ z@@ oos .
&quot; on the other side by mouth @-@ bron@@ n , where there was a special child care in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .

&quot; further highlights of leisure activities were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of visit@@ ation , the sun and the children and young people returned home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the gate of Mer@@ cy
the Mini@@ ature from the Sou@@ p @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna was on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages have been accomplished .
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Roman@@ tics of all Mini@@ stries , the Ober@@ minist@@ erial round St. Anna was determined to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgri@@ m goals were checked and it was finally decided for the bish@@ ops of Freiburg , where he opened a special pilgrimage to this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy by the Open Day of Mer@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt rose up the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before the priest , the pilgri@@ m sent the pilgrims to a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and divided the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train to the run@@ point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster unknown woman stands and so the pilgrimage path from Münster was joined . &quot;
&quot; the individual day trips were shot in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with different shapes , songs and writing . &quot;
&quot; but also the way , the Min@@ is began to cross field cru@@ ising , chap@@ els or churches again and again , to sing a song from one of the pilgrims to sing together . &quot;
for the nights the parish of the local parish were at your disposal .
at the recep@@ tion@@ ist Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty and strengthened dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went over Fur@@ tw@@ ave to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags on this one took the stage to St. Peter , which was the hard@@ est path for@@ getting , but at the student heat first had to be climbed up around 500 metres and thereafter again . &quot;
the deserved reward was in the evening a common gri@@ lling on the beach .
after the dawn on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery of St. Peter it went to the closing cap to Freiburg .
&quot; clearly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is in the later afternoon at the Frei@@ burger Münster , and crossed the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse I was grateful to God here .
at the Abend@@ Fair in Münster were welcomed by the pilgrimage of Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the altar .
the next day was still time for the Bre@@ is@@ ure metropolis .
after the afternoon it went by train back to Hor@@ b .
in the end all the participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
&quot; sk@@ id Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ks home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling &quot;
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the male team Spr@@ int in the Vel@@ o@@ rom in Rio to glory , as the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the a role , which had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the J@@ ing and made the legend more proud when he stor@@ k after a victory from favorites New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six olymp@@ ic medals .
&quot; she reiter@@ ated the trick , after they took place in March at the World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver &apos;s Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement generated a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton trying to close . &quot;
Sk@@ inner was the man who remained with her when she saw the potential of the car@@ rots that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Kenn@@ y , Kenn@@ y - the first four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and sk@@ inner in the qualifi@@ es rounds , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ ds victorious the New Zealand , in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap was just under short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and sk@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a great part of the transformation , in which it was running in a higher gear to slow him and allow Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw its position as a BBC expert from his position and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they went on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ y comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make me a name .
in the En@@ dr@@ unde we have erected a olymp@@ ic record and conquered the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave it to that he was clearly visible after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such a super@@ normal victory , this time was not such a problem . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; It feels with the whole GB flags on the Tri@@ b@@ une such as London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
if that is a bar@@ ometer for our progress in the last five months we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
&quot; with the form of passwords , it is in the area of Pos@@ sible that he repeated the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( an apparently sacred date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a yields of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cheese of ho@@ y equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
&quot; it feels a bit lonely , alone to win . &quot;
&quot; saying , &quot; If he wins two further gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there were more good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dges Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race . &quot;
they came to the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the World Record , which was won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) today will take place on the second day of competition where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he was able to stand up yesterday with officers in front of the qualification as it turned out to measure his height .
&quot; at the corresponding women &apos;s contest , the morning continues and ended , Jo@@ anna Riv@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in World tre@@ k@@ ord@@ era in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB Team leaves to dominate his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a swe@@ ar of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were driven down . &quot;
&quot; Dr@@ amas was played in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex@@ ism and har@@ ass@@ ins , as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if you look at the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite as it could be the legendary call GB@@ s which at the perfect moment has reached its climax again . &quot;
future of the melt by Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract .
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs by workers - are on the game , since the system operator will announce the energy supply contract and thus supply all supply agreements , such as the supplier &apos;s energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria early this year , no further subsidies for operation of the plant . &quot;
a maximinum payout of payout is scheduled for a period of 20 years .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; not less than 2000 jobs , direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to Dom@@ ino@@ x because the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ tori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry mel@@ ting , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risky a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the installation . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ tdown with its Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared with it that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold small shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to operate the plant in Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt , shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L said furthermore , that the Treaties will have so called &quot; &quot; backup stores &quot; &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; from therefore , AG@@ L goes out that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong deadlines for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L told that it has already written the value of the Treaties in the amount of $ 187 million in the expectation of a cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make up the contracts , the &apos; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... the melt to operate or supply the power supply to the melt . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year @-@ contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still a statement of it , why it came back from the contract . &quot;
an@@ alysts warn of the bad economic relationships of the industry before the possible closure of the port of Port@@ land in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex in the vicinity of New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the an@@ alysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 me@@ ga@@ watts and tom@@ ago approximately 900 me@@ ga@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , that would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; with a view to the September @-@ edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Cardinal has begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls Big Si@@ ster Kim likes to see what the Vo@@ gue Cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September @-@ edition is for Vo@@ gue which usually will be the most vulnerable edition of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , which resembles rather a picture band as a fashion script , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is anticipated so worth not@@ ing that over the last two years the magazine is still le@@ ased prior to the official announcement .
&quot; women who have already been on the cover cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ rities , the Mod@@ els &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els , &quot; the celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ Prei@@ str@@ ate and conductor Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or Reality stars or young people today who know how to set a good s@@ nap@@ chat video ( even if it does not apply to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who are interested in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade was one of the most successful years of their career .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like it to everyone . &quot;
with their Reality @-@ TV story J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something tense .
in June the iconic Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the Mi@@ st@@ ings of Oph@@ thalm@@ cks . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ined again high when the message with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the mis@@ ut ride seems to go round at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
they sold by her made pictures from C@@ indy Craw@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
and in their free time it is to be seen in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; municipal centres point in 16@@ 0.000 people annually , &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the aid of the country are rejected annually by the municipal centres centres , while the industry is based on the effects of other medium cuts in already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just delay and similar problems - are rejected on free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already out@@ dated , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , these legal centers will be further 30 percent of their federal agents . &quot;
&quot; the director of the municipal school centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Federation of Community institutions have revealed that already thousands of people be rejected each year . &quot;
&quot; Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without the abolition of the decision of the federal government .
&quot; Queens@@ lands community centers centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with uns@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have problems of a legal manner and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut down by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means thousands of helpl@@ ess people from Queensland , with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we demand the General Assembly and the Minister of Justice George Bran@@ dis , as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to get up these medi@@ ates immediately , so that people can get the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provincial government filled their commitments to lift funds for guidance on national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customer communities , as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are considerable losses for government party SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; this is representative representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black Government co @-@ operation in the north could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after re@@ frac@@ tures in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party but would have good chances to continue to face the government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD is increased by 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party stands still just under the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ d .
&quot; the left wing was put on 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ d would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; in spite of light losses , the Gre@@ ens were able to deal with 6 percent ( above 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in the heav@@ y@@ land of land . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by three percent in each country .
&quot; according to the German Chamber of dep@@ uty , the SPD of the survey follows only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28@@ ,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 percent .
&quot; they with@@ stand behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but above the left with 15 percent ( formerly 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ d would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the dep@@ u@@ ties of the dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return , the pirates in contrast would miss the objection in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device wo@@ g almost half a kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite a kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight me@@ gab@@ ytes , which would range today for about two sel@@ f@@ ates with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ yte
&quot; the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator came just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , to the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers of equipment can still buy on the Internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the era . &quot;
&quot; however , 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months previously at the CeBIT trade fair in Hanover in the west @-@ format format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax was the Communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to websites was possible by HTML browsers , even if agon@@ izing slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black and white screen found .
&quot; the price was quite proud of the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was at 3@@ 92 Euro .
nobody was able to imagine that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the clever phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the cell division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and executed . &quot;
the market today master providers that all came much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there have been almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; approximately 1,4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple , alone 5@@ 55 million pieces . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is about 400 billion euros .
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies come . &quot;
around the smartphone has now developed a whole industry .
&quot; the key breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple Chef Steve Jobs launched the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , all accessible via touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the triumph of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , which dominated the market , had the watch . &quot;
&quot; finally they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
&quot; the smartphone is 20 years after its invention , a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; in the inc@@ ision , each German now looks for 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we have to learn all , the smartphone also set out , &quot; said Mr Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens @-@ board for staff . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring in our local municipalities and all over London , but in all the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ then , just like back then in 2012 in London , when we operated a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; and these will be reached again by creating new possibilities for or@@ ts@@ , and companies near He@@ a@@ throw new possibilities . &quot;
&quot; for our local communities we will already create 10,000 new teachers , create 40@@ ,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , it will be such that will think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ so is too big . &quot;
&quot; I said that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will be blin@@ ded on the world stage . &quot;
the doub@@ ters were wrong 2012 and they will be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcoming but He@@ a@@ throw answers any questions asked .
how the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in we@@ ather@@ ed growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in order to leave the airport as well as in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion &apos;s Infra@@ structure investment programme in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal was built up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequented tre@@ aches of the world . &quot;
&quot; now , they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s London games were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
&quot; it is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , to which England can be proud of . &quot;

&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block signs on his desktop , published Ad@@ block Plus one B@@ log@@ post , in which it rus@@ hed that users can update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday shared Facebook with that his desktop page would change the co@@ ding page with regard to his advertisements , in order to make it inst@@ ant@@ ing the recognition of which part of the site advertising is to det@@ er . &quot;
&quot; however , Ad@@ block proclaimed that it has found a new way to handle new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blo@@ gger , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle is underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left for social media in the fight , is a strong indication of how worrying adverti@@ sers has become the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted from the last year of Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people , adverti@@ sers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , who access Facebook via their mobile devices , makes hand @-@ up 84 percent of advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; the company has set it on adverti@@ sers on desktop PCs , because mobile adverti@@ sers does not have any effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook will see the investment of such a stri@@ de as rewarding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad cour@@ tro@@ om &quot; &quot; to get more control over it on them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be worrying , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , shared a speaker from Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad recorder are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with suspected su@@ icide on Swiss motorway exit
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the motorway .
&quot; the police calls witnesses , after a woman in the early morning arrived on Thursday with a suspected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 in the Canton of Morges in the Canton of Vau@@ d on short after midnight .
&quot; a woman slept in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police in Vau@@ d said . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a silence at the age of 49 years , which was handed over by several vehicles , including a load @-@ car , who wanted to kill themselves . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police who calls them these as well as any witnesses to the incident . &quot;
&quot; it became a investigation process opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gill@@ es Hof@@ st@@ etter dem Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash cur@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not to be held accountable .
in each of the two cases where a person in the dark was running on the highway - was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian middle of the night running on the motorway as it was in the newspaper .
&quot; last year , a polic@@ eman of neg@@ ligent killing was acqu@@ itted after having crossed a man and had killed , who was at the A1 in August 2014 at the A1 in the proximity of Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk and has been unconscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the Court stated that the police officers , who had responded to a call -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely exceptional and un@@ predictable situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should register at the police number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine if Venus with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once re@@ filled similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their tight atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , d@@ ull atmosphere and nevertheless slowly progres@@ ses . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de earth , but had once enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accomo@@ date life and protect against rapid dis@@ armament . &quot;
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent of Zermatt .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation expon@@ ents the slow turn of Venus expon@@ ents its daily page of the Sun almost two months long , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which affects the surface from a large part of the sun heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average @-@ temperatures , which are some degree of cooler than the Earth today . &quot;
this model brought forth a story of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected of planetary research .
&quot; although it was once thought to be inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several hundred billion years was exposed to much heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light . &quot;
her oceans di@@ gest@@ ed and their water vap@@ or was blow@@ n away from the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
&quot; as its hydro@@ gen , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate @-@ amo@@ d@@ ells in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

&quot; over the course of the summer , I have thought much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this is needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision has to be perfectly adapted to the organization &apos;s vision and vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations . &quot;

&quot; the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars in the star amount to different ro@@ asting and in what regard the rotation @-@ time rooms are related to the planetary origins . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through the comparing of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star of P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this constellation that emerged from around 125 million years ago , now they reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
you are now turning on the fastest .
at peak rates the col@@ ou@@ ting stars encounter large amounts of ast@@ eri@@ des .
&quot; because this winch travel through the magnetic fields of stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star alter@@ nat@@ ured , its rotation @-@ rate begins to slow . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each of the star by det@@ ects the time between the appearance of a recognizable stars -- such as sun@@ fl@@ ectors -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars are turning more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars to turn more slowly pi@@ rou@@ x than a smaller one . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Bal@@ let &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be , very light stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the constellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the constellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how the How , W@@ ann and why stars de@@ cel@@ es their rotary rates and so to say their &quot; dance gloves . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper articles in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs
the tears fly with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball @-@ Star in the best days of Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old professionals will take place on the 12th of August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the jer@@ sey to his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to the &apos; , the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ Game of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
three times Rodri@@ guez became the most valuable player of the League in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature of a tenth year deal have been awarded him a year 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the extraction on 31 December 2017 , he serves as a consultant and a teen@@ ager - at full salary . &quot;
as a player it paid Rodri@@ guez long time with power .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
with the Hall of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two other bas@@ eball @-@ players in the most important statistics similar values .
&quot; however , in the rest of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be recorded . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; - on the field was , so disp@@ uted his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star was launched at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
in August 2013 he was locked due to a winding in the so called Bio@@ chemical sc@@ andal up to the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered a main susp@@ icious day to have received funding over an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time south . &quot;
also his f@@ arewell days did not go straight away .
as many bas@@ eball legends in their last play once again got the big stage Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench frequently .
&quot; my job does not include f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; ätz@@ te Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relationships with pop @-@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson re@@ said , sympathy acquain@@ t@@ ances of the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch@@ riv@@ ella Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , the p@@ endant at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first di@@ op@@ ing@@ es &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ test , weight @-@ the@@ a@@ Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio cannot start . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
an inherited Ath@@ eni@@ ans would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competitions , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ the@@ a@@ Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the most discern@@ ed athle@@ tics competitions this news is going to un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en has been proven the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ tic agent for dop@@ ing@@ spaces . &quot;
the International Sport@@ al@@ shof CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time exp@@ ulsion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old place had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the proceedings about 50 m Fre@@ est@@ l . &quot;
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) at the International Olympic Committee .
&quot; the national association take the matter &apos; very seriously and requires a full cooperation in the studies , &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua &quot; &quot; of a communication : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ al@@ shof CAS and will accept the ver@@ dict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases is responsible . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio oo@@ ed the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old and thus went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics section . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the substance is expected to act with the EP@@ T@@ EP@@ O blood @-@ offering . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was not suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B rehear@@ sal is also positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w settled immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ lon &apos;s Word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all weights from the chron@@ ically @-@ driven nation must not be part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; , &quot; the London Olympi@@ ad winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested as well as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before positive to the an@@ abo@@ le ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both are riding the intake , but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athle@@ tics , the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is a further heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF had banned the complete Russian team to an exception due to systematic di@@ op@@ ings the start , even the L@@ ill@@ nation Kenya produced in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the earlier attempts were taken care of in China for fierce conflicts between the athletes . &quot;
thus the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t was the Chinese olymp@@ ic winner Sun Yang har@@ p .
&quot; sun , Yang p@@ ink@@ dic@@ li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m , I want to pass on , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio . &quot;
sun was also the centre of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for mental sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested in the Chinese master Championships on the stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had only to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
data @-@ c@@ ł@@ aw : so per@@ fi@@ de @-@ presses h@@ acker her ran@@ som
programmers of compres@@ sors are currently targeted companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a current survey of m@@ alware @-@ defense specialists at 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies have been at least once , partially several victims of an attack with pres@@ t@@ us@@ sion@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , barely 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims are will@@ ingly prepared by the perpet@@ rators demanded of the perpet@@ rators to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators are specialized in black@@ ma@@ ze software according to the observations from Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes with attack on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially pressing ran@@ som falls clearly higher than for private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of harm software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the pa@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still being designed to send advertising . &quot;
then we discovered the perpet@@ rators of receiving software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ acking occurred within the past months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware operates after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , she searches for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; afterwards , the software presents the demands of the press . &quot;
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ ting Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users use the personal photo database on the game , it &apos;s about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies highlighted sales loss due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent , even the business operations had to completely inter@@ rupt , in case of a case people were fasting . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by loss of hospitals . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pays not , it promotes just the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , will get their data back . &quot;
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in operation .
the h@@ ackers again know that and try to establish a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researcher from F @-@ Secure reserves the user &apos;s use@@ fulness and contact with the researchers and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators actually try to take a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain to their victims by chat as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , do free @-@ accessible support websites or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and will receive private people after payments of a few hundred billion euros , companies need to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to redeem their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ kl@@ ess gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware , the h@@ ackers are always professional and share the work , explained security experts Chester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within one week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , it is that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their contam@@ in@@ ants then in the form of a software construction to the actual black@@ smith .
&quot; the previous m@@ alware kits were created by m@@ alware themselves , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the package includes a adap@@ tion tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ ers then seek further h@@ ackers to spread the newly created software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so , one logs in one of the forums in the underground , purchases the set of a crime and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per in@@ fi@@ able calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then bear sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies which make their data better .
over 50 percent of the companies @-@ companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey will trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware able to withdraw from file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful testing , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as customer @-@ lists or pricing , explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this is the potential for damages , depending on the type of data is still higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators could also be able to take completely new goals on the Internet of Things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , as they were able to receive a thermo@@ stat with the Internet &quot; thermo@@ stat &quot; under its control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the de@@ activation of such a non @-@ blocked heating could definitely be a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ r@@ ator then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production street in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday life @-@ proof
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda , Honda will do everything : a little s@@ UV , a little cou@@ p@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space for both in the first row and in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit upper side falls down there . &quot;
versatile vehicles is the HR @-@ V at storage box .
&quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ placed and 10@@ 26 l with enclosed back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , than it sounds : the seat areas of the back bank can be divided up like chin @-@ up and thus offer storage space , which is up from the floor up to the ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk zone can be loaded well , however the charging height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of speed ranges .
&quot; however , it is likely to do a bit qui@@ eter . &quot;
we are pleased to welcome the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another sco@@ oters : one 1.5 @-@ l @-@ gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; the equipment is not open to the top &quot; Executive &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; . &quot;
&quot; the security systems belongs to the city @-@ not@@ e@@ king assist@@ ent ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions @-@ system and the donation assistant . &quot;

&quot; but full connectivity is only available for top @-@ features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack are under arm@@ rest and therefore are a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much will receive the gas@@ oline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro . &quot;

Air@@ line is not liable : fall on air bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; a liability is conceivable only for dangers which are typical of air traffic , argu@@ ed the Supreme Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken up a knee injury .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the judgment . &quot;
the airline had no damages to the man .
disease case : when paid the organizer
dise@@ ased vac@@ ation@@ ers received only money after their journey when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less free in the hotel .
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case , a family on the second day of their turquoise were difficult to diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting . &quot;
it spent almost all the holidays in the room .
your illness led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective se@@ wage situation which supposedly had poll@@ uted the sea water .
&quot; the family was the view , the trip would have been insufficient - and mour@@ ned against the organis@@ er . &quot;
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the se@@ wage in fact was defective .
but the organizer just took just before the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his information , so the ver@@ dict . &quot;
especially in the samples of water no contam@@ in@@ ants have been found .
the disorder of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ ably through infection with each other - belonging to the general attitude of life .
there were only 38 guests at the age of 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; De Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence caused by the refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state would have n@@ uns and decided to react at the same time to terror .
safe : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and spl@@ itting .
&quot; this triumph , we will not treat the terrorists . &quot;
&quot; if offen@@ ders had to leave the country faster , but above all , the security and strength is also the approval of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personal strengthening of the security forces , and indeed &quot; in medium @-@ four sizes over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be back under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon law is to be re@@ trac@@ ed so that especially the purchase of weapons on the internet is worth it . &quot;
the last much discussed silence @-@ light for doctors should remain maintained after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the doctors , as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view about mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds better social care necessary . &quot;
teachers would need to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
&quot; to the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of covers . &quot;
&quot; SPD CEO Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior was clear against shareholders .
&quot; this was a ear for the Shar@@ u@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and abol@@ ish the double nationality .
a general prohibition of the entirety of whol@@ eness he kept for constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; one cannot prohi@@ bit everything you can reject , and I rest to wearing the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses against judgment .
green @-@ chief in Simone Peter threw the Minister before he wants to sim@@ ulate over new anti @-@ terror packages and action .
&quot; said Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Sp@@ ri@@ che and a sharpen@@ ing of the residence right bring people in this country no longer security . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it looks regularly on the move @-@ road - here a picture of November .
but that should change : the dispute should be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all the cars , who stand in the traffic traffic on the surrounding road every night in St@@ au , when they drive over the highway of Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the company &apos;s road building extends to the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the departure Wes@@ eler street , the legal ab@@ out@@ circuit takes about 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then go directly from the hammer road on the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic shares early , thus increasing the total duration on the multi @-@ driven section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the train station on the Zu@@ br@@ inger turns out the drivers in front of everything between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the re@@ st@@ au goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping route and sometimes beyond . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the needle , on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler Street . &quot;
from here the traffic will only be pointed out via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be trac@@ ed off well in a couple of years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had yiel@@ ded that the bridge has no longer the required load @-@ power , in order to accommodate the heavy traffic @-@ bil@@ ing@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related ver@@ sive St@@ au will not be able to say , the competent authorities can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , to be reck@@ oned with years : for the bridge has an official rest duration up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal dispute , the provincial company deliberately picked the traffic @-@ weak time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic will be carried out on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre now plan a musical project .
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s Association enables young people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster .
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ ima &apos;s initiated &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; visited 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years the st@@ aging in the small house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the aim of visiting the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee interests , schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and have little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the choreo@@ graphies , the scen@@ ical pictures and video anim@@ ations would have been possible to follow the action of course , so the press release of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wes@@ ter@@ berg from Spra@@ ust , and the young theater will work in the coming season as part of a musical the@@ atri@@ cal project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without fluid and migration background between 14 and 20 years can get the opportunity to visit professional instruc@@ tive courses in the fields of voc@@ als , dance , acting and music . &quot;
opportunities for children and families in the area of the@@ atri@@ cal play and the@@ atri@@ al voice exchange are available in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; goes on .
&quot; given the increasing refugee numbers , the association with many classes , who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star@@ ry : hope for weather repair
the weather has made the star @-@ star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany during the night to Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad because of clouds and rain bad for this , the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle to watch , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will surely see lots of star d@@ olls in the sky . &quot;
&quot; star@@ g@@ ings are Per@@ sei@@ den , which belong with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest clusters . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening you can sit etern@@ ally , at night it is far from the wake @-@ up . in the morning , it is far from the W@@ eck@@ er@@ kl@@ ing@@ ling no longer to think about sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one with such problems is in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleeping disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of ins@@ om@@ nia , and there are many causes underlying to them , stresses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ met , executive committee of the German Society for sleeping research and sleeping medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands it is , but the In@@ som@@ never , therefore , is an input and trans@@ verse @-@ disorder . &quot;
&quot; right now , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , board member of the German Haus@@ physician association with practice in lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of ins@@ om@@ nia are complex .
&quot; behind it can organic , mental or tolerated factors , but also medicines are stuck . &quot;
not rarely is the sle@@ e@@ disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early w@@ aking up is common especially during a depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it may be that different factors would like to meet each other .
&quot; who , for instance , has a band ex@@ cre@@ tion , can be bad , watch every two to three hours , and bl@@ ur@@ ably begin to sal@@ ute through everyday problems and worry , there is an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you be with sleep @-@ distur@@ ban@@ ces to a doctor ?
&quot; who has not sleeps over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , and the day is imp@@ aired , should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can be quite different : it is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily char@@ geable , has sing@@ ular fluctu@@ ations or bodily ail@@ ments like gast@@ ric or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve the sleep , it is important to figure their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options , inter @-@ treatment options , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medications - classic sleeping tables only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ frequent . &quot;
&quot; rainf@@ all , in Germany there are hardly any , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary dormitory of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should first turn to the doctor &apos;s problem at first , betra@@ y We@@ ar . &quot;
the problem can be clari@@ fied with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; for study in sleeping laboratory medicine : medicine , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing difficulties , in case of sle@@ ep@@ ist@@ ers or if you cannot find the cause of a sle@@ e@@ ability , explains fi@@ etze . &quot;
there is no need to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make lunch , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the wiring one goes to his normal time into the bed .
&quot; beside the electrodes in the body you can bear a nose , a chest strap and a antenn@@ as at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is also a camera on the ceiling . &quot;
how can you get the problems with the handle ?
there are quite a few actu@@ ators where you can bet for a better sleep .
&quot; we@@ es counts on : regular bed@@ - and ste@@ al times , not too long in bed , not to sleep in bed , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and at night doesn &apos;t start to watch at the clock - then you start to count immediately , and this is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler expressed himself on Facebook to the closing of the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the Short World Championships in Doha and presented at the same time his first world record . &quot;
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler communicated by Facebook to his or her criticism of the ex @-@ team @-@ team .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ asi@@ an 20,000 € bonus gets and a j@@ unk son of 150@@ ,000 € should not be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night to Friday on his facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ veying system in swimming @-@ sports is bad , the d@@ op@@ ing@@ controls , however , very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that do not promote a lot and do not operate so closely on the issue or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls should be set , &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , would have to have reported D@@ ei@@ bler already nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Doping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent Contro@@ ll@@ ers of W@@ ada / fin@@ a , must not take part &quot; , &quot; calls for the choice of Hamburg , who has now operates a ice cream . &quot;
airport : arrested Ban@@ de by Bag@@ di@@ eben
professional Di@@ ving at Düsseldorf Airport
civilian persons of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded in favour of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ icious ones had been committed as Ban@@ de multiple hand@@ ker@@ - and baggage buff@@ ers .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 p.m. civilian officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf , a gang again known to the polic@@ emen of past theft . &quot;
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the mid @-@ July of this year and were very professional and very professional .
&quot; the specialists of criminal off@@ ari@@ ate 34 can have travelled the th@@ iev@@ es , which were in@@ scri@@ bed to Germany and have travelled to Germany four acts . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they took a total of more than 15@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; alt@@ ars , a few lime trees , joined in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in at first sight , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walk along the road from east to west , one gets along the play@@ grounds , a fresh@@ est kinder@@ garten and a be@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the facade of a gray house has someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; spar@@ se .
&quot; opposite a li@@ d@@ l , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new flats . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the competent property company of Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in calls , in the last few weeks , however , preferred with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the house is occupied with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the inhabitants of the lease , on the ground floor are still open spaces and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year the Berlin cour@@ se@@ ator H@@ enk@@ el had repeatedly called for a tough action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting @-@ point autonomous force . &quot;
&quot; after on 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ wro@@ ede , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolled the police three weeks of official statements , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams , left un@@ locked parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile construction workers on behalf of the unknown house owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Board of Directors decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and builders moved under the jubil@@ ee of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road is peaceful : parents are going to walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others soci@@ alizing . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; lef@@ tist force is not the main attraction of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has lived in the pin@@ z , and Jan@@ a * , which attracts here three children , above all from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the household , they share the concern of rising mi@@ sts and Gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a pine , who wor@@ shi@@ el@@ ty pol@@ ishing protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which of the Berlin cour@@ se@@ ator , and the police between land@@ lords and their neighbors , does not exist as evi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in in East Berlin was a traditional working district , which is also a lower part of the city in comparison to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; domestic projects and domestic projects have been part of the Kie@@ z : 1990 , numerous homes were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was cleared under great police battle in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ aic and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly the magnet for tourists and El@@ ber@@ liner from around the world : with them the inhabitants of the GDR @-@ times and former household , he settled their p@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; this also makes itself noticeable in the rental , which since 2009 has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the ri@@ gs are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes it on the advertis@@ ed discs or newly created facades that were be@@ amed with dy@@ es .
no other road was so often mentioned along with the words of &quot; lef@@ tist force . &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neighbours might be seen as a problem , that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : criminal off@@ ences including bodily injury , according to statistics , according to polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most important part of the criminal off@@ ences make goods damage , which tends to meet rather the new@@ builds and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been living for Ker@@ stin , who has been living in a rental house since 17 years , in addition to the controversial 94 , can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined . &quot;
even the famous burning cars will give it right away in the ri@@ ver@@ er no longer .
&quot; for the architect &apos;s architect , their road is not a crime point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than somewhere else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately moved to the ri@@ gging street - and remained intact .
&quot; for that reason , it was also so important that local residents get back their road : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly had the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : through spot@@ light new buildings in former buildings which are pushing the old residents . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - here rather people , who are not so well be@@ amed , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not ignore . &quot;
but what should you do if one never list@@ ens to someone ?
there is frustration on all sides even in the police and the occup@@ ants .
&quot; for those drawn carriage , Ker@@ stin has little understanding of colour bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin has little understanding : the household projects and the left scene belonged to the p@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; who runs out should be aware - just like someone who runs into a pub , can complain about noise . &quot;
all persons named with first names have asked to be called by their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in the matter of integration and organizer .
&quot; furthermore , she is a social worker on site . &quot;
since July is Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gical supports the team of administration by Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact person for all players : refugees , labour and refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else could mis@@ lead . &quot;
&quot; a customer of the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le now is , the ei@@ ving W@@ oll@@ us@@ sau , which is above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less pointed than rather on the variety of desired fields , meant as the administration wanted to write . &quot;
&quot; searched for a management of management with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , such an en@@ gros@@ sing w@@ oll@@ us@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; yet , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organizing work , working with local people and behind the scenes as well as networks . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for approximately six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le ehr@@ er and general actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and racial problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the washing @-@ street
&quot; a serious problem , it has been recognized for some time , apartments for the connecting @-@ lines that have been recognized . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
you must accomo@@ date the refugees in their own or rented housing spaces .
&quot; the cost of construction , rent or refurb@@ ishment of these accommodations must be the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rat@@ ory to the Commune and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto the administration finds no private apartments .
&quot; it has not been working so far so far , be dependent on private apartments , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , non @-@ governmental apartments must be rented as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing @-@ street .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a firm cap , there are internship places , training courses , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and export activities for refugees and migrants that have to be tiled or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do charitable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very tidy , as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that working for the community to conduct a positive effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; not a employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activity does not mean work .
&quot; the day need a solid structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
the people would have to develop a vo@@ i@@ ority .
&quot; so there are offers like sport , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are shaved .
so you also jump here administration and volunte@@ ered .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the process is a problem .
&quot; you must explain the refugees that it just takes , and they can bridge the time necessary to bridge , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually make sense , it could not help in Ur@@ bach anyone who might not work and be useless , he will never integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; however , there is also , says customer honest , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two after the recent years are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher may call &quot; . &quot; a rest risk can and does not want to exclude them . &quot;
&quot; however , the hel@@ pers are already sensitive . &quot;
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they could have the fear that the attacks they bring them completely to call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main - and volunte@@ ering must be held on the ground and in the region after activities . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clear , shy the policy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place it hel@@ pers on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we would like to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would be the location to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that Ur@@ bacher are already very busy to integrate the previous human beings .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , one must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Schor@@ n@@ dorf : intru@@ der looking for helicopter
the police helicopter flew for about an hour of different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are rated on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 clock in an apartment in an apartment house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants of the inhabitants struck the two and hit the un@@ hol@@ dings into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters large , probably mas@@ hed , carried out both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ schw@@ lis . &quot;
you walk to the city center .
&quot; to the F@@ ahn@@ ision , the police put several stri@@ ps as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the F@@ ahn@@ ision ran without success .
perhaps the unknown before the fact was close to the apartment or at their flight .
