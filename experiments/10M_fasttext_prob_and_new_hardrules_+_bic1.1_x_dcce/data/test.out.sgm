<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">To invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"unone, the two US presidential elections are however in tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to punish the economy to death and regulate death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, it would be completely different, has claimed Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will break the regulations massively, and he makes himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax sets - for private professionals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, Clinton says: the state has specific tasks to meet, he has disadvantaged chances and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes for the rich would increase, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost wortequal."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teachee-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Trump you could find even more party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build carbon power plants and resume the cohesion of coal in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil Promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton and Clinton wants to expand and demand renewable energies with its investment program: "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpose-fish trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them want to isolate the USA from international trade, but simply want to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be, then he says, he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump is that the economy and citizens want to relieve the growth to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold him before, so that the budget deficit would only be bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"at the other side Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is one of women who fled alone, almost to everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen sit four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed their little son in the arms.</seg>

<seg id="11">It smiles short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the business manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria, and deals with the topic women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fled.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in Münchner, they live in one of the few decentralised accommodations for allotted women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs joined the facility together with Pro Familia and the estuary of women's assistance.</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard against the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has done on her escape experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope", "she tells them."</seg>
<seg id="24">"among women, other reasons for escape:" many steal secretly, because they see no other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, compulsion, honorary, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rarity," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, once they anchor in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here also here, women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and worse if misused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the North of Munich, who are traumatized in the area of Munich."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"because they often do not help, they need more accommodations just for them, invites them."</seg>
<seg id="37">The seven District ruling classes in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question whether you are using a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, we answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there are so something in homes of governments not."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Schwaben, women are not separated themselves alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, sub- and medium-franken there are in some community shelters or separate houses for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception to Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men separately.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that was published for the committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are separately houses. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing, men and women are missing, it may be - constant violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, washing rooms should be easily accessible and can be easily accessible for women."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as much the women sense of this protective need, it is possible to dismiss the crush that there is on the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have spoken around, that there are us, we have a long queue," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of external sideways"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday, to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight months of the long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the Congolilded Hall of St. Petersburg Palace in Reception, I cannot tolerate myself that Ankara will most want this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the hand, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smiles, narrower and radiant little heat, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, spoke to his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report full of five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but they can even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day there was a newspaper that Erdogan so heard that Erdogan as if never had anything worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me it seemed more to be the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin desradiant, sustainable coolness showed that the State of Russia had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first one that he mentioned in his embodiment: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow from response to time was awakened.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin distributed and accused Ankara to have Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The decay was even larger as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Vetroen will rebuild once again if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months long, the nationally controlled media introduced a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one time, it seemed as if the Turks bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the most serious accusations were the accusations of the officers, that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria would have benefited from the so-called Islamist state."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg the official message was, that it is time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received by President Erdogan that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is first and foremost all the friends that he can get after spending last month at a failed state-coup almost of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and chartercompanies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week predict the state remote watching cheap fruits and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agricultural importers will be allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti forms it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West since it was the reaction to the tried to consider the power of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persistent Groll on the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to take advantage of the cool mood and decrease the relation of Turkey to the west."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian president won in Ankara, with security a bonus that he called after the trying coup to support for the elected government bodies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-deserved for Moscow - a matter of course, which has changed a deep-sitting fear of the regime."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey, one as it was once an analyst once described," Alliance of external sideheads ": two countries that violate the West and have been poorly treated."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey can support opposing pages."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after nearly three hours of initial discussions, both presidents at the press conference said that they would not even have had the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey avoided it clearly to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential as a complete dispaster, as NATO member Turkey has reached the Russian martial arts - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State at least talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the stated reformation of sound plates not on a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the novelties of physical objects, but due to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"those who have recently purchased one record, are all predictions after the age between 45 and 54."</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">"there is also no hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional importance: older records reserve their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it, alone time to spend (69% vs. 66%)."</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would like to follow the camera, while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest slipping trage and wild, before I steaming my hands and be a bit of things like:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos is slow on its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling up the buildings where independent sellers are located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman, to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and vegetables through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I run by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) into the recess Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, presumably around the 20) is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector that I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4.000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"sound plates, shown above (he sent me the snapshot via email, I did not followed him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when she appeared and buy objects that he sold, when he was young and bankrupt."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, where I probably was something to buy them," says he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy plates, rather introverted and like to spend their own time, and add:" I don't smoke and I drink not much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my emaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"NEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers meet, who meets the Youkv profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"but he has also noticed a new wave of people that have been influenced by the medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback, and led to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually have been kidnapped so by 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy back their records," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of the preset of a given age of age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to recognize that records a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some records fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to pull back to the stability of familiar sound plates, of objects, the happier Jugenderinns. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a emptiness or owned material possessions, as a kind of consolation," says NEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to engage in spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flare a staff from a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April contained that almost 50% of the people bought, the last month had bought a record, they have not heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey took out that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy one record, do not own a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while I was going through a stack at Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works in sounds of the Universe (data number: three men aged aged men) has a" "trophy" "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I do not own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiotead soundplate so that I can put them into the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less music small."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>

<seg id="44">"Flop that has dedicated the sound panels almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women middle age."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-standing shops, Wild Beasts of Synthesis and far-packed pop instead of experimental jazz rods from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them sees sonant, but naecology mental traumas are hard to detectable if one stands next to someone over 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around for some minutes in business and looks at the variability of the plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a managtal mortal as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of records is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way but the beauty of plates is... it drives with a adorned disease.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, of which is said that a new generation of record owners should have inspired: urban outlet."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the contend to mured the jeans Hotpants, I observed a group of young teenager, looking for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think, to buy a Crosley turntable player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees it - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is the most suitable for luxury conditions such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research results agree that the results of YouGov do, they leave, at least in records in Soho, the large number of female collectors and records that exist in reality, records and in Onlineforen."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday tomorrow with safety not taking the strolling through the grocery stores of Berwick Street and leaves through plates, while taking the starrenching view of an uncanny, 30-year false moderator, who protruined over the shoulders of nothing subtle men middle age."</seg>

<seg id="4">"thus, the emigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffused in the extremist way."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we observe the movement now.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the" "Identitular Movement" "is a grouping with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it turns against" "Multikulti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity by alienation."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Constitutional Court in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Saxony and Thuringia - watch the" "Identitular". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"Maate said, his authority is closely aligned with the offices."</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the 'Identitanic movement' try to pick up their target group, where it stands," said the Constitutional Court. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"generally speaking, extremists are speaking with youthful language, often with popped music."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Islamists, as well as the right-wing extremists."</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a false advertising for one's own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda should address the people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are very susceptible in a special way.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"recently, there had been reports from several federal states reports on contacts of the" "Identitular" "to AfD politicians."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maate said, he did not have any knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind will be relevant only from a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain individuals, the extremist, their goal is changing and so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">"thus, it is crucial if such people have taxable influence on the party."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the marked increase of legitimate criminal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee, he said Maate, he would not speak again in this context yet again."</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have observed in recent years that there can be right-frozen structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the whole group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may be quite that further right-wing groupings or small groups formed, the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee camps, or attacks from other far right-right motives plan."</seg>
<seg id="27">But a nationwide or European control of lawns may not be identified.</seg>
<seg id="28">The groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"concerned, Maate dined about that many transitions went to the account of people who have not appeared before in the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the scene at attack on Asylum, have previously not been known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"many people have thus committed criminal offences which were previously entitled with right-wing extremists, which might have been politically indifferent, or for example CDU, SPD or left, which is then radical in the right-right mood."</seg>

<seg id="2">"one day after they shot three gates during a 6-1 winner of Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won the Americans with 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people who kept their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, that knows them: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons on the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which the two within their group will gain six teams each of the first and second place."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed will take a little longer out of the way that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising number by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London games on the last 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in hands (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the USA's youngest in the history of the team."</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday night Bam opened the doorstep in the first half of the game with a return of the area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was gone without victory in the tournament in the game, but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam the game took her hands."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is also, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are being able to make themselves stable and non-evident, a rapid relellent between competition and endeavour."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the Olympic Fackel itself would be a burning rod, who was calibrated from wristy to the swimmers to the triathlete for the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you cannot listen to the television, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue in the Coffeear, without having to hear about Simone Biles, Katie Lefry or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad to go Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is doing it for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warm with dimples, could quite be sent under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time which would be available to Prime Time if he would have a swimmers, gymnasts, or even fairy."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic Flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: airbrush shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may last for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I might be modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me direct the attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney his debut, it was the last 16 years so pointed out that many of the ones I had asked, did not know that it is a Olympiasportart."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA had sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had a athletes, who made it up to the end."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear suitable for a clownsschool as the one for the Olympic Games sounds."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a sublime enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoons trembling of his never to end toning - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving that combines two sports that is essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" "springboard." "</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must land a number of falling moves (turning, heels and saltos) before they land on your feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are evaluated according to the official Olympiad for execution, difficulty and 'time times."</seg>
<seg id="24">"branches of athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are compete in Rio to each other."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medals hoped in their quest for gold further, faster, up and above, sometimes up to the destination, sometimes up and back down and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"you are hunting not only the Ziellinie or the output wall, but in the television transmission also another height of the world: that of the world or the Olympiarekords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the target-oriented quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a audience to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I want to look at the chance to look at these games as something.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this the trampoline offers an attraction.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prt, seemingly heelos like an astronaut, goes up, then after down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualifiers and endings of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also around 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will beam the ends as part of a afternoon block at both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of Olympia's Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when the raising of consciousness can only be reached by attage and lenses of male athletes, like the male U.S. Turner is recently determined according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley awaits its after air, new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that threaten protested during the clashes with the police in Schussel were killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to come together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it was one of the stabiliest countries of Africa, a solid foe of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months they shaken protests against the government the land and spread more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses showed that policemen shot on zig unarmed protesters and reddish.</seg>
<seg id="11">"moving videos about the protests, which presumably come from the last or beginning of this year, show how security men hit young people with shocks while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of the UN Office for Human Rights is now calling for an outgoing investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country and in future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands at the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendulum back in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet and safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously stated the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, with dissidents effective for silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or pushed into the expanses of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you push people suppress and these no other options have except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopien. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth are protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover everything from ground use up to the stranglehold coalition with respect to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition, and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this zackly, controversial line was asked in June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden that have been forced more or less in recent years to reuse turmoil and rearming themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of imbiting after years of before moving to Hints under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheap smartphones were becoming more and more common and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government supports access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still have to communicate via internet-rehearxies, which they hide where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave to that they gathered so to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since 1930, the Amharas, who come from orthopedics mainly to Christian high-countries, in politics and economy, while she had exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowlands areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing straight.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated unfair by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that constitute approximately 6 percent of the population, which are dominant in the military, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebellion leader, was up to his death on a non-publiciated disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly wasted in taking early signs of discontentment and special commissioner to use, to process opponents and make them harmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analysis. "</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively unsighted reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles. "</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of Nordhull, Mr. Hailemariam coming from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security controlled by the Tigray Safety Services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia was expecting such a turmoil, 2005, after thousands of voting protested apparently by the government apparently from the government and were then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"while the following rails were killed many protesters, even if there were less than in the last months, and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"developing experts praised the leaders of their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new pendulum, as well as their measurable progress in poverty control."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protraced in Gondar, a amharic town, of Tigray-guided shops and the hatred of the Tigray is always practiced in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests of the USA and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronym excursions on the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently rushed to closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"during the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his foe in an already volatile area collapses."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin-walk."</seg>

<seg id="3">These clarifications took new questions concerning the communication skills of the presidential system of the Republicans whether it was able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public.</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism, as he said, the Russians were supposed to send Mrs. Clint emails, but later he said" Of course, I said the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic limits to politics and then back to the need.</seg>

<seg id="23">"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," "Mr. Giuliani said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements, whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in that sense that Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her buttreser, completely wrong and therefore it came to pass the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as an outdoor ministerous, ISIS allowed themselves to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie usually come only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board ship</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland only get started with 150 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">"while the Greenland shark on the grounds of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is an average of just 1,220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five meters long animal speeds up to 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe with this maximum speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">But it seems to be a sponsor for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report the journal "Science" at least a Greenland which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein by Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means for vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the theory of evolution has been thought that Greenland become stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the skinny coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius they dive on the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyles of Greenland know researchers in accordance with little.</seg>
<seg id="17">"your time-pentagulation measures them, when they set up six animals in front of the sbergen six animals with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had the jaw of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly they chase for sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of ice cream, and are looking for carcasses, which are from higher water layers to the bottom."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenlandhaie, the fisherman between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long while the largest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method of the lens of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelet is already created before the birth of sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer redone."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest Haie had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s while nuclear weapons attempts to drag greater quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the length of third-centimeters in length of third animal, the lens uses a small surplus to carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland had a normal carbon-14 volumes in its lens with contrast to normal carbon-14 volumes created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 centimeters long Greenland shark an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters are even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland female only then grew up when they are longer than four metres, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"because one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably rose on the threshold to sexually mature, and his age with 156 years was determined, there was obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">"also, it is likely to be a world record for vortices."</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live especially in icy waters is not an accident.</seg>
<seg id="34">"even the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland, in whose speck at the neck at the neck, a 120 years old harpostage top was captured, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is a lot of people living there."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and then slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep up in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal is heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible," explains the evolution of evolution. "</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal was supposed to invest in a long life rather than a long life.</seg>

<seg id="16">"however, where private users use the personal photo database on the game, it's about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is breastfeeding."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware suggests."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies highlighted sales loss due to ransomware, 13 per cent, even the business operations had to completely interrupt, in case of a case people were fasting."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by loss of hospitals."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pays not, it promotes just the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, will get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to establish a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researcher from F-Secure reserves the user's usefulness and contact with the researchers and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to take a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain to their victims by chat as they can pay via Bitcoin, do free-accessible support websites or decode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will receive private people after payments of a few hundred billion euros, companies need to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to redeem their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively riskless gains from the ransomware, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explained security experts Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus-provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within one week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, it is that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their contaminants then in the form of a software construction to the actual blacksmith.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits were created by malware themselves, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the package includes a adaption tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackers then seek further hackers to spread the newly created software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so, one logs in one of the forums in the underground, purchases the set of a crime and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infiable calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then bear spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known for many companies which make their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies-companies in the Malwarebytes survey will trust that Ransomware able to withdraw from file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful testing, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as customer-lists or pricing, explains Malwarebytes Marcin Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this is the potential for damages, depending on the type of data is still higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators could also be able to take completely new goals on the Internet of Things."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated security researchers, as they were able to receive a thermostat with the Internet" thermostat "under its control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter, the deactivation of such a non-blocked heating could definitely be a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrator then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production street in a factory, Ransomware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you can sit eternally, at night it is far from the wake-up. in the morning, it is far from the Weckerklingling no longer to think about sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one with such problems is in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleeping disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of insomnia, and there are many causes underlying to them, stresses Hans-Günter Wemet, executive committee of the German Society for sleeping research and sleeping medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands it is, but the Insomnever, therefore, is an input and transverse-disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"right now, many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Hausphysician association with practice in lower Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of insomnia are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can organic, mental or tolerated factors, but also medicines are stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleedisorder expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking up is common especially during a depression," "says Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors would like to meet each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for instance, has a band excretion, can be bad, watch every two to three hours, and blurably begin to salute through everyday problems and worry, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you be with sleep-disturbances to a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who has not sleeps over a period of one month in at least three nights per week, and the day is impaired, should go to the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can be quite different: it is downcast, tired, unexhausted, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily chargeable, has singular fluctuations or bodily ailments like gastric or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleep, it is important to figure their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options, inter-treatment options, a cognitive behavioural therapy or medications - classic sleeping tables only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - infrequent."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rainfall, in Germany there are hardly any, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary dormitory of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, one should first turn to the doctor's problem at first, betray Wear."</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem can be clarified with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens there?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for study in sleeping laboratory medicine: medicine, for example, in snoring with breathing difficulties, in case of sleepisters or if you cannot find the cause of a sleeability, explains fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">There is no need to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make lunch," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">After the wiring one goes to his normal time into the bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"beside the electrodes in the body you can bear a nose, a chest strap and a antennas at the finger."</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in the matter of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">"furthermore, she is a social worker on site."</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July is Annika Deuschle the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogical supports the team of administration by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it sees itself as a contact person for all players: refugees, labour and refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else could mislead."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a customer of the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deuschle now is, the eiving Wollussau, which is above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so, some - less pointed than rather on the variety of desired fields, meant as the administration wanted to write."</seg>
<seg id="9">"searched for a management of management with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, such an engrossing wollussau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"yet, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organizing work, working with local people and behind the scenes as well as networks."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for approximately six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle ehrer and general actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and racial problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the washing-street</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem, it has been recognized for some time, apartments for the connecting-lines that have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accomodate the refugees in their own or rented housing spaces.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of construction, rent or refurbishment of these accommodations must be the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landratory to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"it has not been working so far so far, be dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, non-governmental apartments must be rented as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing-street.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a firm cap, there are internship places, training courses, training courses, one-euro jobs and export activities for refugees and migrants that have to be tiled or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help homework, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community to conduct a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "not a employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity does not mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a voiority.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers like sport, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are shaved.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you also jump here administration and volunteered.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the process is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you must explain the refugees that it just takes, and they can bridge the time necessary to bridge, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually make sense, it could not help in Urbach anyone who might not work and be useless, he will never integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, there is also, says customer honest," people, in which nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is already a" "mammoth task." ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two after the recent years are afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine client quite clearly," "what mancher may call". "a rest risk can and does not want to exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">"however, the helpers are already sensitive."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They could have the fear that the attacks they bring them completely to call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main - and volunteering must be held on the ground and in the region after activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clear, shy the policy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place it helpers on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived, where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, this would be the location to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that Urbacher are already very busy to integrate the previous human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, one must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
