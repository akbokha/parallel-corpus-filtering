Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friend@@ ly@@ .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as backing Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in this meeting , however , it should also be a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
Obama &apos;s relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington is critic@@ ised the constant expansion of Israel and the absence of a lack of peace in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal promoted by Obama &apos;s deal about the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two further deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March Netanyahu had held a controversial issue at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress , held in front of the US Congress , which was declared partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this im@@ pending election in Israel . &quot;
in a call @-@ call professor to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; in a call of not@@ h@@ ore Professor Sh@@ annon , he told his friend &apos;s voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family @-@ contact of dead women could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s and a hand@@ written note that was dressed in a white block , I didn &apos;t miss , I loved it , I loved Amy and she was the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who moved in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , signed , already 300 miles for the school grounds , where he shot at his office after the police and killed himself in his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tic@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University &apos;s staff should be shooting at 10 : 18 h .
he said that he has made the fatal emergency day after then .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police sol@@ ed him .
&quot; one day after shooting in the university , the students and faculty are forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators in both entities of the State , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw an image of a talented , but perhaps difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they had their own lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s died , he did not have any history of violence or a crime history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned a written book in one of his written book in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his ac@@ adem@@ ical life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the department of social sciences and history , whose faculty are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some prophecies to be problematic .
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb , he said , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told that he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; never before the Delta State University had asked for a absence of health reasons , and in doing so , that he had some health problem . &quot;
in this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; due to recent changes in the employment policy of the university , the doc@@ torate , for which he had worked so hard , would not represent an automatic path to an employment of a Assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said he is nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Presentation . &quot;
they are questions that it is impossible to answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police took a slide mark later when he got back to Mississippi from Ark@@ ans@@ as import . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , killed it self @-@ self with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ols in the backyard of a house approximately a mile south of his par@@ ental home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
it grew up in the area .
&quot; he began its work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gical . &quot;
he graduated in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the many years of friend@@ ships assumed him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach their guitar playing . &quot;
he was then the women of women .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted to there when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson City of Bran@@ don . &quot;
Lamb and pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s were obviously some time together .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick building , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she was fifteen years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues .
&quot; Lamb of Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up three years ago both in the summer years . &quot;
later they played together one or the other .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a Bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes maintenance coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted cash at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted Bar held in the night of September 5th for the last time , after the Lamb of his guitar and harmon@@ ic acid completed before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there were no evidence of anything that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the morning and crossed up together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the fresh@@ ers seminar program and specialized on American natives and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , an English @-@ professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Fel@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the Committee of the Stu@@ dents .
&quot; on the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the community attended a candl@@ elight ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the press guard , while the Universal Declaration &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the lessons are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this review . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says , that he made the not@@ ary , after he had made the emergency , and that lamb in his call was called upon his wife , but there is no indication that the two were ever married . &quot;

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually gets clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary &quot; back in Time . &quot;

&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon , his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen both violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;

8 Re@@ frac@@ tures that demonstrate that Donald Tru@@ mp are serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; however , no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks to the p@@ olls , it has ( still ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate @-@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too soon in the election period . &quot;
no claims that Tru@@ mp are likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 R@@ ick Per@@ r@@ ys Leadership has been given to the rising Herman C@@ ain , from which no one has only gained a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sides groups like J@@ eb b@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s stamina and start to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pop@@ ular values have turned about 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy to the middle of June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
these figures remain in early countries .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ voting in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have found a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ torate GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as a candidate .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans , they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; &quot; cont@@ ented &quot; &quot; if tur@@ mp would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of them say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent said , they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same above Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in matters of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; dis@@ appearances , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Re@@ public@@ ans sees Tru@@ mp@@ s tem@@ per not considered a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp are widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and bel@@ lic@@ ated statements , 52 percent of the Republi@@ can Irish voters believe that real temper@@ ament have the right temper@@ ament for a President , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is found in the first court state of the nation , the federal state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for the commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to carry out effectively , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that temper@@ ament is not into the White House p@@ asse , ABC / Post . &quot;
re@@ publi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if she envel@@ op her nest , hold re@@ publi@@ can voters tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who won the GO@@ P nom@@ ination after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four out of ten passed their money on th@@ ief Bush .
&quot; complete Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ torate , in the past did not have the clear@@ est crystals . &quot;
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Re@@ public@@ ans were thought that R@@ ick Perry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ constitu@@ ents can be seen as plau@@ si@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; even when the re@@ public@@ ans collected around another candidates , Tru@@ mp strikes almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts indicate that the spl@@ itting field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen of other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypothe@@ tical mind @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other re@@ publi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp wi@@ dens multi @-@ issues . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before Jeph@@ th@@ n Bush 19 points and finally before the edge of Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypothe@@ tical mind @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans says that they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a new survey of CB@@ S / NY@@ T show on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half the elec@@ torate , the Tru@@ mp support that they have set up their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to altern@@ ate to other candidates .
&quot; however , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters saying that they have formed their opinion are twice as common to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they must match with Tru@@ mp in the subject of immigration .
&quot; since then , Donald Tru@@ mp was called in his election campaign before two months immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; &quot; was the immigration of revolutions , and the point of public discourse in the public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tru@@ mp are crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans to stop away from the Republi@@ can party and re@@ integrate the new @-@ oriented efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ pol@@ l from Monday they say six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans that they must match with Tru@@ mp in questions of immigration .
&quot; so long as the immigration in the spot@@ light is thrown , there will be Donald Tru@@ mp to do . &quot;
the frustration of the government climbed to new high@@ s .
&quot; at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , there is now about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , primarily from their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new assembly line of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by four I@@ owa @-@ Re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich . Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive accommodations in Germany
here in the hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg path there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the road a square meter apartment costs an average of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt is the offer of objects naturally , it is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which special clim@@ ates a square meter at the most cost . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top towns , one of the prices comes in the price of Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and id@@ ols
doubt Tor@@ ner in Pir@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply a run .
a Happy Bir@@ th of Thomas Müller paved the FC Bayern the way to a missed 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ad Pir@@ na - then ran it .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Al@@ e have provided the FC Bayern at the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Piraeus a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their role play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ad in hot atmosphere thanks to garbage dump ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ dol 57 ( 8@@ 9th ) worthy of 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth campaign success in series will be the first step towards Finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t after Munich .
Müller was awarded on the Champions League for the Champions League of the Champions League for Bavaria leadership team at the Champions League for Bayern ak@@ os @-@ go@@ alie &apos;s Roberto which had to happen as f@@ ke shooting of the world &apos;s champion .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; had promised Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game in Kara@@ is@@ k@@ akis @-@ Stadium before the 3@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich &apos;s headed . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without to shine .
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his youngest six home play in the top class , including against renowned clubs as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 we stum@@ bled here in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they were brave and often imagin@@ ably to works in their aggressive efforts .
the attacks were reported too often by the shift on link@@ ages on Link@@ sau@@ ces some Costa initiated that was rarely crossed against the former SPD O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck far from the right as his f@@ lange is s@@ ulated out of the right semi @-@ field in the left upper right .
at the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ k@@ owski .
first he scored as the Olympic @-@ storms Brown the head ball of Poland by the line ( 26 ) .
&quot; then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ alie were par@@ ked with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) . &quot;
&quot; despite the Bavaria you are used to place the dominant game , re@@ aus and re@@ aus . &quot;
on door@@ ke@@ eper Manuel Neu@@ er was Lost .
thus approximately when he had a shot of ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
he allowed to defend Gu@@ ardi@@ ola a four @-@ legged friend with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ closely which made it good .
&quot; Mario H@@ e , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat at first . &quot;
&quot; the WC @-@ hero was given first after the closing session , he said , &quot; &quot; Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; in the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to take him against him , when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the Lew@@ k@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; i@@ dol rose late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) , and made 13 minutes later everything clear , per El@@ f@@ meters put there still a dr@@ on . &quot;
in front of the game it came to Kra@@ w@@ ang in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of some ver@@ m@@ um@@ ed Bavaria fans in their audience members , the supporters of Host@@ aus , with words and gest@@ ures prov@@ oked , attacked the security forces and went off against the Mün@@ chner . &quot;
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was hurt from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , cause not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that places a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : in case of aband@@ on@@ ment the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this goes out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smokers lay the risk to waste their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely , around the 2,@@ 5@@ - up to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major contribut@@ ors for tooth @-@ loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ um , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor to stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and the dental loss therefore go back to frequent dental g@@ ums with smokers .
&quot; not clear , however , the risk for tooth decay is also increased . &quot;
&quot; people who heard with smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; however , it can last more than ten years until the threat goes back to the level of non @-@ smoking , the du@@ ck Thomas Dietrich explained by the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; it is necessary to convince people of it , non @-@ smokers , explained academic manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking is shortened the lifetime . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads after our findings also to a good dental health through to the high age .
&quot; in Germany , over 20 per cent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years have been affected by dent@@ ures , shared the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
earlier studies had already pointed out that smoking the risk for early dent@@ hair .
the new long @-@ term study support the findings .

EU Commission proposes a new court against TTIP
&quot; to increase the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlantic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbitration system . &quot;
the controversial private arbitration devices for li@@ tig@@ ations between affiliated groups and states are intended to be replaced by a transparent system that is significantly more traditional than traditional dishes in its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system which trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; declared by Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström &apos;s decision . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the proposal aims to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free @-@ trade negotiations with the US . &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP must create the largest free @-@ trade zone of the world with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings are shown that the EU states and the USA are shared independent judges for a new European Court of Justice .
they are supposed to come to the same parts from the EU and the USA and third countries .

specialities Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; in addition to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the intim@@ id@@ ated Fol@@ ks@@ er has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with fil@@ z@@ sti@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken from Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
he tells the basis of different places that he always records on the map called his min@@ u@@ deci@@ du@@ ous and delicate songs .
&quot; where they were created and how it looks , in his homeland . &quot;
since then Stev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative del@@ ine .
&quot; with 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear clever songs , which can be harmon@@ i@@ ously near to American folk folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always be in a great sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a written series : each of the 50 U.S. federal states sol@@ dering in succession . &quot;
&quot; however , in 2004 and in Rhin@@ eland already the &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; already appeared and breaks positive certain expectations . &quot;
Stev@@ ens can be reduced here .

a year later he returns to the series in New York .

the album is entered in the US Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any yearly @-@ list of the most influ@@ ential music media .
&quot; after exceedingly productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic de@@ posit@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; this sixth album album is still widely orchest@@ rated , however supported by programmed sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall . &quot;
&quot; long ago by the smaller clubs , the stage shows are here for the colorful spectacle from Ne@@ on @-@ Stir@@ n@@ b@@ ändern and large auto@@ fluor@@ escent stages . &quot;

&quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musicians from the wide @-@ enriched album . &quot;
&quot; from the audience you hear : the lecture is &quot; &quot; sacrifice &quot; &quot; and you can therefore throw the &quot; &quot; top &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut in the fre@@ eroll of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister with eag@@ erly awaited &quot;
the new Labour president of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister and set up with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to put the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon ; his performance is probably checked by the media and the Labour members of the Labour Party .
he asked &quot; less theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could jump over some meetings to commit to her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary trial for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as she comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ an et , and his speech at TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the decision of the Labour president , on Tuesday during the singing of the national anth@@ ems in silence , critic@@ ised the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ isms of a number of T@@ ory P@@ MPs and stands at the center of several introduction pages @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n decision , not to sing the national hym@@ n , has drawn attention to itself &quot;
&quot; said a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , he would have been &quot; &quot; respectful of silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ an , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two &apos;s night program , he got the Labour president to sing the National An@@ ah , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the monarchy was to be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ar@@ ns in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ar@@ ns , and they are called on differences in business , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as a leader . &quot;
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within Labour Party and Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns prono@@ unc@@ ements to the European Union and the limit in winnings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to put Labour modifications in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow occupational and pensions Minister , that the party &quot; was very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26.@@ 000 l@@ bs to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Chairman , David Cameron , since he has been tas@@ ked with him , who has been facing the Disp@@ atch box in the parliament last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour president who promised a different policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the freight calls of the Prime Minister to confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he has done both &quot; &quot; Imp@@ act &quot; &quot; and the spreading of resistance with resistance and instead , to concentrate on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela St@@ by@@ n spoke that Angela Eagle is represented in him that he is not participating - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he has also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally also take the word , and that John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; as he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron want to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; , &quot; who often went over with the question of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he was going to have failed . &quot;
&quot; as she was first sent to television first in 1990 , the frac@@ tion@@ ist was seen with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer for his leadership in the House and his position in the House of Commons , and his position in the House of Commons , although critics have ar@@ gues , they become a caric@@ ature and have sufficient reforms . &quot;

pounds increases due to accelerated pay@@ growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound rose straight to data , which show an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom . parallel to this the FT@@ SE has increased 100 by the prayer target of SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result was increased without bonuses in the United Kingdom to 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and high degree of assessment on the date of a interest of interest .
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % on 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over @-@ offer of the Rival AB In@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and brands like Bud@@ dy , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were looking after encouraging news from the competition Group for Luxury Goods A@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
&quot; Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that the sales in China is a key market for Bur@@ berry , once more growth . &quot;
&quot; stocks of Gl@@ enc@@ ore climbed by 5 % after the mining esis , that he had 2.5 billion US $ by a share of equity as part of his strategy of debt management . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MO@@ N@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers in the index , and with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had its assessment of the rating based on &quot; ratings . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.@@ 1 % , after a pre @-@ tax result for the six months reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million . &quot;
the Chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages minim@@ ise the expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &apos; might mean more buying power into the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this department will win the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added and that could mean it will be less additional jobs . &quot;

P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster brings liberal on Pot@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or t@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; it is both - and indeed in the potato @-@ farmer , who has developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger Im@@ bis@@ cus @-@ hostess Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement has put Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat along a bul@@ lock .
&quot; the idea brought him a poster with a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the &quot; &quot; potato &quot; &quot; potato &quot; &quot; that he had seen by chance on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his shop he turns into a barbe@@ cu@@ le , who is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea of the Lebanese has in the meantime adopted the patent in Munich in the meantime .
there she has been protected as a used manual according to the authority of the authority .
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes of the sp@@ y does not contain , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it is getting together even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;

Met@@ rac starts closing campaign on the fight against al@@ di@@ - att@@ acking
&quot; Met@@ am attempts to protect the Ig@@ A chain in front of a Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia . &quot;
&quot; food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a ground independent campaign , in order to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di @-@ invasion . &quot;
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia beginning of next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A supermarkets , strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing on the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands like Eis@@ manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed in Ig@@ A stores Samples and Lad@@ der @-@ hostess , which sell tickets for the South Australian football liga to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will further details to his defence strategy on 29 September , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices carries out its annual investors strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ counter @-@ shops , and generate higher pay@@ outs as a Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ network in the east states . &quot;
&quot; purchas@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ic provincial and Ig@@ A retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , an@@ alysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets grew about five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing players , but mostly self @-@ continu@@ ances sales will take away . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er 360 would lose $ 250 million per year and by Met@@ cash 250 million from the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this progn@@ osis was based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens up 25 branches in SA and 30 in W@@ A , and generates sales of € 500 million and 600 million in every market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and grocery store and in the quantities at Met@@ cas@@ hs high fixed , low cash could cost around 13 million US $ earnings before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the east states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ do@@ ers are the most faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ hs sales in food and food shop increased by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 to 4.@@ 1 per cent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 per cent in 2018 and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week the leading F@@ ond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business eating in Melbourne , that Met@@ at@@ probably will likely van@@ ish within a decade . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ charges subsequently reject it , publicly responding to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass . &quot;
but it is assumed that a committee member of Met@@ am with Mr Dou@@ glass last week Contact has received .
&quot; &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 per cent and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs to food and grocery stores , which has approximately 1.200 Ig@@ A retail@@ er , has since 2012 decreased by 43 percent , which is reflected by simultaneous pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ al@@ ers , however , is investing more than 150 million dollars to provide sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ms in hundreds of products each week and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private @-@ label food products . &quot;
&quot; Ian Mor@@ rice , Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the price adjustment and loading programs can be made to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to profitability in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ akis is supported by President of the Australian tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ akis earned rather praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ akis was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gios and deserves a view of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly more praise than criticism for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ te@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; ran through the in@@ famous examination of K@@ yr@@ gios with st@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ te@@ akis had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rators taking Har@@ rison . &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat K@@ yr@@ gios , and I should sm@@ ash the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he was sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp suffered a potential US Open victory of Richard gas quet , Kok@@ te@@ akis was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , a competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in order to find the second place in an individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I tigh@@ ter up rather , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi has been drawn a little in the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et , when he lost because of a class struggle in the US Open , but he is not the first player who made a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Tor@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he studied extremely well in the US Open extremely well , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he earned much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around you , and I think he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very powerful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is well in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider K@@ yr@@ gios on the important pre@@ f@@ icient decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gios &#93; &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick was very quick to climb , to what people like a Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray did . he asc@@ ends in the eyes of the public and he deserves to support him . some time outside the ram@@ p , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the crew and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary declared the emergency and bol@@ ted the south@@ border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to stop illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed on the border , as hundreds of migrants accumulated in an oak and Serbian be@@ amer with rebellion . &quot;
&quot; the people having fled from violence , have hidden for an unknown period in a land strip off the street between the two points of control and built up tents , and settled there . &quot;
but have gone forth .
&quot; as a police helicopter above them s@@ inter@@ woven , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; and they cried against the Hungarian polic@@ emen . &quot;
some exp@@ ats from protest foods and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign ministers stated that immigrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ al@@ harm .
&quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
&quot; the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ Block at a hard meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could agree . &quot;
&quot; the ministers agreed , however , to share the responsibility for 40@@ ,000 people who were looking for over Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would conclude that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on an informal action from Brussels or by its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the Emer@@ gency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could ha@@ un@@ lock roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said , that his country was also planning to build a go@@ st@@ wire to the border with Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the land - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; CB@@ S News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pr@@ isons were used in competition , bar@@ bed @-@ wire @-@ fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East as well as a point of view into the European Union .
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has noted , however , that most of the upcoming economic migrants are , looking for a better life , and not war @-@ linear , which are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction with other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high za@@ us who had to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also set higher prison charges for condemned human dealers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the immigration country , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said government speakers Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ ac Re@@ por@@ ters in the southern City of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very distinc@@ tly : illegal border crossing is a crime .

election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s Vor@@ sprung from Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a two @-@ digit head@@ start in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie wins her to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters for the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent increase ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he added for the Office of the presidential office , will receive support for 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months prior to the beginning of the presidential elections , most of the democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion p@@ olls , which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more resistant to their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while moving some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections are reduced . &quot;
&quot; their support among the men is significantly decreased , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; clinics &apos;s advantage with democratic constitu@@ ents below 50 years have moved , and they are now equal to equal height . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a big lead in the elderly voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ figure leap for the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 point lead during this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the country elections , they had to support Clinton , when they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
a quarter would support them with some pres@@ ets and further 15 percent would only support them because they have nom@@ inee as a candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons of current supporters in particular are enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently not support Clinton - just about a quarter they would love it .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that Clinton can not support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less re@@ publi@@ can this over their leading kan@@ di@@ data Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons supporters in an open question are asked , why they want that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 per cent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; approval for dealing with the problems and constitu@@ ency is also cited . &quot;
&quot; as the Vice President throws a potential for the presidential office to the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections will see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters of the presidential elections will be asked to be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ t followers , we say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; decided to run by Bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s leadership is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with be@@ es in betting on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate , with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 per cent over the last month . &quot;
&quot; bid@@ der is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage who sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is important when a candidate is more important , democracy @-@ voters ask questions about the constitu@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate to this choice of election is considered unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic Candi@@ dates or potential candidates will provide good results with some important features for the presidential elections of their party .
&quot; we consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership mod@@ alities . &quot;
Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates most often from honesty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is leadership .
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the presidential elections also generally Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ bin@@ ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
for all these measurements a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
&quot; as questions on Hill@@ ary Clinton to continue to use a personal e @-@ mail address and server , during the period of time , most of the Democratic voters of the prior election are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that their opinions were not influenced in total . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail controversy sur@@ faced no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton has become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is viewed from the voters of their party as honest and trusted , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less than in May . &quot;
62 percent of voters do not keep them up to be honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the voting country is far behind tru@@ mp as not honest and not trusted . &quot;
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are good notes under management .
&quot; of the six tried candidates , Bi@@ ches , Car@@ son and Bush get best in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees too differently than honest , but as with car@@ son many do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; the fault rate for the sampling of 3@@ 51 duty voters for the presidential elections is 6 pp . &quot;
Ben Car@@ son approaches regional further survey near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of CB@@ S News / New York Times Square close to Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the meantime , half of the elec@@ torate will decline in the new survey , and others will lose dramatically . &quot;
re@@ publi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in great numbers . the support grows of 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey conducted in front of the Fox News Deb@@ ate in the last month to 27 % in survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son came from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son in demo@@ graphic groups will arrive well and is sur@@ rendered to Tru@@ mp under re@@ publi@@ can voters with university education .
&quot; the remainder of the field , except by Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ aba , has fallen out with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , which was most profound , with 10 % support last month at now 2 % . &quot;
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush the former governor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio find themselves 6 % on the third place .
the fault tolerance in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support among the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; having regard to one of the last week &apos;s rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some aspect of aspect for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after car@@ son to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for it to put Tru@@ mp@@ s faith into question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing @-@ temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean are currently warm up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if central values are measured only in the distance , it is enough for swi@@ m@@ b to find a trip to the Mediterranean in order to propose a warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; since no longer goes into the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water is divided into the North and Baltic Sea during this week , the German Wetter@@ dienst ( D@@ W@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the sea temperatures still offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College
&quot; almost two years after a student during a single @-@ channel ritual , as a student @-@ connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , dec@@ eas@@ ed , were lod@@ ged for five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of New York &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ PSI pushed , Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g took place during an introductory session in September 2013 and moved his transport to hospital , which has contributed to his death , he divided the police . &quot;
&quot; be@@ amer said , he had been charged with related eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack of sand , and repeated , while he tried to have a frozen field on a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally came about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ Brotherhood does not calling the emergency number 911 , after den@@ g was power@@ less and waited a hour before they brought it into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; they had however the time to switch from D@@ eng@@ s clothing to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said Poli@@ tic@@ ef Chris Wagner on a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of hiding the utensils and placed the welfare of the Brotherhood , princip@@ ally by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ tic@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his wounds . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy , Den@@ g repeated with bl@@ unt power injury to head , torso and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the cla@@ ws of the Brotherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 each year at the gun , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bru@@ der@@ ations and their members must be held accountable , and that step by government authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for murder of third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for mis@@ leading attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not just want to make the persons responsible , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - this sanc@@ tioned we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has re@@ vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the town @-@ group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increase interest rates
&quot; a laying height comes , and the house is going to fall back , yield to bonds will increase , and the economy will gli@@ de into a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it all take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history for the economy is limited to the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ vity of the Federal Reserve with raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial system respond . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so force@@ ful that investors should not concentrate on when they start to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is required for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; in the end , market participants could notice , however , that the whole excitement because of an inser@@ tion period might be exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Princip@@ al Con@@ ferences with Capital Economics , at a Communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still on too low level to fear the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear many . &quot;
&quot; this , however , does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a set of historical trends based on how some areas of business could react :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the onset of inser@@ tions can make things vol@@ ati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the increase occurs , the influence is not as dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to be deduc@@ ted from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might be reflected once more the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysis in a newer study on what happens to the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has grown in the last 35 years mostly in up@@ scale - about 14 per cent - on the way to cement under@@ mining , fairly flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , boss system @-@ Str@@ ate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the German Bank said that the impact on the shares are later occurring later in the increasing cycle and the rendering time begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but the body @-@ elev@@ ations promote it often . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed has faced with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
most remarkable is that Gross Dom@@ estic Product is located near its lowest point of inser@@ tion the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to German Bank , 118 cent@@ en@@ ation existed since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , only few of them expect to last and expect the third quarter at Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting ca@@ vities at a so fragile economical backdrop could be risky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; if this time is different &quot; , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have taken all year on an inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee during this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many Str@@ ate@@ gen and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC is holding an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade mark only a total of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all sub @-@ cycles of 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ sion@@ ing went very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadow &quot; , &quot; so the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months now . &quot;
&quot; solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ le , since the market occupies an inser@@ tion process , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; if bonds appear to switch the direction , as soon as the first increase / reduction takes place in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the rise cycle , the bond @-@ endi@@ x drop immediately , the German Bank said . &quot;
the Str@@ ate@@ gen of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yield to move closer to the interest rates between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; floo@@ ding bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ analy@@ zer at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , thinks that the markets have already adapted itself to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation maintenance , there are a number of signs that the market has adapted to stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest have risen , the Cre@@ dit@@ ch has risen and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole , companies that benefit the greater part of their operations in the US , from which interest rates are increasing and local products are more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational corporations with high debt will be worse , because an increase of dollars on the global market makes it more expensive and also financing their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months after an initial post@@ ures , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have greatly exceeded companies with a growth balance sheet in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot;
&quot; companies with high capital yield and low vol@@ ati@@ lity in their shares exceeded their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) . &quot;
debt will become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest are most likely to lose .
&quot; outside of pure corporations , consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollars . &quot;
&quot; as@@ par@@ agus could see profits by higher yields , even if experts in different opinion are , how quickly this will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM @-@ Gesellschaft Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the station because of his &quot; &quot; distor@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly distingu@@ ish@@ able by commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said she im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its .
EP colleague Col@@ lins Col@@ lins hold off the Voice The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claim@@ ing a leader in parliament and increases new pressure on the radio station to prove that he does not do something that does not do the private sen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses , that the publicly @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ent &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and are increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn out Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also served on the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its appear to be only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you can actually only im@@ itate anything already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Director dism@@ issed the accus@@ ations , and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and public education . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn anything about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and to give the engagement of Radio 3 , to find new music and to give new works in order I get really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey taught that it is harder to work to engage the audience , as it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC &apos;s production , which at the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport can move under fire , to enter the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle The Voice on - the musical talent show at the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall consisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dges - &quot; was produced in special BBC @-@ way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wishes himself to find that the company &quot; &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; , &quot; when the next time it runs an entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , it refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money the stir@@ er@@ ers for other consumer formats . &quot;
Internet sales climbed by August on the slow@@ est and Black Friday may be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online selling .
last month the lowest result was since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online @-@ sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down .
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping is bo@@ oted and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into v@@ ultur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now signs that the online revenues are stag@@ nating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the overall expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
&quot; experts say that there are signs that online sales tournaments , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot;
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G selling point in the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online @-@ sales wins over three years ago , as a buyer starting to make shopping with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now it comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth decreased . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America was cited as a reason for indul@@ gence . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers can hold their purchases in this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
&quot; last year , the average number of buyers will start to make their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers desc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that black Friday , in which the buyers could prevent bar@@ gain , buyers from it could do more shopping . &quot;
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that spending 5 £ o spending a little more than 1 £ a .
&quot; for some products like TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases can now be done via Web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it purchases more than a quarter of the people clothes and shoes online instead of the films in the cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mecca on crane @-@ accident accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family
the corp@@ ses from 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first f@@ uneral in Mecca through the streets
Saudi @-@ Arabia is breaking down the collapse in part of the vast Sau@@ dic Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group .
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were wounded after the crane cr@@ ashed
hundreds of Muslims were gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury the bur@@ ies who were killed when a crane at Mek@@ k@@ m@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee was rus@@ hed .
&quot; gri@@ eving crowded , largely dressed in white , the circuit in order to win their respect , as the first of the dead settled their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ol@@ itan cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the grape @-@ procession passed on the Holy Sites , where only days before a construction crane at the roof of the mosque and then on those praying . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ ses were released for the bur@@ ial , when the Saudi @-@ king over the construction company of the Family Bin Laden , because of the catastrophe , which left also 3@@ 94 wounded , a re@@ fraction . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ ses of 29 Bet@@ s , who were killed , as a crane through the Great Central mosque of Mecca , were carried by the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane was under@@ gone . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officers have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch after Mecca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would not have to ste@@ al the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
an Arabic version of Decree of L@@ gs that was published by the state Saudi Press Agency ( said that the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group is responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the management of the company will travel abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man will un@@ veil , which caused the overthrow of the crane caused in a courtyard of the big mo@@ sh@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place in this month . &quot;
the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ Group did not have any statements about the collapse of the sick and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal decre@@ e also impeccable the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they do not co @-@ operates with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes in the Mek@@ k@@ mosque is regarded as part of the massive building project that is led by the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ Group .
the Bin Laden has been connected with the sovereign family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qa@@ eda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a ab@@ rup@@ tive son who was disp@@ at@@ ched by the family in the 1990 @-@ 1980 period . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came into the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in a life of every healthy bo@@ asting . &quot;
officials said that 158 people will stay in hospital .
government officials agreed that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same sum in the last one .
other wounded received half of this amount .

&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten trading choices in the shop are taken by women . &quot;
&quot; in the moment , among the employees the men prevail . &quot;
&quot; she said , it is necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female Single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this stronger to a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers are made up of 80 percent of the world &apos;s decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British representative in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index panel , also has its top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial management . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity here is an important issue . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her det@@ ects a decline of the half @-@ year profit and the ren@@ ders after the group paid the cost of the fund of stores .
&quot; due to the trend is King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has opened 200 new branches . &quot;
functional from A@@ I / D@@ ob because of im@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the State Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday two functions of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master &apos;s A@@ I / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and disp@@ enser .
the accused did not guilty .
one of them has also been charged with regard of ministers .
from this accus@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted in May of the exec@@ utable .
the current process has been postponed .
&quot; according to upper @-@ state attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ investigations that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 funds from club accounts , which they were allowed in their functions disp@@ uted , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; this damage occurs with some 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the sport functions are also charged for financial failures .
&quot; this fact was marked by the Chairman of the Sh@@ ro@@ en@@ sen@@ ats , Ri@@ chter@@ in Micha@@ ela San@@ in , aus . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represents that the association had at no time been part of an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries would have been worth the allowance and compensation for the Sport@@ club , for which they have been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they have invested a lot of time and money , brought out of debts - the pas@@ va logged in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we keep the club further , or un@@ lock it ? &quot; , &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , one of the accused , in the Br@@ ot@@ ex wholesale market in the financial market . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and collaborators , he then decided to take this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have prescribed money , uns@@ ett@@ led our life insurance policies as safety at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the arrival . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with the association : you can have the money free , there are only no debt to be done . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , with the financial - success , the withdrawal of the purchased compensation by 1991 was determined retro@@ actively by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore one has been part of the allowance for years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus had been on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore also l@@ ump - and not detailed rep@@ ut@@ ations , explained the former ob@@ mann the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and par@@ don@@ ors managed in common , the two def@@ endants , said the second accused . &quot;
why the withdrawal from the association were not detailed and asked the judge in detail .
&quot; the society has not been interested in detail for the financial mining industry , which is important only the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 against the one function investigations into account of ministers , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were previously , the accused have said . &quot;
&quot; this securities went on behalf of the second def@@ endants , and were not known to the association according to the statement of the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
&quot; after that , the respon@@ dent did not know an answer . &quot;
&quot; then he said , he said , he believed that this is the best for the society . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor has moved into the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ def@@ endants have been informed , correct himself the functional . &quot;
this money has been formulated as &quot; claims submission . &quot;
why contam@@ in@@ dem@@ nity ? who wanted to know Ri@@ chter@@ ine and prosec@@ utor .
&quot; however , the first accused did not agree with this wording as the association had never been causing damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the attorney says , &quot; &quot; With him you are all out of the c@@ utter . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore the functional , he never referred a cent content , he merely charged o@@ dom@@ eter value and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; however , at di@@ ets , he put in charge of the association 1,000 euros per month , the actual effort was however much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not prove the accused .
&quot; these are after an operation in which everything had been judged as correct , no longer stored , they explained . &quot;
mil@@ e@@ allowance had also used the second accused .
&quot; all dom@@ eb@@ ings are in cash , in order to have to drive from his residence international market to the bank to B@@ lei@@ burg , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings at the trial will continue on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard St@@ ables additional 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the ongoing recruitment plant for three years , Computer Science will build further jobs at the spl@@ itting of the company . &quot;
the vac@@ ancies at the US @-@ Computer @-@ H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) will not find an end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 places in its corporate clients . &quot;
&quot; this will save costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2,@@ 4 billion euros ) , distributed the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a nominal value of about $ 2.7 billion , which will fall into the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for the past three years . &quot;
&quot; HP Velotechnik in the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 still around 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
Reg@@ ulations gave the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share 2,@@ 3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the independent company from the Califor@@ ni@@ an Pal@@ o Alto is currently on : so , the computer and print business will be bund@@ led in a new company - separate from the relevant areas with computer servers and data store for companies and other services . &quot;
both business units are to be noted on the stock market .
&quot; a again betra@@ yed PC market as well as a weak@@ est demand from corporate clients after its services , on the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Len@@ ovo last . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of July the sales of PC and printing presses went by 1@@ 1,5 per cent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25@@ ,@@ 4 billion .
thus the proceeds went back into 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responded with a split and massive job car@@ esses on the changes in the industry .
the 76 year old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded late that customers can buy devices and tablets instead of traditional computers and are getting more and more shops at the same time .
&quot; Whit@@ man restructuring plans a total of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot;

24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non @-@ violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have pushed refugees to the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ as@@ nar@@ as and throwing several hundreds of displaced persons .

time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. staff
&quot; the world ob@@ serves , when the U.S. staff is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80@@ econom@@ ists who were asked by Re@@ uters found that the F@@ ed will do this last week , that the F@@ ed will continue to do that and the interest rates on the current status of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will last . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on N@@ U@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank could potentially leaves the zero section and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; Angel U@@ bi@@ de , director of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ lli@@ on dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs suggest that chances are good for such a step . &quot;
the decision should be issued at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death penalty at the Delta State University rejected ap@@ ologi@@ zing
&quot; after the sho@@ ot@@ ted and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later got his colleague on the day , he wrote Sh@@ annon &apos;s a note to say that he &quot; &quot; do not &quot; &quot; of the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that , Lec@@ turer for Geo@@ graphy and socio @-@ scientific formation at the Delta State University , calling the emergency telephone number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , he shot at someone and killed someone . &quot;
&quot; it also said the member of the emergency rule , that police police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I got my wife yesterday evening , and he also mentioned that a &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but he will not distur@@ b &quot; &quot; but probably excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the rebellion of his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
he gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police , the scene arose , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , who said , I am sorry I could und@@ o it . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , he drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he ow@@ ane Schmidt , a professor for history , killed before he eventually took his own life on Monday night , as polic@@ eman bu@@ gged him . &quot;
&quot; universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said he is nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Presentation . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the latter said that Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s had also been a relationship with Schmidt , told authorities on Tuesday , there are no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ ad relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who told she was about seven years married as a &quot; good human . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were p@@ ie@@ fied at the age of 15 years ago , but they were friends . &quot;
&quot; said O &apos; Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s would have been a daughter who is 19 and had destroyed them on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends .
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s worked online from home , according to statement by L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s . &quot;
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s who possessed a dog called Light@@ ning did she met for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help others , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , He inv@@ oked relatives at a certain point on Monday to say to them , &quot; he do not go into prison . &quot;
&quot; as polic@@ emen him on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , later in that night , he drove his car to the side , fled by walking , ran into the woods and killed itself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; he received a PhD in the spring of 2015 by the Delta State University , how to show his life @-@ style on the website of the university . &quot;
stars that have lost their luck
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner in Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
the actor has also supposedly fought with drugs and in 2008 he was condemned for drug ownership .
all this surely calls for its toll .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play every month due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
&quot; while this has brought the left defense def@@ ender to the wine and exclude it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give hope that Sha@@ w can play in this season again . &quot;
&quot; this injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area . &quot;
he was treated nine minutes on the board field and needed oxygen before it was brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double t@@ apping and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will then be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then performed in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then playing fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had a oxygen @-@ mask on .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
&quot; Moreno seemed lucky , a red card and the im@@ position of a mo@@ meter escape . &quot;
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian Ar@@ bit@@ er had not mist@@ aken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , when I say that an El@@ f@@ eter and a red card were due . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; read a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws Account , &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I will go back more strongly . &quot;
here : Manchester United they suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat of the PS@@ V
&quot; &quot; &quot; the England De@@ fen@@ ders has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the next June . &quot;
Philli@@ p Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaving the place with this type of injury are all very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure an opponent .
&quot; Moreno suffered a break @-@ off , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ stro &apos;s team at the 2014 World Cup 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he is very hard , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that there is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who was travelling in another direction , so it looked like he &apos;d touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Moreno : &quot; I know how hard it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very badly with me . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - according to a F@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ r@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a thing that all parents learn soon : when your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book was decided to tell the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ bearer environmental monitoring of Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to pre @-@ read my children because it always seems to have missed a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the next paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book , instead a summ@@ ation of the movie version of 2012 re@@ generates , the new characters and details added to the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; amid the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a good , met a boy named Ted , ful@@ fills the girl of his dreams by reading their desire to see a real tree , whose correct name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage was sil@@ enced , and the 1991 was totally unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not be susp@@ ici@@ ously enough : the text played by Cameron reads as part of the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie filmed on the website of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to his prag@@ matic Father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is not familiar with the book of the book so little . here is an un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the gre@@ edy Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ eing , kn@@ itted beings , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees &quot; , &quot; desol@@ ate . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times a row by a child .
a Down@@ ing Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s constitu@@ ency .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ son , but gave no further direct comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you chose the cad@@ res , which has chosen England for the tour , is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series of defeat not available on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ raft page is probably less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful and positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball evol@@ ves mos@@ ques Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size to test level , is an option for attack . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th turns out of the England test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his boss @-@ trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ player is oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I told this - player to choose their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , he could have been extended by Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully beat further rounds for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Mor@@ t@@ iss praised his attitude , although he did not give so good benefits , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test stroke will get to put his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th was given seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son , before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine was nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance for do @-@ it and back@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England initially appeared in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in peak form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a p@@ lip which I treasure high .
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he met 2@@ 36 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which met us very well . &quot;
&quot; it must receive at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the cre@@ pan@@ de@@ position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to make Mo@@ een next to Cook , which will make an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler while providing four o@@ des , emerged , and I have nothing to do against it . &quot;
&quot; I do not see why a p@@ lip can not hit there , and this link@@ age has already shown that he is a devil @-@ shot of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; maybe his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire has not been completed , but is it a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my previous team colleague J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop , before he joined in 2001 as Open@@ er . &quot;
he immediately managed and looked back three hundred feet .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari came to the cad@@ re as a Back @-@ up sp@@ inner that he has impressed me as a young man as a young man .
&quot; people may face their stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of back@@ ups that lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the crew , England has made some knowledgeable supplements for trainers . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela of Jay@@ uya , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience because under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously predicted . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , will not be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar pause against Australia and for my part I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but c@@ aches and team members do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must think that as with players will depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are made not light heart .

foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at and said , some member states , so deeply moved into various crises , as the EU is now and not always from own debt , Britain itself presented the agenda with tense @-@ conc@@ essions and disturbing conclusion that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Brigh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided in her annual meeting that it might not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; prime minister and finance minister climb at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of yourself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they will win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants to look for outside the UK meeting in the inside of the EU tent - &quot; &quot; don &apos;t want to say that alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and can be passed through , that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted minister and officials come up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we remain or walk . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s careful chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to take office before it looks bad for them , as it does in the exagger@@ ated length such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande can look back at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ ending power .
Poland could soon have a nation@@ alistic legal government in Spain a lef@@ tist .
&quot; it is hard to imag@@ ining that it should be a lead to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to prevent their energy better , Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK too - something that they also do not want , because most similar , separ@@ ati@@ st trends have . &quot;
&quot; so perhaps some such ministers may even notice some helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P @-@ style , during the British referendum in 2017 , to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , realised my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt , and &quot; Great Britain has not gained anything of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how r@@ ally the fle@@ ets can be at their expense and which EU @-@ scep@@ tic is the oligar@@ chy of the Press@@ eb@@ ar@@ one , as it was not being inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspir@@ ational lecture ( 1975 ) but did not support our entry in 1973 by a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they may rec@@ oll@@ ect themselves to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who has made a name for themselves as an &quot; &quot; EU Ger@@ ade &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; it belonged to the med@@ ley of tax @-@ thir@@ sts , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners , and the pseu@@ do non @-@ Indians , who have most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair is thinking about her , but he found that when you &apos;re sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of being too his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as Blair himself , when he resist@@ ed Cam@@ er@@ ors Spe@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ wir@@ t , because NATO had rejected the EU &apos;s not adopted by French and Dutch voters which then opened to him by a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never betra@@ yed him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster a friendly se@@ per@@ ched on his back - I told him that he has no time for me to waste water - seems to repeat itself in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ boy@@ cott Mur@@ ten strategy of the 80 @-@ er years , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n official position towards Europe is - I simply put it in a friendly way - in the development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU . &quot;
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ sk Tenden@@ cy and the wild bo@@ ils of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may well say everybody else . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A naming , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said , when the boy Sc@@ out was in it , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of provo@@ ke John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow cler@@ l had a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father lay his efforts on television to go loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet without losing far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow @-@ members and representatives to all the reports on their clause on Monday evening . &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline stays in the age of TV all around the clock and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media ; a Brut@@ ite of Par@@ ano@@ ia and Ver@@ rat .
&quot; it is right , Cameron do not give an extra @-@ card for Europe that allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the speech campaign for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins really thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ ui@@ ties - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ iz@@ ational Economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left disper@@ sing , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ dis@@ m of the small semi @-@ decisive dispute is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ low@@ ly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to withdrawal - will be committed to finding foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find out in all a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin be wast@@ ing political capital - they also have bad elec@@ torate - to make conc@@ essions to the British when it can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost of under@@ lining the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start of Monday , which was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes was less harmful than qu@@ itting from a meeting of 12 persons , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et in opening to critic@@ ise the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ hic ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
&quot; phe published the &quot; &quot; Basis Report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the load@@ ability of the data and directed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial written in the medical journal of Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ate foundation &quot; on the p@@ hic up his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked if the claims &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical epidemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expects that the current best estimate is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than qu@@ itting , based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decisions ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria sy Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to lead their opinions about the damage of various nicotine products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose executive director had previously been awarded by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report as they said .
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not financing that he received after reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um will not be delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a range of industries . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco @-@ direction took part .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ hic report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of p@@ hic reported that &quot; there has so far no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers serve . &quot;
&quot; prof Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ hic , said that at the back of BM@@ J was already re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggest that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to them are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact . &quot;
&quot; phe has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence has been evidence of and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0.000 people annually die of a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ a year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear pre@@ tension of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes is not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders says a former chief of Channel 4
&quot; former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said , the BBC should cease to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that broad@@ cast@@ ers should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ casting stations .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making them public @-@ legal programmes , which are probably seen by a smaller public , in hard cont@@ ested time window against the popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ itters such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Direc@@ torate , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted more to do in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has been trying to contact the BBC for six years with the BBC in his time . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs were commissioned or sends , which were clearly demonstrated by un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broad@@ casting fee , what I think medium or long term are not for a good idea , one should not make his production at least on programs that others do not do or provide . &quot;
&quot; you send The Voice in a first @-@ rate schedule , because they want to achieve as broad support for their future as possible . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous ; it is of course nonsense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ ression tax programs financed which could also be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , admitt@@ edly both re@@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm to them . &quot;
I am trying to see how this should be public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a company for series , who led the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s blame for evaluations may be &quot; due to the ambitions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; its comments on the most popular shipments of BBC give the again , what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ conference presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 , proposed that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where one can rather measure the audience , and they can argue if they approach to their apparent holy missions for the justification of 4 billion euros of broad@@ casting , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ struc@@ tions programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them into a window in which nobody ever wanted to see .
&quot; comm@@ a to broad@@ casting , Johnson said to the Committee . &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can be the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think we &apos;re thinking that one receives a great value for 150 l@@ bs each year , but for those who have a lot of money for the 150 l@@ bs , ask me if this is true , because they consume not much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who was also audi@@ tioned in front of the Committee on Tuesday , asking for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to form and to entertain . &quot;
&quot; he said , little bit of BBC @-@ production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.@@ 1 % on radio . and it should be part of public @-@ legal channels in Australia and Canada , and this example will change this in &quot; &quot; inform &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date and entertain . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of TV will be shown , and with the commercial channel alliances in order to make everything online available . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ Get &apos; can control brain cells by sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des changes direction in the moment in which it will be illuminated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by spec@@ ulators of sound waves .
&quot; tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they have to be heard with sound impul@@ ses , which should be heard for the human hearing at high frequencies in order to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impulses work through the inser@@ tion of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ultras@@ ound waves . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ Get , using ultras@@ ound in order to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells out of the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of the stimulation of the Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; nu@@ is@@ ers usually do not respond to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it , if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ ound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultras@@ ound waves are based on structures that can be called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms cells .
&quot; sound waves make an opening of these deposits , and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as Nature Communications . &quot;
in order to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des changed Hal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ e TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels have to be arranged .
&quot; if it applies ultras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound @-@ waves are strengthened through the micro@@ sw@@ ans and transferred into wor@@ ms , where it is shut down the changed mot@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the process has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ Point , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to con@@ turn neur@@ ons with impulses of light and switch off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Get some benefits to this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that needs to be sent in an optical fiber to the required position in the brain , Ni@@ ed@@ ul@@ ence ultras@@ ound tissues can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the disgu@@ ised human ne@@ ons temporarily to make the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical attitude to certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; Hal@@ as@@ ani said . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative Le@@ ver was amazed by the silence that reigned around advertising for the weapon fair - by creating an empt@@ ying of the Excel calendar , and thought : &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising , but &quot; thanks to the blu@@ ish of light colors and animation , it remains even more important . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us shar@@ pen the awareness of selling illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nest@@ y . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a proceeding of the British government and the guarantee that Fol@@ ders are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door . &quot;

eight golden rules for student life
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ away 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormitory , still in the belief in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense sm@@ iles , who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , prot@@ ag@@ ous complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned may be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the ind@@ eli@@ ke in student residence ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it is entic@@ ing too ashamed : people tell you , where you get , whether and where you are Sab@@ b@@ ite , where you are in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in the Ernst , guys , there is just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make your questions and show you interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were shot in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people offer people .
&quot; the rooms of people often transform themselves into drinks , film night venues and local meet points , but they are also the places where people attract and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
here referred to : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ sp@@ ection is given a ru@@ de treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but a lot of school residences make up a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ stroll @-@ culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this may be hell for anyone who tries to rec@@ u@@ perate .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continues , but you have to go away so that I may get the energy I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a rel@@ ent@@ one is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos : do it .
&quot; a guy in my dor@@ ms , had the idea that a has@@ n &apos;t a closed door was an invitation . &quot;
he saw some things .
close friendship through B@@ aking .
&quot; start the university at the peak of the back @-@ Man@@ ie , the clo@@ ister is to present itself with the doors of people , to present yourself with a dish full of brow@@ nies , somewhat strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I made you something baked . so , and now please smile as I present to you some personal questions . &quot;
&quot; to offer home @-@ made delicacies , is a good way to make friends . &quot;
your room@@ mates are obligated to entertain yourself and will end up your face with a delicious surprise .
naturally this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
&quot; bad cl@@ umps from fl@@ our , sugar and fat lead to that people ask themselves sleeping , when they leave . &quot;
ste@@ al food is a regular crime in student &apos;s homes .
&quot; of course , the sounds of chickens is a rob@@ ber@@ y , but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
please check that with the owner @-@ owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use yourself , even if they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; if any one ste@@ als your stuff is the annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who put an agent in order to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
it is now in prison .
they should not make noise from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people that sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , whether it was giving them something , Drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it had three am in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they react with even more traditional music .
&quot; when she finally heard about 5 p.m. , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and ended up her three @-@ hour exam . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would take place acci@@ dentally in the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely it would not be dist@@ res@@ sing when you co @-@ hold a room@@ mate for your future wife , to join them again , and then experience it every day and perhaps experience how they moved all common friends to themselves ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but when a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try at least to talk to your under@@ dog a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its key in its not locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Bul@@ lying as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is fun , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place through plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never give somebody &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ am@@ po@@ o .
shut down your door and place their keys in a glass of water that you then put in the freezer - but do not grab their possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
&quot; terr@@ aced for refugees , de@@ pl@@ ating , cont@@ ing@@ ful , &quot;
true shareholders Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building in the middle @-@ Turkish corner stone houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; therefore about refugees - but also as a signal , &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the alone mother and the righteous . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to build a cheap and well @-@ being today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the residential market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how fast living space can be created : it builds in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will be driven into the market market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or trainers has no sustainability .
for people stay at a great deal here .
&quot; in the light of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient housing in the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; one whole , three @-@ story @-@ story @-@ house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a char@@ a house needs the least amount of space .
it facilitates the integration .
this is different if you refrain from people in living blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three dwell@@ ings for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily according to the specific needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the building took six months to build .
this is appropriate .
have the building rules complicated their plans ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : &quot; &quot; legally , I have pulled my project correctly . &quot;
especially complicated it makes it always the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ ky special structure and the Stell@@ er@@ sion Reg@@ ulations .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ estimated , who creates three apartments in a row @-@ house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is there that is no place for that .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the local people react to their Rei@@ h@@ House project ?

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Un@@ update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by typing the app , in &quot; General and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are met after the installation on issues , since it receives an error message that communic@@ ates that the &quot; &quot; software update was lacking . &quot;
&quot; to deal with the problem , users is advised to either wait until the crowds goes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may possibly mean the deletion of apps to make space - but Apple has made it easier by tigh@@ tening the updates un@@ probable . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you want to delete a special tool and then re @-@ install it once the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worth considering that your mobile phone is loaded during the update , or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the cargo is too low , Apple does not leave that the update goes on half way off , and this could lead to a break@@ up of the updates . &quot;

&quot; witnesses asks the police for a case in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mu@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were travelling by foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mu@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one of the group , a 17 years old new Afgh@@ ans , followed according to the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them to wait for him . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ pet@@ rol station . &quot;
there are also three persons on the site of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men now scre@@ amed the young people , and this one with the f@@ ist to the face . &quot;
the victim suffered a nose @-@ blood and ble@@ eding strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends followed and settled on the bat un@@ res@@ ated , this initially caused by his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the promised young man was now being brought home . &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group by car up to their apartment and took up demonstrations several times .
&quot; when one did not see the vehicle one more , the remaining one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person .
under the rise of a stroke you test on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of his offering .
the wounded had to be taken to a hospital for the purpose of medical care .
&quot; so far , only a v@@ ague Daily description is before . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes care in the field and is investing approximately 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take on the practice by Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel rock .
&quot; furthermore , Sam@@ t@@ om@@ in@@ stig@@ ator Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promotion in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ f Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
doctors are missing in many places in the country - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field .
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ al ausen in retirement , her husband is standing by Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor in the next months still with half a position . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 again , until then he is investing 3@@ 10000 Euro into the premises at the St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy , at first glance , when Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently completed their professional san@@ itation in the event of hospital and will also get into practice in the same year . &quot;
&quot; we always had the mind that the garbage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I was inv@@ oked it . &quot;
in the couple Müller the idea came to operate in A@@ sen@@ dorf the own practice .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families about the years , &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot;
and so it was agreed that the garbage bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; Frank Müller , the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hanover , followed in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;

&quot; from September 19 , the practice for the new boss is being prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ lowship ausen as a pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian , his wife Ur@@ sel ( inter@@ ro@@ tin ) specialized on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the garbage cans , both inter@@ ne@@ es , would like to settle as a household . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after re@@ modeling the rooms are modern look .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and pay@@ load EC@@ GS and need a microphone @-@ room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;

&quot; this shows how proud and pleased we are that the practice will continue , &quot; stresses Sam@@ t@@ om@@ in@@ ers Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients come to the practice Fel@@ lowship in 2000 , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ berg , in the North German A@@ verage practice , there are approximately 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another assistant office .
a positive out@@ effect of the practice of practice by Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store remains in the Ur@@ sel Mountains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor would have found , it would have gone . &quot;
&quot; who attended the bag , is to be attended above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning of the field . &quot;
&quot; with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medi@@ cs have worked there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ir@@ mun@@ ching &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; so far I have always pressed ahead of garden work , now that could be different . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot;
&quot; now , the border controls will also be driven at our south @-@ border , &quot; said Interior Minister in Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel with it .
&quot; what is clear that everyone , who wants to make a asylum application , this can also &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stands in the foreground .
&quot; however , it is clear that there is clear signals , &quot; &quot; the prime minister said . &quot;
people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows - not at the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia en@@ rolled &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian Government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue its coming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances will establish corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not look like this . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ dors &quot; &quot; is absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; however , as the prime minister stressed that Slovenia wants to seal its border to refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system can not work , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees would have tried to pass in the night hours to Tuesday , in eastern Croatian on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to pass , to so@@ ften the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could take it up in the near fields of corn .
according to local media we ever met police vehicles with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also lif@@ ebo@@ ats and the Red Cross are already in action .
&quot; in the coming days its country is spent with around 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; also , buses from Pres@@ evo at the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border , the Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade ranks however that it may be that people suggest to make certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want this &quot; , &quot; it meant . &quot;
&quot; according to media reporting , at least in the morning a first bus arrived with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , during the day , more buses would expect . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had been away all night long from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary agreed , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; thus , it could actually be a predicted shift of the previous Balkan route to Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia to a somewhat further west . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed , that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible improvements in refugees in the case of a strong flow of refugees . &quot;
&quot; details he did not , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member , &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
one leads strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , with the EU partners on a good witness to the country , as regards the standards of border controls . &quot;
on Serbian side we are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence a total of about 300 refugees .
&quot; according to Belgrade , they had reported the past night on the border crossing of Hor@@ a who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two bor@@ der@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic sought to put Mit@@ tw@@ asser from a locom@@ otive in Hor@@ gos : he will stop the debates on ageing processes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
it would not currently be a very high rate of refugee .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers : migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute refugees to the refugees , on which alternative routes are shown through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war - still not more spacious min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of de@@ mining was sent in the border region .
stock h@@ ackers : Ukrainian pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of Cyber@@ criminal criminal , which has been thrown back since 2010 to have an insight into still un@@ released financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire . &quot;
&quot; in fact , insi@@ der information should be done on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , investig@@ ators have reported a total of over 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; says it in the S@@ EC communication . &quot;
the trials against 32 further accus@@ ations in the case were perpet@@ u@@ ated .
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators will have operated both in the USA and Eastern Europe .

&quot; it &apos;s all life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; the guidance of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ aid is also available for questions and talks , as for the volunteers . &quot;

therefore this public is good action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old good .
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to open to the tables , however , it is understandable , ultimately it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the issue of death and dying is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , thus the experience of Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer , who just had contributed much to the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years that people open . &quot;

&quot; through personal experience with the issue , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; as the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ aid was asked by an appeal of volunteers , she immediately reported it and was it in the foundation in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ des@@ roid is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the subject and depend@@ ents in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hosp@@ ice . &quot;
all are they carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ g@@ roid can work well with their task and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , consider it precious and este@@ emed the moment , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex outcome mixed with financial outlook for 2016
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reported disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery gigs gain its profits first year because of the weak@@ est demand for cargo services and the higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ field service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she plans to recru@@ it about 5@@ 5,000 season workers for the holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to stop 50.000 seasonal workers for the period of vacation . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predic@@ tion . &quot;
an@@ alysts expected to say a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; despite the price increase , the average view comes in spite of the price increase , average of 4.@@ 9 percent will be effective on January 4 and in spite of higher cr@@ ates for bo@@ d@@ areas of heavy and large packages which will be lifted up from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that nevertheless , the result is expected to increase the profit from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of the growth in the online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; solid income yields &quot; &quot; if one pul@@ ls the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for vacation jobs have been announced a day later than that of the Rival U@@ PS , which is planning 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour power , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million earned , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at $ 2.1 $ per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;

&quot; in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has made a decline at international Pri@@ ority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express delivery . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales grew by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express @-@ unit has a higher income due to higher prices , while the result exceeded because of higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , reaching the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2,5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th . &quot;
&quot; on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spent two days down this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni &apos;s table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the guiding principle . &quot;
&quot; dor@@ m@@ ant over them at an end of the past , two @-@ story sitting agenda is a mur@@ ky of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues will set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a triple order from Congress : maximize the US jobs and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed guides have recognised that there has been a failed third @-@ third mandate : financial stability .
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be cured by an unprecedented stim@@ ul@@ ant interest since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that they grow solid , recent turbul@@ ences in the global financial markets make an already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to reinforce these vol@@ ati@@ lity through the raising of the interest rate for federal union - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labor market and inflation is primarily the most important thing that they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist in the Mak@@ ler@@ company of Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ etta &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification , continued to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what is sufficient in itself the financial market .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been asked from Bloomberg Jo@@ in , have predicted that week to place this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets expect a decline of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator @-@ indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decrease in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the Str@@ ate@@ gen cuts the blow by promising that a further increase is distant . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value is about 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or a 1.4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds a sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Princip@@ al at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you do it , it would have to go far away in their declaration to re@@ assure the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a cement of financial markets would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the in@@ security of when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percent@@ ages in this month , the first little step towards a slow tigh@@ tening of the mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had been in spring and early summer , that this year , despite the discomfort of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the job creation is des@@ slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate sank from 5.5 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage gains have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although the inflation continued steadily under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary action of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Princip@@ al at the Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but at the end of the last month financial markets , the financial markets brought together its currency to the end of the world . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average worth more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ ing of the Chinese economy would be the global growth of th@@ rot@@ tles . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered a little this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the high temperature of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation , when one can increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy have not appeared in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. staff . &quot;
&quot; now , he is saying that they will wait at least a month to get the effects better under control . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority of the world has become .
in recent years the influence of the central bank was enormous .
&quot; the mere reference of the then leader of Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be its mon@@ th@@ ary expansion &quot; narrow &quot; , &quot; miserable confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly connected with one another , the F@@ ed representatives are expected not only to super@@ v@@ ise developments at other locations but also consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , revealed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements , which apparently not associated with the economical foundations . &quot;
&quot; acker , constitu@@ tive member of the Federal Open Market Committee , dedicated to an inser@@ tion multip@@ lication , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as example . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest to 0.@@ 75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; , &quot; despite limited recogni@@ ze@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives were revers@@ ed these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put on the first place aspects of financial stability only during a heavy crisis such as the market collaboration in 2008 , said Adam S. Posen , former member of the Committee on the interest rates of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; recent turbul@@ ences come not close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it will certainly not get into the situation where they are afraid of an inser@@ tion , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said Posen , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act always contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t believe that it should be the time ahead . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany for these days .
receiving a warm welcome is not without the dedication of inn@@ um@@ erable volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ - there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is with body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 lungs they are still being taught .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse .

&quot; of course , the whole of other classes is considered to be at the right school . &quot;
Brazi@@ li@@ mp@@ atric Company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy l@@ les
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to clear on how important good nutrition during the breast@@ feeding period is . it does this with the presentation of images of babies , which are to be painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment to make the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively impact the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new am@@ ber sports hall
the Federal Republic Bern@@ ini approved the construction contract for the 2,@@ 3 million Euros expensive sports hall . &quot;
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar bo@@ iling .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited rail construction at am@@ ber &apos;s sports area come step by step forward : in the youngest coun@@ cill@@ ors meeting was agreed without great discussions apart .
&quot; before , the Panel had another request to establish a degra@@ dation &quot; &quot; respectable &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from a valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; exception , &quot; it was about permission for a special design on the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; Satt@@ el@@ d@@ ach &quot; &quot; should be built with non @-@ wheel@@ ed First and Dach@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the background of the planning is the intended use of the umbrella for solar plants : &quot; &quot; this is how we get together a wonderfully large South dd@@ ach , &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the session . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; liberation &quot; it was again about the sky@@ line that is prescribed for energy reasons - other than in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan concerning the bow position does not allow &quot; exceptions &quot; - the am@@ ber of the community as a rule in terms of liber@@ ations , is rather restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; however , for the sne@@ e@@ cho@@ es , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ence , &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the sports building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and of S@@ V Bern@@ ese .
the costs of around 2.8 million Euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected from the shoulder and the transport promotion .
in the next process of procedure the construction contract for the 18 x 36 meter high hall is now presented to the country residence to the examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new medical director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station and the majority of the employees are drawn from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; these see the surprising plans of hospital GmbH of the Land@@ circle , before the Land@@ tra@@ tin Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on the resign@@ ations of the Supervisory Board , and the Board of Directors of the coming Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees will continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority were to walk with fishermen and the further existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the staff who do not meet with Sch@@ ong@@ au , is to be offered in W@@ eil@@ heim an workplace , so Jo@@ chner . &quot;
the employees are informed of their plans .
&quot; triggered the change from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the year &apos;s medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and now moved to a private office in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; when the question of who is to attend the succession , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play according to Jo@@ chner , who is prepared to take over the leadership of October 1 , and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; in each case the &quot; &quot; valuation &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; then Jo@@ chner , white . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ oul@@ ders and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inside station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; in passing , for the next two years , Fischer has to agree with his team , when the Supervisory Board will agree to both houses , until then next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ship , which has even more than 35 beds , has finally been shut down after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the country had planned this for 2018 , if the currently running re@@ organization at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim was completed . &quot;
&quot; Sal@@ chner Jo@@ chner , who is also President of the Supervisory Board , joined rum@@ ors , after which the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ federation , will in the future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; I would like to close it . as it goes with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not tell , it may give several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a spa @-@ care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ p sy@@ ph@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what Bet@@ ter could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; says Fischer over the Qu@@ asi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who had been taken by the employees &quot; positively and very understanding . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has been working as a boss for over 30 years now . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the handic@@ ra@@ fts of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lion are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 am ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
&quot; the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal the clear favorite , cause for arro@@ gan@@ ce , but none . &quot;
in the last season the s@@ wimm@@ ers held on B@@ HC a painful defeat and have a good condition to purchase there .
Jag@@ at with two of the past at Pr@@ at@@ au
two traction drivers have been severely in@@ jured during their ma@@ is@@ harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
&quot; during the super@@ se@@ ap@@ tion on a Ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district of Witt@@ enberg ) , there were several hunters in the effort , like the police . &quot;
&quot; after a disp@@ ensing , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year old man suffered severe injuries and were brought in hospitals . &quot;
how exactly it could come to the accident I didn &apos;t seem .
the police police are determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violence
the police have led the police to have suffered from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate since Saturday .
&quot; in the trial , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old were killed , the young people were killed and their corp@@ ses were cast into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
one already missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is a swe@@ ep to a victim .
&quot; the corp@@ se of the young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the Prosec@@ utor and police stayed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as suspected , one also applies at the service sp@@ read@@ ed 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who in fact indicate the indication , and the investig@@ ator lead to finding a place of bodies . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday mor@@ nings , after she had come back home on the eve of a convention in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
in finding the young woman investig@@ ators first had personal items of his offering .
&quot; with surveys in the friend@@ ships and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the Ver@@ mi@@ sts , finally a crime was made up against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the mut@@ ine@@ al perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police to a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found . &quot;
&quot; the celebration gave the authorities in police inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , who killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and have put the body in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be carried out on Wednesday to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter , the investig@@ ators put the twi@@ light on the load . &quot;
an agreement on the closer conditions of action shall bring the further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns before housing .
the situation on the German market is tense .
even more refugees trying to pay an affordable one .
the pressure on the apartment market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution competitions in the German housing market have long since began .
&quot; with the coming refugees and working people from the EU , more and more people push for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many cities . &quot;
they compete with a weak citizens about the last pre@@ paid apartments .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , would have to be built between 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; to this end , there is a study conducted on behalf of the association &quot; social housing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to compare , more than this year are sold 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units . &quot;
this makes 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
&quot; refugees are no longer comm@@ ited for the first three months of their stay , seeking asylum seekers in an initial submission . &quot;
many of them encounter the apartment market and are located in the long sn@@ akes in front of the flats .
&quot; according to statistics of statistics , less than half of all asylum seekers stayed in the year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is due not only to the increasing numbers of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in housing policy for the past years .
Germany remains a housing deficit in front of itself that is bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently , in the metropolitan areas , around 77@@ ,000 housing units , did Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many artists were therefore noted in big cities and are penet@@ rated into WG rooms .
&quot; young adults stayed in@@ definitely in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; &quot; because of the clut@@ ches on the apartment market . &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the &quot; social housing &quot; is propos@@ ing a restart . &quot;
thereby new incentives should boost social housing construction again .
in this way could the di@@ under@@ world tax could be avoided and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed apartments will be exposed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the alliance is necessary to provide attractive fiscal harmon@@ isation options . &quot;
the support programme for refugee @-@ accommodation of the state bank Kf@@ W is already working well in towns and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start was rec@@ alled by 184 million euros , at the end of the evening at the end of the evening . &quot;
now the project could even be opened .
refugees have a free money : Croatia and Slovenia establish corridor
&quot; the way to Hungary is practically nothing going through , there is more and more refugees Cho@@ ose the path across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to negotiate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia over the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian interior and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; after the cr@@ ot@@ age of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws , which occurred on the same day came into force , are practically superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees to pass .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic : &quot; they can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity .
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who do not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the morning .
&quot; the most recent media report is made from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with the bus as well as with Ta@@ xes in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after her arrival , she tried to walk through the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not encounter on the border fence . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the bor@@ ro@@ am holds other dangers . there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
min@@ de@@ mining should now create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , almost more refugees arrive to Hungary following the closure of the limit . &quot;
on Tuesday the police reported 3@@ 66 were attacked .
shortly before the deadline on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws steps the overcoming and damage of the border agreement to us as a crime .
in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged therefore 35 criminal procedures have been initiated .
the quar@@ rel wre@@ ath up to five years and exp@@ ulsion from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday , in the newly at the border &quot; &quot; Tran@@ si@@ r &quot; &quot; 94 were taken up , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees to be stopped .
&quot; practically , no one has affor@@ ded a view to get asylum in Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; in the opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ er are supposed to get shi@@ el@@ ded there .
in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to stir .
&quot; they collected the trash , the tens of thousands of people in the past weeks left at the road@@ side . &quot;
pl@@ ywood have been eliminated and one of the acc@@ ager in the bor@@ der@@ site was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself for the purpose of this change .
Austria reaches a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants lasted still in the country , but still in the country . &quot;
around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany about 1400 people .
the rail traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
An@@ un@@ ner met smaller groups of refugees on foot regularly .
Mayor launched the &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ ged &quot; over the border
&quot; we were occupied after the bridge on Sunday with the elevator , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the celebration at the entrance of the celebration , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ ut Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany had set surprising rail traffic with Austria because of the refugee flow of railway traffic with Austria , he was immediately informed in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler who immediately drew its help and for@@ ested the bases together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before , we did not once disgu@@ sts the un@@ conce@@ aled guests , with j@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we take them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; so town@@ ship in the O@@ Ö@@ N . &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; a man did not let it take , to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire department . &quot;
&quot; this has enjoyed us very much , &quot; &quot; so town@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; the stran@@ ded train schedules were raised on Sunday evening in Wels by an ICE in a regional train direction Pass@@ au to make it after the short notice , that the railway traffic was stopped after Germany , but still trying to try the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was abol@@ ished in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able and organised a two @-@ brid@@ ging business - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending more z@@ ig@@ es to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures , our Chancellor continued to be highly advanced and publicly co @-@ ordin@@ ated the position of the Hungarian government in the National Socialism of National Socialism . &quot;
Un@@ d@@ tra@@ iling these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are facing off in the border areas with chaotic states .
&quot; the refugees also have to find that the &quot; &quot; ob@@ ased land &quot; &quot; which they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the nearby winter , in order to make decent conditions for protective seeking protection . &quot;
and there will be one more larger - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad at the lookout for 3@@ 5.000 winter fixed quarters
&quot; finally , with the refugee @-@ signed &quot; &quot; Konrad has fully to do with the refugee @-@ signed hands . &quot;
Christian Konrad is acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to her word weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen ban@@ ker to exp@@ ose a sc@@ iss@@ ors for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; already , the chaos in the initial centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been able to get a grip on . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless shel@@ ters in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; although the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday had come to Austria without a great vor@@ tex , Konrad Adenauer and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior said , on the other hand , said of a &quot; crisis @-@ related situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; reveals Konrad with an need of 8@@ 5,000 quart@@ z in the he@@ ur@@ ful year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number we have to be found 3@@ 5.000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20,000 the lands are delivering , 15@@ ,000 of the covenant . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a bott@@ om@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the general cent@@ uri@@ ons he has already conducted interviews .
&quot; these could have been granted to him , even for the coming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works fine , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to explain how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations , the asylum coordin@@ ator also continues into the OR@@ F action &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot; &quot;
on the platform you can offer private persons uncomplicated accommodations .
&quot; in addition , one hopes that hotels in winter will be empty . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed yesterday the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Not@@ ting times it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ len@@ ders have to respect a certain height of the hand@@ tu@@ ffs or the size of the faul@@ ty .
for a temporary period would have to apply &quot; Not@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; that he is more successful in the opposition to the Department of Interior , with his experience . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentl@@ eman , whom one cannot say without further into the face of the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause any costs , as they av@@ owed themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their head@@ count on three to four .
the own dates of duty was still not successful until now .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz .
but there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz demands better sharing
&quot; it is not an opening of urban sports halls , and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for keeping refugees planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , this is not necessary since one could manage the affected people without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
but further locations are to be checked for emergency relief .
criticism of the city shall judge by the division of refugees within the state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not blin@@ ded &quot;
in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) hosted the general statement in the refugee question on Monday .
se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ass@@ ures me that the German borders are not sealed .
continuing the return of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany shall be possible .
&quot; however , there are now the appropriate border controls . &quot;
special elev@@ ators with refugees to Germany will not be given any more .
but the protective search would however have brought with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ens@@ inger had once more increased solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria has again entered its borders again into its borders , is a logical consequence of &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; of the procedures of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; the General@@ ate of the &quot; &quot; New Wor@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial Center is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production building , the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T has weigh@@ ted , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meter ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the supplier area . &quot;
&quot; in IT the clever minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ chief Hannes lower . &quot;
he could imagine to invest in Start@@ up @-@ companies of the New Wor@@ ship@@ yard and later on which to ac@@ qui@@ ver .
&quot; already from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which precip@@ itation promises a lot : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.@@ 7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.@@ 4.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Confederation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is p@@ onder@@ ed by the Linz AG for 60 years an S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meters of resi@@ dual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it inquiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ a opened a second shop in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are in the centre .
&quot; actually , J@@ utta wanted to get to gain a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to catch the 49 year @-@ old in@@ let of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the be@@ et market for short @-@ catching up , and finally she has now being watch@@ ful in the form of another commercial location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la store opposite the shop , where they sold among other pockets , suitcase , shoes and spices of various manufacturers , are now all about Dam@@ age @-@ hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 Euro . &quot;
big pockets and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously several weeks has been re@@ developed .
&quot; but I have long over@@ looked , if I want to open a shop , &quot; says broadly . &quot;
&quot; the decision was decisive for the decision , among other things that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home from the idea of a dedicated location , in which only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the emp@@ t in the Greater Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been wide from her mother in the cradle .
I emerged most when something develops and I can show new trends in terms of performance .
&quot; so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , on duty , the professional lady cannot answer the last security . &quot;
perhaps it &apos;s because a nice bag disp@@ osed of each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ lier .
&quot; this property also communic@@ ates with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the U.S. president . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always for good @-@ off .
&quot; whether he has manifested himself xen@@ opho@@ bia , journalists or scientists in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. Office wir@@ led the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts fine with it .
&quot; this is also registered at the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the real estate has come out . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ ur is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf by the wine road a term .
maneu@@ ver in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant place is related via -@@ four corners with it .
&quot; his grand@@ si@@ re came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ ine : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in an electoral mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ ine Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do vill@@ agers think about its aim to become the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think that &apos;s somehow exciting , but in their cold style , they are not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native of K@@ all@@ ine tan@@ ker has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous sprinkl@@ ers to which at Tru@@ mp also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ est@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also in word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in Cas@@ all@@ city . &quot;
he did not put it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; while there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to be mind@@ ful that Tru@@ mp &quot; is already a bit of a big w@@ alled &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dently the nick@@ name , the Car@@ all@@ stadt in the Vic@@ inity , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too high @-@ German : the len@@ ders , says it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is thus out of the village of the len@@ ders .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos; sche &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather was emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a local tavern for the min@@ er . &quot;
fundament@@ als of the real estate company were first property purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy : your desire to return to the country in the long run , forced by the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was back then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he once rejected it without permission , the director of the Institute for Ex@@ cal@@ ary History and folk ology , Roland Paul , was declared film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the occasionally marked statements of the replic@@ as .
&quot; he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States , and called for the construction of a boundary wall to deter@@ red illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; just as the pol@@ em@@ ing , that is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relatives ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born @-@ in @-@ Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
the win@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer has re@@ tired the Americans rather dist@@ ancing . &quot; he is always so br@@ acing .
do he believes that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ wir@@ t Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ram@@ m men@@ tions as man@@ made k@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz lived on a visit something for the church organ , which generally well anchor . &quot;
&quot; this can I not imagine the Donald &apos;s , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they open it better if he doesn &apos;t know that choice , for &quot; &quot; he has such a radical view , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who were at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been such as he , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ a Sarah Sarah . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ linger movie , for the Tru@@ mp long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 ru@@ o@@ ers , even in the USA is awakening interest . &quot;
the Upper Bav@@ arian community Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ citizen @-@ village in the National Park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den received the award for mild tourism . &quot;
there are already 20 &quot; mountain villages in Austria . &quot;
in the neighboring country the local Alpine Club is responsible for the award of the award .
a &quot; mountain apart &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be exp@@ elled as a protective area .
&quot; s Sunrise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra , to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has no major port@@ ations in the product reviews . &quot;
the breakfast show of Nine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the Bundes@@ Capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ shows the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .

&quot; this disadvantage of the condition seemed to play no part for Australian TV spectators , as Sunrise @-@ average 39@@ ,000 spectators have achieved in the five main cities , in comparison to the today 3@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last months today the gap to sunrise was closed .
&quot; in August Today at the average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sunrise today . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the gap between 40@@ ,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September sunrise at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators have been at the average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happened every morning .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Serial star of Power@@ to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recently wit@@ ted father , who exclu@@ des himself to settle with his two children at the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot;
critics were asked whether Thom@@ son was able to take a hit show solo without the giant Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and proposed slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new Quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ K@@ ee@@ fe adds on average 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) sp@@ rang out at 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ del@@ hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the evening , the first half hour of The Chase is 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour trail 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average , 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the drop with the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Chase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will end up at 17 : 30 .

&quot; the last three matches , Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ? &quot;
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ know@@ ingly obvious that The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally adm@@ its , was wrapped in biggest secrecy . &quot;
none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether it is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we arrive at Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you might be acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps its lips unto the finals on Thursday
&quot; all three women chose this ly@@ rical way of why Wood is the perfect man , and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is posed , &quot; If not you , who should receive the final rose ? &quot; &quot; could be their answers to death , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki recognised both quickly - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed since I felt it was quite compatible , and I thought it all over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the correct chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week you made clear that wood is &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condi@@ tionally focused on him , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , whom wood was to choose , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say this , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ loving girl alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the U.S. - and there were many other teams that were sent to us after his impressive out@@ pouring of the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some coaches had ban@@ ished Hay@@ es for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a cl@@ angel as he did about the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ tit during his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ es the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of imposing his R@@ ookies cup from the rest of the team by the grin@@ der , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ es also publicly during his press conference after the match .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams @-@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ gs him , his missed p@@ ang and to look after the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne , on a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first game quarters of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
it was certainly not the start to the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian Ge@@ iss@@ g@@ um for his N@@ FL debut album .
Hay@@ es left the playing field and told later the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ ton 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne betra@@ yed the car@@ vers with his Orig@@ in debut in the year 2007 when a passport conducted at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area at a T@@ ry in Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; party and frac@@ tion@@ ef Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger began at the beginning of the F@@ W in Fall of a heavy crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , if there is not a new teacher for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1,000 additional teacher to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get conv@@ ul@@ sions in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the lands of the Free voters are ch@@ ased so far to Friday in the Paris Commune .
&quot; actually , very other main themes . &quot;
but the record @-@ record of refugees also dominates the Free voters meeting .
&quot; of course the topic for asylum the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger he called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as she was in the n@@ ine@@ ties for the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push the free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts , which are responsible for asylum systems : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
the F@@ W leader critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistently reported : &quot; we fle@@ dged nationwide standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves , others do not . &quot;
&quot; there , we need to be able to become able to act . &quot;

but this is not far enough .
&quot; the topic of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want .
&quot; free travel at G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is desired . &quot;

the discussion about the bur@@ dens from the nuclear ph@@ as@@ upon has pushed the stocks of RW@@ E in the meantime on a record depth and has left its mark by eon deep traces .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel &quot; , the German energy concept may possibly have 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the federal government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy sectors recovered a little , but still lost as little as 3.2 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( eon ) . &quot;

&quot; Auto@@ values were asked : even in the traditionally shallow summer months of August , more cars were dropped than in the prior @-@ year period , as was by the branch association Ac@@ ea to start the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers of the motor@@ bikes Daim@@ ler and BMW placed about 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen power supplies increased by 1.7 percent .

the retirement Rex Rex rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Bund @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent on 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the course of the euro declined in the afternoon on the last 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
&quot; on mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had fixed the reference rate to 1.@@ 44@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 8@@ 75 ) Euro .
4 people killed after the police of rubber shooting in Nepal shooting
&quot; four men , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police of rubber came in a crowd of men that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke into the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , leading District be@@ am@@ ter said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters had gathered outside a police station , with some of you war@@ ns stones and bran@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police have used Tr@@ ac@@ eng@@ as and then shot up into the air before she returns on rubber . &quot;
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were in@@ jured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the applied gum@@ med , known by which they can kill , but which are traditionally used as a lesser deadly alternative , apparently so produced a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that were formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ ne@@ as who wanted to have an own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent struggles since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed August , the four major political parties signed an agreement which divide the country into provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been a very controversial issue . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution was launched in 2008 , but the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure acceler@@ ates the process after the devastating earthquake which had killed thousands of people in April . &quot;

the plans to spend the cottage settlement on the Little Sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented publicly plans for the project for the first time .

&quot; months was spra@@ yed behind closed doors , sh@@ ear@@ ed , deb@@ ated , and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new cottage settlement on the little sea near Em@@ den on the table are located .
&quot; Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized building of the company &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development Committee of the E@@ Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure from the project cri@@ tic and the F@@ DP group , which commen@@ ced to the investors and administration of secrecy , Ralf Fel@@ hr@@ ates from the System @-@ Building Manager at the Offen@@ sive : &quot; we have not yet to answer all questions an answer , &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and over 50 visitors . &quot;
&quot; but it is good , all rum@@ ors now can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; the project around ten to twelve million euros , has been in discussion for months now . &quot;
&quot; fierce reactions among sea @-@ owners who had come into the meeting , called the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member of the Association of Inter@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; this is huge huge , that overlooks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; moreover he feared as many other project cri@@ tic that the traffic through the intended size of the plant would increase greatly , &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus @-@ dischar@@ ges so that this will be calculated , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , exactly what happens on the well one h@@ ect@@ are of the former Gast@@ stätte , is however still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; only do we need to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf In@@ hr@@ ates . &quot;

Google starts re@@ funding donations campaign to earn 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign that is to aid the thousands of refugees trying to aid the thousands of refugees trying to over@@ roll the thousands of refugees , as they flee from war and dec@@ im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach when disclosure of donations to his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip belonged to many dark stations and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family des@@ per@@ ately seek help . &quot;
&quot; donations are given to four charitable organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global funds raised up to $ 5,@@ 5 million in spent up to $ 5,@@ 5 million in spent on 11 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis in World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria which has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

for slightly overweight di@@ abe@@ tics can be a loss of weight loss .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss of surgery live longer than those who do not @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , a expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial article on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; loss of loss of surgery or obesity , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
&quot; they reduce hunger , and limit the physical ability to absorb food . &quot;
&quot; over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were carried out by people who are disease @-@ obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , some degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can comp@@ ute your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which have been collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and Magen@@ to - with medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who subjected to this surgery , dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 till the end of the fifth year in this trial . &quot;
meanwhile the BM@@ I remained with those who did not surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
&quot; among those , subjected to a surgical procedure , it solved in 36 % the diabetes condition totally and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is completely controlled only with one percent and in part in only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the results were carried out in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general better in the &quot; &quot; surgical &quot; group &quot; , &quot; found the authors . &quot;
the researchers also over@@ saw the patient @-@ blood mirror of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c who is reflected the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined by approximately 9 percent to approximately 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you are reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - reduced not the mortality rate in five years , so the lead researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also weigh@@ ed average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ ro@@ tom@@ y group compared to the gast@@ ric tom@@ y ( 7,@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and directories of more than a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study did not show an survival part of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of serious people in Sweden that operation goes to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish trial , it was subjected to obes@@ e people who deal with obesity , around 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that has been trying to conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not show an advantage to the survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people using a BM@@ I below 35 , which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , with an increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 , each with his BM@@ I . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting too long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , they have firmly established their body with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot pick up all refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Budd@@ ist leaders demanded to end violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his last day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which focuses on ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of West European countries is admir@@ able to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama , Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions like true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented by George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and realized that the non@@ violent response of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I have expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I said to him , the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set the violence and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold rise of sampling of hand@@ ing inf@@ ants by children in past 4 years
&quot; poison@@ ing centers in the USA report an almost 400 % increase in the number of children younger than twelve years , making the strong alcoholic disinf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , passed the cases of revenues of hand@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants for children under 12 years , which report Gi@@ ft@@ control centers , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children always come more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children of disinfection are visi@@ bly drinking while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation at social media . &quot;
show videos on YouTube such as young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap adventure .
youngsters have supposedly bl@@ amed a disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a tougher drink .
younger children can be lowered by attractive dies of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ed .
&quot; there are a disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berries , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
hand@@ ing disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in small children can already run a few spra@@ ys for alcohol det@@ oxi@@ fication .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Po@@ ison Centre in the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not leave a sip of whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children and when children come about it , then it is a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which recently had four spra@@ ys from after straw@@ berry sc@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in school had taken , was brought into emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; their blood @-@ alcoholic concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is regarded as drunk at an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah slept her words and was not able to walk as she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors said they overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of deer @-@ trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had spread the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers advised to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and disinfection out of the range of the child .
about alcohol det@@ oxi@@ fication far were a few disinf@@ ect@@ ants connected with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 two women in Ontario were killed , after the swal@@ lowing of hand@@ shake @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , not de@@ kl@@ ed ingredient . &quot;
&quot; healthcare authorities think that the product meth@@ anol sof@@ tens , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ anol plants , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January the three students of the fourth grade were planned in the State New York , their &quot; common &quot; teacher by giving anti@@ bacterial products around the educational space &quot; , &quot; it announces a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand@@ s@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and trans@@ figured it out of her room .
&quot; the police concerned the promised plan as &quot; &quot; los@@ tz &quot; , &quot; and discipl@@ ined operations to the school authority . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three cars damaged
&quot; at a distr@@ ust in the cross @-@ Spanish border between the northern ring and on cattle , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old drivers has been in@@ jured during a rear @-@ end car . &quot;
&quot; a 60 @-@ year old lor@@ ry drivers drove on the cross @-@ Spanish road towards the roundabout industrial area , and participated too late that at the roundabout two pres@@ ump@@ y vehicles had stopped . &quot;
&quot; in the episode , he pr@@ un@@ ed with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ ts , and whether this vehicle has stopped at a previously Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the vehicles involved in the unknown vehicles , they were rated by about 10 000 euros , divi@@ des the police . &quot;

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays for face about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are rum@@ ors about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates were not under elevated control since they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch tool@@ guide . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football @-@ white v@@ ans - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former ranks of the mid@@ fiel@@ der and former nation@@ als of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , since there is no title @-@ rival@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; said Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights from the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the leader@@ boards are not there .
people here talk not just about the return of the leader@@ boards .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
I will let things go around , sw@@ aying d@@ eil@@ a . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian leader sw@@ or , turning things . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aberdeen , which now with five point lead to the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but D@@ eil@@ a said : &quot; &quot; Celtic had already suffered bad times , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this exactly - but we have to continue .
&quot; we really need the support from Celtic because that makes the player better . &quot;
&quot; now , together , is so important . &quot;
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully on January @-@ transfers

the ex @-@ Chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season period to integrate with what you &apos;ve seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage will be done by adding un@@ necessary players to that which you really need .

&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; there is no team , who has won all , in Po@@ or , or Li@@ gen , who did not win games of this sort . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained in the period of May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people excluding work for the United Kingdom was increased to EUR 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.@@ 9 per cent higher than over the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 per cent as the figures of the office for National Statis@@ tics ( ons ) showed .
&quot; meanwhile , employment in Scotland has fallen to 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland was shown in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; the Permanent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell , commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and unemployment .
dr@@ unken dis@@ rup@@ ting the process
&quot; because the personnel were not able to di@@ vul@@ ge the situation , the employees called the police . &quot;

why I will be a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; some later today , except for late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is put to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen I will sit in a crowd @-@ gallery in the death room in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip made by the poison@@ ed . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of His death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see directions in the US , and there are often more applications available than those places , a mak@@ er@@ un@@ ner lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites of 12 to five .
who will be selected will make it em@@ otive .
I cannot do this .
&quot; in addition to Richard glos@@ si@@ ps , I will sit , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months of the months with a telephone number and a two and a half hours . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t allow me to record a notebook and a pen in order to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
&quot; a journalist made of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you will receive access . &quot;
I describe myself with it .
&quot; she dre@@ amed that she could have formulated it better , but she still thinks that it is wrong with what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international re@@ porter is present to write .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a Report of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I will not go here again on all details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to act a benefici@@ ary .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death part .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I shall see him dying .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
other re@@ por@@ ters will give to which you can turn to this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death .
man under dam@@ p police @-@ hunt @-@ talks of the C@@ anning River to come
the C@@ anning V@@ ale pol@@ ishing was dry even when he over@@ talked the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; trying a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police , was un@@ successful , when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , and tried to return , &quot; &quot; trying to stir him gently , to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday to a domestic break @-@ off incident in pel@@ vic .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , it tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming , come and get me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic to make his own form wet , so he turned to a more depend@@ able tactics - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
champion @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers Ben Cous@@ in offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , Cous@@ in his car went into the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;
&quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired indigenous people to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cous@@ in @-@ Bi@@ athlon . &quot;
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards attempted to comp@@ ose him out and threat@@ ens to end racing sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards von Racing Victoria tried to have tried in past year a sp@@ y in his stables and thre@@ aten to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he moved to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and maintained that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai , because of an R@@ ul@@ ing treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do that which is best for racing , and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive Kob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ tasting at Li@@ dar@@ is which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had returned 18 months because of es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to see it like too high hanging grapes .
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have been looking for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything came out at once , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
you know that it is far .
&quot; sometimes you have to react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk to the office , and I want my owners think that I try my best for her . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I do not do it , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had won the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Department of Integr@@ ate was trying to sp@@ y his stable . &quot;
&quot; in the eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - I will design@@ ate , if I will be asked - and offered him a job in my stables , to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ alls , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
&quot; if that is the case , they certainly should believe in their n@@ oses , because they are trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , acting president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ ver , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should I view this to the view that it is personally ?
did the R@@ V@@ L sit down and perhaps do people outside of coaches responsible for what is going in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they must take my license and for@@ sake me , and I have no doubt that what I say , they now think about it . &quot;
but I arrived at the point where I am no matter and this makes me sad .
this really makes me very sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and they are pushing for a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the frustration level of the trainer have built himself with the long @-@ lasting Kob@@ alt examination of Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching also led to him that he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known because of its preparation of the un@@ curved master black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the cre@@ eds of treatment &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; , &quot; after a pack of mud or tone into the horse has been portra@@ yed , which ble@@ w the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has irrit@@ ated mud on the leg .
it could have been like that night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday .
it also had such a race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack at the race day . an examination of this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who put these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you went too far , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y suggests to ring ri@@ vals for ri@@ vals with ri@@ vals
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y has given criticism of the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League in the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators will have allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ fighter &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne B@@ enn@@ ett made a hardly obsc@@ ured note to the CM Team after his team won the Final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two out of Queensland is not &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; in the rank@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y defended the d@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew , and said that they were focused on their &quot; contact &quot; only on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading trainers with his team helps him confident , since it was so happy that they were concerned about the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that emerges repeatedly - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ fighter , when she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing during the whole year at our defensive system or techniques , but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es at a real focus and that &apos;s provided for us the trend . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not losing a shock , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
&quot; it is com@@ ical , as this is always up to this season . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked the &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening , and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y . &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team and I said that he will take care of a she@@ ath .
&quot; but now he has a team to play this and we see that exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball game , which you would like to play when you have this kind of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , making them as they can play . &quot;
&quot; I increased confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried , against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ am@@ y pointed out that the game is achieved Storm at R@@ oo@@ sters a higher result than the game bronze against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the bronze was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and do not make points a bit of gri@@ pping ?
for me it is the Game schedules .
&quot; when they mention it , it means that in one phase we will meet again upon it . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has free this weekend because they won the right to receive North Queensland Cow@@ boys , or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks at the next Saturday night in the Pre @-@ finals at the A@@ AMI Park . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 US deposit after drug requests
&quot; a man who potentially threat@@ ens a life @-@ long sentence due to its temp@@ tation to come into ownership of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ elled after Queensland , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 each . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police was arrested 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America over Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and launched in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his collaborators in the marina in the afternoon and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police had 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite having possibly fi@@ able punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , there would be no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been due to a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the Ju@@ dge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter F@@ agan , was worried about the danger of danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the prison , he lied to the police about his place of residence . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and daughter &apos;s father had offered a $ 200,000 dollars to achieve security together to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the plac@@ eable explanations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judges f@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from it , not to appear , warned he . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian passport , which gives the police every day and stick to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used phone from girls to attract pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le for sending pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the phone of the girl when this slept in an online measurement @-@ aging service provided by which he received a series of invol@@ un@@ tary pictures of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the Sle@@ eping Ho@@ g@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found the confusing messages and alar@@ ming immediately her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analy@@ sing then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; web research , the terms used for the search for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g maintained then to the officials that he did it , as it would be to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and he then , &quot; a polic@@ eman would be to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , it would be a addiction that he addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he gave to that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but he said , unless he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ aring a pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him pictures and asked to send more photos .
he said he did so to temp@@ t her .
&quot; he said he is sick in his head , when he drink , and said , he wants to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ m@@ bling and on the wine . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and made the def@@ endants with it .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant computer and Play@@ station used to talk to girls , who saw much younger than he . &quot;

cars from the compact class are currently in demand : approximately 28@@ ,@@ 1 per cent of new registrations were cancelled in August on this segment alone in August .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( publication from 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , between all the futur@@ istic conceptual cars and new Ober@@ kl@@ as@@ se@@ - and luxury cars are presented in this year mainly many new compact models . &quot;
&quot; one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German auto industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
&quot; thus the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra model shall not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is launching an entry under the biggest competitor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;

&quot; unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra be as fifth . &quot;
&quot; a second variant will follow in the spring of Kom@@ bi , which is also visible on the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will Astra be driven by the Astra on the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra Con@@ competitor in the race .
on the trade fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only a five @-@ fifth in a conventional and an emph@@ atic sporty GT .
&quot; in trade it comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan type will be able to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters are an@@ un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a ex @-@ prisoner of the Federal State of Pen@@ al Te@@ gel , which was housed a month in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the injury of their human dignity , prisoners have fundamentally claim financial compensation , when they were in small cells . &quot;
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
sufferers can then even hope for money if they were imprison@@ ed only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; this was an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional referendum in Karlsruhe : he was set up in a sub@@ trac@@ table Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell , with about five square meters ground floor ; the toilet was spati@@ ally un@@ divided . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who is now back in the open air after the information of his lawyer , has moved to a bigger cell . &quot;
his ministers have failed because of the un@@ worthy arrest of detention of the Land of Berlin .
&quot; however , the constitutional magi@@ cally took the judgement of the chamber Berlin on and rejected the case for renewed testing . &quot;
you see the man &apos;s death in@@ jured .
the Chamber of Jud@@ gement shall now be decided on the amount of compensation .
&quot; although for legal reasons from the question@@ able period only a few days of arrest warran@@ t was decisive for the compensation , it was granted . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; an un@@ degeneration of the legal protection of the personality would be to fear . &quot;
the Chamber of Jud@@ gement must now clarify the amount of monetary damage .
the Constitutional Court in the past have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
&quot; thus they spoke only in April to a prisoner , because he was bare in a cell . &quot;
human in@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well as the multi@@ projection of a cell without a separate toilet .
&quot; in addition , the Berlin Constitutional Court , in November 2009 , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the then Kl@@ äger was located over three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pr@@ isons had come into the head@@ lines in recent weeks as well .
&quot; prisoners are thus again included 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ vity , even to bat , it should have already occurred because of the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; after information on the gro@@ c@@ ision , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of things , 19 shall 2016 off . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to take on it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany after the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Culture in Germany , after statement by vice chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge determination : &quot; I will say again and again : we can create this and we create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives us the following overview .
&quot; according to different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) the apartments are held every year - and the next five years . &quot;
&quot; that is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot;
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living space but above all at affordable housing objects : annually 60@@ ,000 until 80@@ ,000 social housing from the rental price fall out , and around these particularly favorable apartments will also apply refugees . &quot;
&quot; Bundes@@ liga @-@ in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) intends to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing had to be taken every year , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; moreover , scientists and the Federal Minister agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
estimates of the Institute for Employment Research ( Employment Research ) is estimated that 55 percent of the population were employed in Germany over the long term .
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to assist them in their career , critic@@ ised the Claudia Walter , Project manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is crucial if they are working in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the migrants , says Migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ issu@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ aci@@ di@@ hardt , a political change has given him : from work @-@ giving for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; there used to be a working ban for asylum seekers of up to five years in November 2014 , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 as well as the residence obligation , the asylum seekers into a residential place . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the lack of qualified labour - it also prevailed in the view that refugees should be able to earn more quickly of access to the labour market . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; up to now , there is still no offer of general and @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often obtained by personal contacts .
the creation of networks is therefore according to Thr@@ issu@@ er of the Königs@@ weg path for work integration .
&quot; Berlin school administration has found that only a few mot@@ orized parents to give their children to the Kit@@ chen , estimated 10 to 15 percent , it is only once important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration . &quot;
to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita distri@@ butes the management hand in various languages .
&quot; if the need for res@@ ists must rise strongly by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of learning - by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
in the countries students will be prepared for lessons with no more lessons in welcome classes .
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , even by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; to them there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ation from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk is estimated that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; basically no federal country asylum seekers or commem@@ oration for the study - the only exception was Berlin , J@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) has given up his position now . &quot;
study @-@ sensitive refugees could be facilitated the access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or bur@@ gl@@ ers receive no performances after the asylum seekers , when they start a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter will generally receive no BA@@ Fö@@ G , because they do not fall under the circle of the bel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years , to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 , this amount was shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but also this financing gap must be closed , call St@@ eff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Under@@ secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
students should receive BA@@ Fö@@ G immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of its identity . &quot;
Islam should gradually indul@@ ge the same rights as they have built the churches and develop the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to a new state of religions .
&quot; it would also be important for the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which is professional around the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
rights are also obligations .
&quot; thus , the representative of Islam must be in clear and ready to collaborate with the state in many areas and to offer some control possibilities to him . &quot;
it also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to stra@@ ined such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bay@@ rische ischer Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he suggested that the Basic Law can be translated to Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be a topic of the whole society today . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the Maj@@ ority society will change , the reduction of discrimination and racism will be displaced . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been a anti @-@ discrimination and a general anti @-@ discrimination policy .
&quot; however , it is slowly learning how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ ship showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist image systematically ignored . &quot;
&quot; equal chances for all : what &apos; migrants &apos; organizations and stakeholders &apos; interests are long calling for international agreements like the anti @-@ racial ri@@ ots Germany , has to become a reality in the coming years , when the country will stay peaceful and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , Germany has been able to provide healthcare from medi@@ cally , says Mr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; in terms of man@@ power and capacities , we are creating this , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , that extra money must flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , calls Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , to all com@@ ers , equal to the registration health @-@ types . &quot;
power delivered services could later be settled in the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people are feeding with the limited performance catalogue using the asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors make first to create the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin Economics of The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven , migrants are worse affected by their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practice , would have to pay interpre@@ ting expenses , calls them . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be helped with more general medical practitioners in the emergency treatment . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; under refugee damage , it is about getting much more un@@ related disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partial other disease pictures , German doctors came from their education but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ asi@@ tism or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize . and what affects the nu@@ is@@ ance , be even relief in sight of the refugees . &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed education system ; several refugees are even doctors .
&quot; in order to practice , they must prove their qualification as well and may be insp@@ ected once again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany are ill from a bundle of Psych@@ otherap@@ ists ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ically sick , most suffer from a post traum@@ atic stress disorder or under depres@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; particularly viol@@ ently , refugee @-@ sk@@ in@@ der , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study published by TU München shows that each fifth Syrian refugee s@@ are traum@@ atis@@ ed in Germany .
&quot; who is that of a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress @-@ controlled disorder , suffers from among other things so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with breath @-@ not , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart of heart and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleeping - and concentrations of concentrations , strong down@@ th@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms of chron@@ ically , be an early treatment necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ic cranes received refugees from psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , psych@@ ically sick people who seek asylum seekers in the social classes make an application for psych@@ otherapy , but the process usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the welfare of the most commonly used labor@@ ers or doctors , who are not trained for the psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus att@@ ests to the traditions of Circus @-@ art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and a unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus invites you in the man@@ ege on the tiles . was@@ en to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the circ@@ us . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine living without my circ@@ us family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie , Jacob , Ti@@ bers and j@@ ectiv@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current hur@@ d@@ ment .
already for more than 33 years the circ@@ us in the hands of the family .
the gift to delight is thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important to take away people away from their everyday reality and to take them to a totally different world for two hours , empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ event . &quot;
&quot; man@@ e@@ gen@@ y with world @-@ city flair &quot; , &quot; said Director Reinhard completed his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the circ@@ us convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; at the international circ@@ us festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ low@@ n family draws the audience with wi@@ t and charm in their spell . &quot;
even the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
the heroes of the silent movies want to pick up the Cub@@ an duo .
ligh@@ tness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s her@@ b@@ ins in the storm .
apart from a large number of salmon the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus are also intrigu@@ ed with a sense of finger@@ tips and num@@ b@@ ness .
balance the wheel on a sphere .
for He Yuan no problem .
slim human beings fascin@@ ate and sc@@ aring at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of the ac@@ rob@@ atics by little else and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every sense .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ ine &apos;s mother , Brig@@ itte . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of Circus are only too often subject at different animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie they also take place : &quot; &quot; it is not good to our animals , it does not work well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ legged artists &apos; , as they are lovingly called , will be read after the possibility of every wish . &quot;
we want to cooperate with animals and have fun with them .
feel the animal not at ease and does not want to go into the ring .
the first commandment is : good for the animals to care .
&quot; especially on their zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ v@@ te , the family is very proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived together eight years in a en@@ closure and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; tells Brig@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus . &quot;
for each visitor something might be something for us .
&quot; one is certain , &quot; said Steph@@ anie , &quot; &quot; regardless of whether five or 1 200 audience , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ v@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps a false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , an el@@ dest guide , went down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread via social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also tri@@ mm@@ ed by claims of MEPs who had anonymous death threats , and they had warned them that by Mr Mu@@ gabe were connecting with Bu@@ hr@@ inv@@ oked by Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; last month , she had rested , and had ri@@ pped him during his speech to the State of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese told that seven Op@@ posi@@ tional politician SMS messages received on their phones that they warned that they warned against Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ it &apos;s Address .
&quot; the message comes from a number , which is not indicated , but it has the title &quot; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ it &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the members of the EP members that the immunity in Parliament will end , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
chief captain said that the party guided by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ v@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the danger for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up to 25,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and development efforts at the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; HP will be listed back to two listed companies later this year , and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business @-@ hardware and its service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job super@@ structure leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , who will guide the unity after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise becomes smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business &quot; , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as a stand@@ alone company we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has annual 2012 revenue of more than EUR 50 billion and will be focused on providing ever @-@ integrated , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it shares a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s of the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , to connect electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to tackle the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the most recent in this area based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide a better performance . &quot;
FC senal - captain Mich@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mate must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed on Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation is based on plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play Christmas again before Christmas . &quot;
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss the next four games for England and in view of its history is certainly still uncertain in the next summer on the European Championship .
&quot; the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate dum@@ b , and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ eas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; this type of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said L@@ ess . &quot;
it is a bone that is not good .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with its buttons or with the injury he had previously had .
&quot; this may be from purely medical point of view , but like a little also recognized , there is the related risk of further injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere from his debut six years ago .
he also played in 65 von Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league for the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture of ar@@ senal is that they have been in six of eight players since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League Club who have recorded most viol@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil @-@ circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and gain mar@@ tial control &quot; , &quot; said L@@ ess . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
ar@@ senal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night at Din@@ amo Zagreb to play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track on the coming Wednesday , and turning around is a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta arrived . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Post@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to get a little break off , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although ar@@ senal favour@@ ites are , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inser@@ tion effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign in the last season started .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening with at the Ri@@ chter@@ sk@@ ala 3.@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has drawn the teaching of the past season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco and will be driven away from the distant hope , with its management the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said L@@ ess . &quot;
it has never worked with ar@@ senal .
&quot; we were very close to this in 2006 , but on the other hand I am far enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ festival : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons to men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more du@@ bi@@ ased as ever before has been said to prove to be su@@ icide under young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ tion ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a miserable life ) in 2015 when the year of the man , with the goal of asking the culture to ask if they need it . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms show that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of con@@ val@@ escence can double . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not depres@@ sed , a circle of spiritual friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental issues . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends who can work a friendship .
&quot; in the age of social media guided communication , focusing on style about substance , in@@ medi@@ at@@ ability of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist extr@@ ins@@ ic values call ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not be bought . &quot;
the Beautiful of Friends was that this focus was put on its head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , who gli@@ stering by interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , Mom@@ bers , at the football stadium and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can refer to this , even if they often ref@@ utable , to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; how a member of the phone calls it to me : ... &quot; &quot; my in@@ audi@@ ted role for people who feel depres@@ sed and su@@ icide , has really clearly showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old phrases &quot; I come with it , has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot;
&quot; Friends is one of the shows , which comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term gla@@ zing mechanisms . &quot;
it clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so very my objective out@@ si@@ ders status over the phone can help people in moments of despair , also helping the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Paradise with the celebration of the day completely re@@ arranged scenery , why don &apos;t you then make your friends a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you just sit around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ festival
&quot; Santa Maria meets to help PS@@ G to rent , Malmö . &quot;
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malmö .
&quot; di Mary meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to Malmö . &quot;
here are the game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain presented its Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in Prince car park on Tuesday .
&quot; di Mary met less than four minutes after the start of its Champions League &apos;s debut as PS@@ G players who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions , before they finally achieved its lead , as Cav@@ ani , in the 6@@ 1. minute , a head@@ gate . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A requires a strong start to the Swedish master , since it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ V rounds , but an improvement to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a small game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ ni I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s missed odds before the gate . he was later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , with whom he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win to our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to have in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I &apos;m un@@ fortunate that we have not yet reached one or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that could hold on the weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was released in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ in@@ ean whis@@ ker has been referred to as the man who has won the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he ran in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense , before he finished on Joh@@ an Wil@@ and pass beautifully in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would win a great victory , which was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö found Celtic in a play @-@ off , to reach this level , joined with nine nation@@ alists in the field and was with a five @-@ man defense , and two deep in the middle ground up a serious opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered him little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself sometimes , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was killed in the first half of the first half and later , after Cav@@ ani had settled it after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed out much more skill , when he turned his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , whom Di Maria turned into a film shot of Wil@@ ders in the 5@@ 2nd minute at P@@ fo@@ sten ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay who scored his sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left f@@ ke of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended up all thoughts that Malmö could return in the game , and just an excellent input of po@@ stage from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement wheels E@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has detected a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer from Malmö , Age Har@@ an , gave later that PS@@ G has played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league that is not the same level . &quot;
qualifi@@ ers are not sufficient . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and Europ@@ am@@ en@@ ster X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obvious several years ago just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger , four times champion League league , two times European Champion - the title @-@ list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
in the summer she finished 35 @-@ year @-@ old after 24 years the FC Barcelona and went to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
&quot; however , in an interview with the Mar@@ ca betra@@ ying X@@ avi , now that he was already standing before the departure from Barcelona before the departure from Barcelona . &quot;
one told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me .
&quot; Madrid was at that time all , we know nothing &quot; , &quot; he tells . &quot;
and also the registered FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; it was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ my wanted to have me .
&quot; reminder : in summer 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi is not inter@@ changeable
but the change did not come about .
and the differenti@@ ating man therefore works for the German record master : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P has told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without myself .
&quot; with that , he has dealt with me . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns playing time in 2008 / 2009 would have been named with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against the entire distance on the law@@ ns , turned the Red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the top of the royal classes . &quot;

&quot; Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with abu@@ sive un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! wo@@ w . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian said . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer of Ben aff@@ ol@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly @-@ brothers to discuss about the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director , who will always treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line that is be@@ aten by her white sugar . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio , for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on tried to give that her regime &quot; &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion is broadcast we explo@@ ded the social media prior to dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on comments .
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni oppres@@ sed his fur@@ y over the clip by wrote &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on speaks about the only black person in the room , so he can tell her variety - that &apos;s SO W@@ HI@@ TE that it hurt . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned over 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on comments come at a time , at the forefront of political representation in the media at the head of the social discussion . &quot;
&quot; after the Teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement achieved Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter nationwide and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities , discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured re@@ plac@@ ements . &quot;
in February the singers Prince began playing a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums is silent , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) . &quot;
&quot; like books and black lives , albums also have their meaning . &quot;
more recently leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Ha@@ sel@@ beck whether the group should be considered as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently announced that Dam@@ on was hosted on a list of entertainment , producers and media @-@ gu@@ le , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warri@@ or &apos;s crow@@ ning First Champion
professional clim@@ bers and control options Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athl@@ ete who won the American Ninja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Great Prize of 1 million $ with home .
&quot; the competition show , which just ended their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of its obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the seasonal , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the Fin@@ als . &quot;
at the last task the climbing has belonged to a 75 foot long climbing time in 30 seconds .
&quot; it ended the task within the time that he was the first athl@@ ete , which ended the first athl@@ ete , who completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Ninja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard fight , still under shock over the profit of the Great Prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never deserved more than 10,000 $ or his life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac ! above his bunch of money . &quot;
so very suddenly . as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finals , and why B@@ ritten , although he first encountered the course not at all , not any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it will be the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much the money is a wonderful price , and life changed , he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t believe he had never swe@@ pt .
he has just been so happy to have done what he did .
masses of distinc@@ tions received he from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; she said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Isaac would have felt just as if they were dealt with the reels .
&quot; America Ninja Warri@@ or was extended for an apple rel@@ ay , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak into Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
the second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
formerly they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball than today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League of Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ ett@@ ar that play this part on Tuesday perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the tw@@ ins drop a chance to rise up within a game half of Houston Ast@@ or for the second American League of Wild card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Di@@ mus . &quot;
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon gave his early offensive support rather than Detroit offered three times in the first two sessions then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
&quot; Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) played 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ es , and made it possible for three weeks . &quot;
it was just his third @-@ winning start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pics of each game , and therefore I want to go into the game very much . &quot;
&quot; the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits at the Seattle nav@@ el on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has fine the pl@@ ywood &quot; , &quot; said Ap@@ pr@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( percussion ) , looked much better off in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
with three gro@@ oves in the back at the end of the seventh interior the tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back in the game .
center Fiel@@ d@@ By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton concluded the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right to Aaron H@@ icks in a B@@ unt , and Simon gave his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran down Wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the R@@ ookie @-@ stroke Miguel S@@ ano , of the right @-@ wing Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen , a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ Run at the second bringing Ver@@ hagen to the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play .
&quot; it was the major launch in the Major League for the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe has proposed a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth @-@ Run , the Wall created a R@@ BI Double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
however the right @-@ handed race S@@ ano on three Pit@@ ches for his fifth download .
Detroit benef@@ ited to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game from an even more movable @-@ Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three of us in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the t@@ off@@ ense list before the game had been missing for over a month due to a back of back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch for the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they got in the first the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ man , Hus@@ hes made a single at Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z in the game that &apos;s a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed its 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ es in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game , when he tried to get to the third , which the threat posed . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers placed on the second obtained a one @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Field G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
he did not go especially well but he caught the right position .
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was located in a pitch @-@ count , did not score points in the third inning , before it was replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver of A.@@ J.@@ A@@ p . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z divided due to an injury of the throw @-@ school .
he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulders of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injury list , because of a school lock@@ out , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris won from the injury list to start the tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in the exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30 &quot;
he was missing from 20 August because of a p@@ air@@ out in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the target Field at Wednesday

hundreds of refugees shall come in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people are supposed to be housed in the emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden , such as the town of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
you expect 450 to 750 successful refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ es@@ sian state capital were prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily arrive there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the last ten days alone , according to information requested by the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister of G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse . &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have been furnished in sports halls because of the large number of refugees
Isch@@ l : German military measures in Syria have an option
&quot; the Director of Munich &apos;s Security conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that different thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he threw the European states &quot; &quot; collective &quot; . &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce was gone by military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict is approaching our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said at Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on site for refugees .
Austria controls the south and eastern borders
&quot; in Germany , Austria has once again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; in Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , the Austrian Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared no one on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F . &quot;
also Germany did not return refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; the question of an agreement , after which Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , &quot; says Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , &quot; said he was already given a link between the Director General for Public Safety and representatives from Germany . &quot;
concrete numbers they did not calling and dism@@ issed on talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees from Hungary came to Austria during the last days .
your goal is usually Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ man filed an extraordinary summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach in the crisis .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new start on the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in the light of the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial effort and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; the Confederation is going to make this together with the countries , and announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of meetings with the Prime Minister of the Regi@@ st@@ erium in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel underlined , for those people , who brow@@ ses their protection against it . &quot;
&quot; but , who does not have a job perspective , could not remain in Germany . &quot;
this view was dra@@ gged into account in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a &quot; huge force of force . &quot;
thousands of dist@@ res@@ sing refugees now move on the Balkan route .
Hungary had concluded its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on the night to Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary would like to prevent the tu@@ gs off @-@ pl@@ ated pl@@ ated over Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first arrest of people that had under@@ cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , there were thousands of more migrants on their way to the Greek border . &quot;

&quot; but he wants to pay attention to his slender line , that is often rather de@@ pl@@ eted by them . &quot;
for man@@ goes also contain relatively much sugar - above all Sac@@ char@@ ose .
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits yet : they are stuck in them B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. Be@@ all contain man@@ goes but much vitamin A and its advanced level beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;

when buying Man@@ gos are not too soft or too solid and pleasant smells .
the form@@ ulating colour alone says nothing about how ri@@ pe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes really delicious .
they should store at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet food .

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther position
nearly 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther place in Rome .
&quot; in the presence of the Federal President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a Nami@@ bian square was baptised in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on Wednesday , in the name of the German Re@@ fl@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; , &quot; he will now be honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of Rome right next to the Colos@@ seum .
the naming was requested by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded the protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority often only in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; with the place , in symbolic way , the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome will be welcomed . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the annual turn 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he received the city then as a bul@@ ding sin .
his negative impressions are likely to be encouraged by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Lu@@ ther had then initiated with his th@@ eses against the las@@ th@@ on trading the spl@@ itting of the gen@@ dic church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold pl@@ ated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has updated the introduction and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible which is now published with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt who formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motives .
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equal with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : the respective topics adapted , that can quite be quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked in his bi@@ ble project for which he made a subjective artistic choice from the many topics of &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; stages are cycles that devote themselves to topics like crosses , pl@@ ag@@ ues , bi@@ ds or father@@ land . &quot;
with this he spontane@@ ously fascinated a number of partners : this is true for the Lu@@ ther Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his emphasis on artwork @-@ books .
and since mainly the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has been on the basis of painting with the particular Bible sites .
&quot; he has interpreted the &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Old Bible Bible and thus &quot; &quot; into current relations &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of al@@ ts painting .
nestled among the original Bible verses of Martin Lu@@ ther and each one of the artist you are formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry @-@ band has golden letters .
&quot; thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately at all tri@@ ggers for the Bible @-@ Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant rulers . &quot;
&quot; then the education happened to pass by the cane , &quot; &quot; recalls &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work that , in order to perhaps for@@ ge myself with the Lord Father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to put art in fast @-@ lasting time again and again : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is now marked by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is then displaced .
artists have a different desire and bliss to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer come into the pictures , &quot; see them and feel what strength they have : &quot; the image looks for his return . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post was born on Tuesday in the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; ever &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts arts : &quot; I like how he understands his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I have not noted the Bible completely to comprehend the Bible , but that is for him important , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explained merely . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from the Lu@@ ther Verlag , this work is an invitation to bro@@ aden his life and to find freedom . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for master@@ y , both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility . &quot;
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas Prin@@ ts - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15th in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction starts for BM@@ X train
&quot; plans have made place to place the company commissioned to model the ground level for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished , but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finished again . &quot;
&quot; failure in politics and administration were absor@@ bing , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the train . &quot;
&quot; so hills de@@ ported , new place were sought - now with the planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will go into October , I was able to announce the First Community Delegation to Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the kinder@@ garten and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year happened again , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it sol@@ ves then without &quot; &quot; additional mem@@ o@@ pause &quot; &quot; started with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga continues to be a clear sign on weekends . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the football has responded to the ti@@ ck@@ ling situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its policy to help tackle the challenges that lie ahead . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this being the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; and in principle no one can say , that doesn &apos;t address me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting for every single person to get a handle on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
he wanted to discuss the refugee situation in Germany at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the German Chancellor , and get there the Minister of State , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ mat@@ u@@ z , and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; since the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
but the crucial turn@@ outs must face politics .
the German Football Association therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach is at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;

report : SAP pres@@ de@@ ity loses an eye on accident
&quot; the Chief of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill M@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has made a left eye on several reports by falling in the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident at the stair@@ way in the House of his brother in the US , he had fallen into a water glass after midnight , which he has carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost hem@@ med , was impot@@ ent , and then went out to the street - this he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; Where &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder H@@ asso plat@@ former . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; beginning October we meet in front of the meeting meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said flat . &quot;
the 54 yrs of age should be at the meeting and &quot; Ful@@ ly capable . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday night tour ) in October he will come back to Germany and continue to conduct the software group .
&quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I stood all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his chairman H@@ asso Platform , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t &apos;s &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP @-@ headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important for him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen so . &quot;
&quot; important is to be up , if you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare parts pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except the skir@@ m@@ ish ...

football : BV@@ B without re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar - Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes come to a com@@ eback from Marco Sig@@ us in the first group game of the European league . &quot;
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7@@ pm / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely upon him unfortunately , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ ic against Lever@@ k@@ usen will be back again , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will change his pedi@@ gre@@ f not only on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a shift to the ke@@ eper position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place by Chief ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the soccer teacher the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; whether past@@ ur@@ f@@ eller in future is used in all Europe League games , but Tu@@ ch@@ el left openly . &quot;
with high probability he will also ride the second game .
&quot; the for@@ ged statement by Mit@@ ra Re@@ us that the final step for BV@@ B in the Europe League has to be the target , holds middle @-@ field Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; &quot; that is Marco not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
robot cars : government wants to become a leader for Germany
&quot; in Germany , the federal government shall be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner on the will of the German government on the change of the car technology . &quot;
&quot; the federal interior decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the IA@@ A of a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
automated driving and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less st@@ alls : do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
&quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which coinci@@ des with representatives of the industry in the IA@@ A . &quot;
the Concept Network of the Ministry of Transport stressed on the things the importance of the mobile broad@@ band output and an excellent piece of digital radio .
a test of new technology is currently being produced on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; to ensure that the driver &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the German government wants to review the legal framework , and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus , Germany is about to use internationally for the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars of 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government is in addition to appoint a change to the Vienna Convention , which so far sees only the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automatic driving takes over the car the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , it will be highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ fted vehicles on public roads are only to be expected after 2020 . &quot;
value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location Germany value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ CH@@ P can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ traffic @-@ soci@@ o@@ ist S@@ é@@ Bart@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in cases of accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clearly stated . &quot;
even the German sel@@ fish cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a survey carried out on the AA pres@@ by@@ en of the For@@ sa institute on behalf of the audi@@ t@@ orium DE@@ K@@ RA will believe that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will compete in the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all , 31 percent do not believe in it . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed rose up to 20@@ 25 by autonomous cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ drive vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the Bit@@ kom port , only seven percent would agree to take control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , the in flowing traffic could be at least 15 per cent , in the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
well every fourth would have left the car control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at table tennis bat @-@ EM
Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wishes to present only one single on October 25th to October 4 .
the final decision should be submitted no later than 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title &quot; , &quot; said director Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ Chair in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing calendar in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are now no longer so a clear favorite , &quot; said single Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the subsi@@ dis@@ list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also reminded of the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo was also missing and we become a European trend . &quot;
&quot; because we should ori@@ ent ourselves &quot; , &quot; the World @-@ tran@@ g@@ lists @-@ fifth . &quot;
the English football national player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has decided to have a heavy injury on the right leg .
&quot; at the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the def@@ ender was met at a Tac@@ kl@@ ing von H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno and after a long treatment . &quot;
the first diagnosis pointed out at the 20 year old fellow @-@ players of Bas@@ tian S@@ clim@@ bers .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an end .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) has presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich ( 63 ) on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which can be scary thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who became among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits for the big star of fashion scene - and with it that he put men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; I cannot say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I got white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a luck that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ pfer has changed its beginning on a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he had been against it , for me for me an exhibition a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
when you die you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already been made in Canada in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ its . &quot;
&quot; it is a matter of tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man , the fashion story , without ever having completed a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured but it is an excellent choreo@@ graph@@ ed overall plastic work , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ ori@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was used . &quot;
14 tons of material have twi@@ sted the makers according to indications of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October legend was a special treat : a le@@ der@@ less out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are more loud as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ite mo@@ dic wal@@ ker of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a d@@ oll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he then later released himself off from fashion .
&quot; he himself lod@@ g@@ ings and looked up the dra@@ fts of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
but I bought it a bit later .
for his first own fashion show he won &apos;t pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , they were allowed to maintain the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
earlier it went on the long wr@@ apper in and around pl@@ ush it to make meters .
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and peaks developed in large quantity for customers , such as ceilings and she@@ ers elabor@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ bili@@ y Pl@@ ust . &quot;
instead the fashion is important again .
&quot; in the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze played a major role , then it has been pushing through the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , accessories such as hand@@ bags and in regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which was borrowed from past styl@@ istic eras , an increasing customer potential . &quot;
who has no niche service in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
we have already made them half of all orders .
&quot; mo@@ on@@ itze Pl@@ aces , together with nine further companies , is a member of the industry association of Pl@@ au@@ ener top and embro@@ ider@@ ies . &quot;
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; in the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been eliminated . &quot;
private specialty shops and in the wholesale trade there are almost no longer .
our products reach the customer in this way hardly yet .
&quot; today , the mass commodity is produced much cheaper in Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; also , the export , current to Russia and the U.S. &quot;
enough reasons for new ways
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score points with environmental awareness , just as Cord@@ ula Bauer has been explained by the nit@@ penet@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we perform a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially tolerated . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this also applies to the used materials . &quot;
diploma teacher U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Snow@@ eber@@ ger exterior of the West@@ Sax@@ on Academy Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to counter@@ pose a competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
that takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies who have to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often only varies slightly to hold a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historical snow@@ y tip .
the machine cuts small areas in some places .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold min@@ de@@ mic in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ lt was inspired , &quot; &quot; previously I could not start anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ y tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process they shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ ust and surroundings , and who would like to have a souvenir . &quot;
this way I view my jewellery as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &apos; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &apos; Film
legends should not stir up but Disney is still looking for a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; &quot; it is not about a novel@@ ty but rather a sort of continuation that plays 20 years after the first movie with the magic n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family Banks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who P@@ opp@@ ins plays more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director stands already : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI pus@@ hes the economy to be wider for the world
&quot; the economy has to open themselves wider , in order to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping , on Tuesday of a group , which was commissioned with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should stand up to attract foreign investments and expertise and improve the strategies for business @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the central leadership group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and reforms in advance , will introduce new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group approved a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market , relaxing to the border controls policy , the promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the local tax system . &quot;
&quot; statement will be issued on a negative list , the sectors and companies identified for investments do not come into question . &quot;
the system is tested gradually improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it points to the market a major role in the allocation of resources , a law @-@ state environment and made the market open , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the company , and ensure that companies decide how they can conduct their business . &quot;
&quot; the statement also said that China should allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; open sectors within the framework of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors will open further areas for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments , and will provide the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is made easier for foreigners to request permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to ensure their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
at the meeting we took a Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important guide like Li@@ u Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli which was reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ bor@@ der@@ es in pre@@ dat@@ el@@ fish
the European Commission wants to double the limiting values for mer@@ cury in big pre@@ dat@@ el@@ fish and allow the consumers a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
&quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is an appropriate workplace of the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are appropriately calibr@@ ated with us@@ ury in pregnant and inf@@ ants &quot; , &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt in F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt should , according to the limit values of the nervous system , for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or shr@@ inking from &quot; economic reasons &quot; of one to two milli@@ gram , one per kilo@@ gram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , big pre@@ dat@@ ors are still so strongly influenced with mer@@ cury that may not be sold on the basis of the still valid bor@@ der@@ ings about 50 percent of the fur . &quot;
&quot; according to dou@@ bling of the limits , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ ven@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in return for this locom@@ otive , the EU wants to shar@@ pen the limit values for other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ grams per kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch saw this but as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fish , as approximately car@@ p usually are charged so low , that they can already keep the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ duction at Kl@@ imagin@@ ative is therefore &quot; a pearl of de@@ fl@@ ection @-@ maneu@@ ver , which alone helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt &quot;
Mer@@ cury is one for the man highly toxic heavy metals that sharp@@ ens themselves about the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ or fishing .
&quot; the German government is warning for the fact that &quot; &quot; small volumes especially cause &quot; &quot; inf@@ ants of the nervous system &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry is explained on his website with regard to the current high@@ s , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
Mer@@ cury is mainly caused by the cohesion of the environment .
&quot; according to a written statement by the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( Mad@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bu@@ ck more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year ) , two thirds of the total quantity of Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as the Elbe , the Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had been cited in March from the paper . &quot;
last year across Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings from mer@@ cury in fish has already made some of the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
