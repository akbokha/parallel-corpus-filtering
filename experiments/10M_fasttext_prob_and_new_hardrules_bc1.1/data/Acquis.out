if a cage is used by the manufacturer recommended way , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not occur : a ) ins@@ ulated properties ;
the tit@@ er is measured by a further dil@@ ution of the examined Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es on the double in a suitable medium .
the tit@@ er is the real value of the number of the strongest serum , in which a reaction occurs ; the dil@@ ution is charged only by volume of blood cells in the total volume .
anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents that are used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating on a commercial carrier .
the world health organization has defined for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for the third group@@ ing of the international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other speci@@ fic@@ ity is worked at present standards .
according to the definition , a International standard plot contains a specific number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the tit@@ ers that are observed in individual preparations ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the reag@@ ents for the blood @-@ group determination of most speci@@ alities will be expressed as a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is being observed in a series of dil@@ ution when developing er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes .
the tit@@ er gives the th@@ inner of the Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es in the final mix within a series , where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ eal occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents to the blood @-@ group@@ ing measurement , for the International standard pre@@ par@@ ate are present ( at present anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed as the basis of the international standard @-@ par@@ ity or state of state @-@ par@@ ity at international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .

some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells formed in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group are possibly to change if the International standard is available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from blood of one or several people who are immun@@ ised by the tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that does not contain the tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ratio of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the back dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard pre@@ par@@ at of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Ser@@ um or a comparable comparison comparison with C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells to filtration .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells , which contain the tigen D , the serum is intended to respond to blood cells that do not react .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , who are intended to be used for use of slides according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , after they are mixed on a commercial carrier with a same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent im@@ bur@@ sting of C@@ c@@ De@@ e @-@ blood cells , within 30 seconds of a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from blood of one or more persons who are immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding human red blood cells that contain the tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C tigen .
therefore , these Ser@@ a are only specific to the C an@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells arise in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e @-@ blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , who are intended for use on object carriers in accordance with the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must be mixed at about 40 Â° C , within 30 seconds a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from blood of one or more persons who are immune to the tigen e of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E ser@@ a ( a complete &quot; or &quot; content &quot; ) should have a minimum number of 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e @-@ blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers in accordance with the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have , if they are mixed on a commercial carrier with a same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent im@@ bur@@ sting of C@@ c@@ dd@@ don@@ or blood cells , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera the speci@@ fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ c and the speci@@ fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ e can be extracted directly from the blood of immune persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time as defined by the manufacturer .
if a serum is intended for use on object carriers in accordance with the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time of all kinds of red blood cells that indicate a reaction , not less than in the ant@@ eil@@ igen antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be controlled by blood cells or specific substances of the group A immune .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , the A @-@ tigen , that says the ones of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; there is no human red blood cells that does not contain A @-@ tigen , that does not mean the ones of blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is , parallel to the recovered , but un@@ diluted International standard pre@@ par@@ at of the anti @-@ A blood group experience or a corresponding compar@@ ision , separately with floo@@ ding of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B @-@ red blood cells ( 1 ) .
anti @-@ A Serum can be mixed on a single slide with a same amount of 5 to 10 percent effects from A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard pre@@ par@@ at of the anti @-@ A blood group experience or a standard pre@@ par@@ at equal to equal Avi@@ o .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be caused by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B immun@@ ised .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , the B @-@ tigen contained , that says the ones of blood groups B and AB ; there is no human red blood cells that does not contain B @-@ tigen , which does not mean the ones of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the re@@ sol@@ uble , but un@@ diluted International standard pre@@ par@@ ity of the anti @-@ B blood group results or a comparable compar@@ ision , with an over@@ flow of blood cells of the group B . ( 1 ) .
anti @-@ B Serum is mixed on a single object gir@@ ders with a same amount of 5 to 10 percent effects of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination within double time will occur if the same attempt on the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ene or with a standard pre@@ par@@ at equal to equal Avi@@ o .
anti @-@ human @-@ Glob@@ ulin levels used to use in the blood group of ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against supplem@@ entation factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals that are ass@@ orted by the injection of human consumption prot@@ ector .
