this document is a summary of the public service survey report ( EP@@ AR ) in which describes how the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) presented the study carried out in order to reach recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
if you require further information about your disease or their treatment , please read the package content ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ies .
for further information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , less than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in mouth ) as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. verteb@@ res and speaking , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things which are not present ) , mis@@ ery and mad@@ ness ; • bi@@ polar disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients suffer from normal episodes of normal conditions .
A@@ bil@@ i is used for the treatment of moderate to severe severe episodes and preventive episodes on patients who have been addressed to the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used for rapid control of distur@@ ban@@ ces or behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can accept or use the melting tray for patients who prepar@@ es the swal@@ lowing of tablets .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time , the dose of aging should be adapted to the same time .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; that are chemical substances which enable communication of the nerve cells to another .
Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us probably acts as &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( also called Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ises such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a lower degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works in order to activate the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder plays a role which helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which prevents psych@@ otic or lack of symptoms and its recovery is prevented .
the effectiveness of ag@@ ger@@ t , the recovery of symptoms , was examined in three trials over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar ill@@ nesses caused by an un@@ distur@@ ban@@ ished in@@ tox@@ icity , compared to placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , A@@ bil@@ ling was conducted over twelve weeks in 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ ia and placebo which have been performing recur@@ ring , in 160 patients , where the lack of symptoms have already been stabil@@ ized .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ ion injection solution was reported in a study of 301 patient with bi@@ polar disorder , who had suffered in distur@@ b@@ ance suffering from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours compared to placebo .
in all studies the change of symptoms were investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment .
in addition , the company also led studies to examine how the body is taking the melting tray and solution for in@@ gest@@ ion ( up ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients showed an increase in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly more power reduction in symptoms than the patients receiving a placebo .
in the application of the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bil@@ ion decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies defic@@ ien@@ cies as placebo .
A@@ bil@@ ion prevented the more effective than placebo for up to 74 weeks in the previously treated patients and when in addition to an existing treatment was given .
A@@ bil@@ t injection inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses has also decreased more effective than placebo and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of A@@ bil@@ let ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ id@@ ated disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , physical strength , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , ti@@ red@@ ness , nau@@ sea level ( increased s@@ ali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rowing damage , In@@ som@@ nie ( sleep disorders ) and anxi@@ ety .
the closure of the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of ag@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and from moderate to severe mechan@@ ics in patients with bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ian episode in patients who had predominantly maneu@@ ver@@ ing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us , compared to the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of inj@@ ected un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles in patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or patients with defic@@ ien@@ ce@@ periods of bi@@ polar @-@ I failure , if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. issued an authorization for the market traffic in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is for the treatment of equal to severe episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and prevention of a new man@@ ian episode in patients who had predominantly lack of episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
a increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction is taken from the combination therapy , the arith@@ met@@ ic dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to mental illness and aff@@ ection disorders and was reported in some cases after onset of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of ep@@ idemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder we showed no higher su@@ icides risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us should be used with caution in patients with familiar kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ine diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ectious diseases ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases ( de@@ hydr@@ ation de@@ hydr@@ ation , Hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which one year or less continued , there were occas@@ ional items about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole .
if with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients receiving signs and symptoms of Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be drawn into consideration , the dose should reduce or remove the treatment .
if a patient is based on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , have to be placed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied in patients with cr@@ amp@@ or@@ ations in the inc@@ am@@ n@@ ation or in stat@@ ors that are applied with caution .
56 - 99 years old , with Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ rels in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us , an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study involving a fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ wanted cer@@ eal events in treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ens@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ am or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drug patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of gl@@ ucose levels .
a weight gain of weight is generally observed in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ oeu@@ vre , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , which is known as an additional effect on which weight gain as an additional effect and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us on the central nerv@@ ous system is caution , if Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us is in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alized drugs with over@@ laid side effects such as Se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us up 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective in@@ hibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ in and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar doses .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the joint application with high @-@ effective in@@ hibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us results in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits that weigh potential risks for the patients .
other highly efficient inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar doses .
according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ age at the beginning of the companion .
in conjunction with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y the di@@ lem@@ an or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be used together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , an increase in arith@@ pi@@ ous concentrations .
in clinical studies showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us per day no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ ph ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
people should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole .
due to the in@@ adequate data base on humans and due to the concerns in the re@@ productive studies in the animal , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits clearly just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for the mo@@ cker .
however , in other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ises had no negative influence on it .
the following adverse events were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side @-@ side effects listed below are defined in the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks came in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ ism , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ered , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ke treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study for over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ens@@ z@@ ole and 15,@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes on bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Sem@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks with a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ y@@ mptom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side @-@ side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic syndrome , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ esis , and increased mortality in elderly de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since its market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ately acute over@@ dos@@ si@@ sts with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg .
there are no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in treatment of an over@@ dos@@ ation with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is un@@ likely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits , da Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma cutting .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder in combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect is convey@@ ed on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us presented a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , for alpha @-@ 1 ad@@ hr@@ ine and for hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ receptor .
at the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ sier dependent the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ cus and at the putting time .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in one semi @-@ controlled study in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ sive patients treated to study medication , in both groups like similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ anos 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values of measuring trans@@ formers defined as secondary study variables , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks in stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ ke group and at 57 % in placebo .
in an oo@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5 % .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ies with a flexible dose of more than 3 weeks with a defic@@ ien@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ ole showed a placebo over against placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ist study about 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a defic@@ ien@@ y or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ rels showed no superior efficacy .
in two plac@@ eb@@ o- and active mono @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ies in patients with a defic@@ ien@@ y or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ rels showed an extra @-@ lasting effectiveness in week 3 and a sample effect which was comparable to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic remission of Man@@ ie on like lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which were partially reflected on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy , resulted in an over@@ laid efficacy in cogn@@ itive symptoms compared to mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time extension period over 74 weeks in a stabil@@ isation period before Rand@@ om@@ isation reached a remission in response to placebo over placebo was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , especially in the prevention of a reverse case in the Man@@ ie .
based on in vitro studies , the enzyme CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ isation of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ cy@@ tic is catal@@ y@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 catal@@ y@@ zed .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is about 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us with extensive met@@ abolic types over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and about 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic examination of patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics there was no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ n@@ ology or the effect of pir@@ ates on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us were similar in patients with severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study involving volunteers with different grave liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us and the de@@ hydr@@ ation of liver function , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to pull shots on their met@@ abolic capacities .
based on conventional studies on safety technology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the channel potential , the pre@@ clinical data failed to recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only at doses or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so that they only have limited or no significance for clinical application .
the effects of the dos@@ sier of a dos@@ sier in rats according to 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times of the mean Ste@@ ady State exposure ) and a combined side @-@ to @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( average 10@@ times of middle ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose when people ) .
Moreover , a cholesterol was determined as a result of the breakdown of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of the Hydro@@ xy@@ - Met@@ abol@@ ite concentration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans than the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose of humans rated at mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , the concentration of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ jug@@ ate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole was no more than 6 % of the concentrations that were detected in the study about 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ u@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which one year or less continued , there were occas@@ ional items about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ am or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drug patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
in conjunction with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y the di@@ lem@@ an or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be used together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , an increase in arith@@ pi@@ ous concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes on bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder in combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect is convey@@ ed on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an oo@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5 % .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ies with a fixed dose of patients with a defic@@ ien@@ y or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ rels showed no superior efficacy .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ rels was compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ rels in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max is the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ thermore , a cholesterol was determined as a result of the breakdown of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of the Hydro@@ xy@@ - Met@@ abol@@ ite concentration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( i.e. 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose of people based on humans rated at mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied to fast control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles in patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or patients with defic@@ ien@@ periods of bi@@ polar @-@ I error when oral therapy is not attached .
once it is clin@@ ically mounted , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us inj@@ tion@@ solution should be completed and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us .
to minim@@ ize the absorption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability to minim@@ ize a injection in M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle ( recommended by adi@@ p@@ ous regions ) .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can depend on individual clinical status , taking into account of the drug or acute or acute drug therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the characteristics of the product by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution .
there are no investigations to the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles that caused differently than by sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and defic@@ ien@@ cies of bi@@ polar @-@ I error .
in addition , if a par@@ ent@@ eral therapy with Ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ inen is considered necessary to be necessary , the patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
research and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al injection solution are not intended for patients with alcohol or medication po@@ is@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us should be used with caution in patients with familiar kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ine diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ectious diseases ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases ( de@@ hydr@@ ation de@@ hydr@@ ation , Hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which one year or less continued , there were occas@@ ional items about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ es , swe@@ ating and di@@ arr@@ hyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of gl@@ ucose levels .
a weight gain of weight is generally observed in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ oeu@@ vre , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , which is known as an additional effect on which weight gain as an additional effect is observed and could lead to severe complications .
nevertheless the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us , in a study where the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pet@@ us ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ off in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly called Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ at ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ ber@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the common use of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors can result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole .
other highly efficient inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar doses .
according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ age at the beginning of the companion .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg of dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received was the intensity of the Sed@@ ation larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles was associated with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ ability associated with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles , the arith@@ met@@ ic inj@@ ections was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms and behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ ic D@@ reference arm .
the observed mean follow @-@ up of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ itement Compon@@ ent points with the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar effectiveness in relation to the overall population was observed , but a statistical significance was determined because of a reduced patient @-@ number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant stronger improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .

current values of measuring trans@@ formers defined as secondary study variables , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks in stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed significantly higher reduction of the return rate , which was found at 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % in placebo .
in a O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5 % .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as a Mon@@ otherapy ) contained the medicine using a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ans treated patients on treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
considering the patients who have been treated for the first time for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between pharmac@@ euticals such as time and deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast to patients who had previously treated other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medic@@ inal products .
it must also not be used in patients who have reduced low neut@@ rop@@ es in the blood before the beginning of the treatment .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) pointed out that Abra@@ x@@ ane contained in patients where the first treatment is not more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines containing other medicines to reduce side effects compared to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Marketing &amp; Bi@@ os@@ c@@ ience Limited approval for the market placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( neut@@ rop@@ hel@@ per number &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in case of sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y degrees 3 the treatment is under@@ going to break down to degrees 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to even impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function were performed and there are currently no suff@@ iciently technical data to the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ defin@@ ite and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ arti@@ kel@@ formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have much other phar@@ mac@@ ological characteristics as other formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sy@@ mptom@@ atic treatment is treated , and the patient must not be treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in the patients don &apos;t need to be re @-@ guided tour cycles until the neut@@ rop@@ ira rate has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a unique Car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity detected in connection , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents were un@@ usually unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardi@@ ac disease treatment or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ emet@@ ics and constant means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant or women in the bound age which are no effective conception , to be applied , except for the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in@@ tri@@ cky .
women in the low @-@ age age should apply a reliable application method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is enriched , while and up to six months after treatment no child to bear .
male patients should be advised before treatment of a sperm account , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane consists of the possibility of ir@@ reversible effects .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause adverse events such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can effect on the traffic noise and the ability to serve machines .
following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects , which were observed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were recorded once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most remarkable significant hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ si@@ bly ; Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli active ingredient that stim@@ ulates the fusion of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ ae and stabil@@ izes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules through the inhibit@@ or of its de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ ization leads to a shirt of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for vit@@ ale inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ated the trans@@ cy@@ c@@ osis of plasma components in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the scope of in @-@ vitro studies proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el supports the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .

the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two un@@ riv@@ alled studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 has been used as infusion with metastatic breast cancer over 30 minutes .
this mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mono@@ therap@@ ist with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour infusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute infusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
during the inclusion in the study 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ eries .
only 14 % of the patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results of the general response and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who are &gt; first @-@ line therapy are explained below .
ne@@ ural tox@@ icity compared to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y grade 3 .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y to bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of the aggregate P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usi@@ ons of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the impact exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml in analog@@ y to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ cent@@ ation took over multi @-@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide range of ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ular distribution and / or Wei@@ ghts of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced sound tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 minutes after intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent free P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el compar@@ atively .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ gift ( 43 % ) and after a solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was considerably higher ( 53 % ) .
published in the literature about in vitro studies of the human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ el and a two smaller met@@ abolic ( 3 &quot; p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary tract was 4 % of the total dose of less than 1 % of the Met@@ abol@@ ite 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ el , which indicates a far non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ aring .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ dan is similar to an organic medicine which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and the same substance ( also called &quot; reference age &quot; ) .
patients with normal blood circulation values might occur in patients with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood loss is not possible , if a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml may be expected .
treatment with se@@ d@@ amed must be managed under the supervision of a physician who owns experience in the treatment of patients with ill@@ nesses , for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood pressure , Ab@@ se@@ d@@ amed is inj@@ ected in a v@@ ein .
injection may also be carried out by the patient or his coun@@ sel@@ ections , if they have received an appropriate guide .
patients with chronic ren@@ al failure or patients receiving chemotherapy should always be observed in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ iter with adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are used before treatment to ensure that no iron gel consists of iron and iron should be administered during the whole treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia is caused by a Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ ine defect or that the body does not suff@@ ice to affect the body &apos;s own Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in is also applied prior to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that has been incorporated into a gene ( DNA ) that it is capable of formation of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ dan was compared with the injection into a v@@ ein in the framework of a main study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems associated with reference problems .
all participating patients were enrolled at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in eight weeks before they were either converted to se@@ ver or continue to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ism between the beginning of the trial and the trial period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study where the effects of under the skin spec@@ kled se@@ ver was examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study , patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ary values were observed in the same size as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most frequent tri@@ bution of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of a bovine spongiform encephalopath@@ y ( brain problems ) as sudden , dro@@ pping mig@@ rate head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ dan must not be used in patients who may possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other components .
se@@ d@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems because additional studies are necessary to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered by no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the medicine has been carried out according to the regulations of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which se@@ d@@ amed , will provide information on medical staff in all Member States , including information on safety of the medicine .

a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s increase by more than 2 g / d@@ g ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ism can occasionally be observed on or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability should be tempted by a corresponding dose management , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is applied to the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease which makes it frag@@ ile ) both for women after the exchange years and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high level of fra@@ y risk ( bone breaks ) , including patients who have suffered a lower trau@@ matic beware of infection ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease which changed the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should receive at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) , or by injection into one muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pp@@ e@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the mor@@ ay P@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ et@@ a , a part of the data material used for Z@@ et@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis was involved , and it was examined the number of ed@@ itary and hi@@ ps over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis more than 50 years ago , the number of fra@@ c@@ tures had been studied over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies of 357 patients and compared to Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at ) for six months .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the level of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme , bone sub@@ stan@@ z ) can be adjusted in the blood again or by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of cycl@@ amen in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( excluding any other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ edi@@ os@@ edi@@ c ) over a period of three years reduced by 70 % compared to placebo .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ edi@@ os@@ edi@@ os@@ edi@@ fication ) the risk of hat@@ ching fra@@ c@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving males and women with hat@@ s , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the infusion , and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usi@@ ons .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the infusion station and oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a introduces re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors that contains A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to the treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine is explained and indicated on how they should consult the doctor .

to treat post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis and oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ ch , the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a will be recommended for two or more weeks after feeding the boun@@ ti@@ fication ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the mor@@ ay P@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the mor@@ ay Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was observed a long remission period in patients who have been addressed to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ mat@@ ory fra@@ cture is recommended to take an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D prior to the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ In@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a according to A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney disease ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A c@@ rate adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients are similar to younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data are missing and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as well as for this patient &apos;s population only limited clinical experiences .
a pre@@ existing hypo@@ cal@@ an@@ emia is achieved prior to the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to rapid inclusion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure a temporary , with sy@@ mptom@@ atic hypo@@ cal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
additionally , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cork ( bad oral hygiene ) should be used before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates in front of an application of pre@@ ven@@ ous dental treatment .
for patients who need dental treatment , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduced the risk for oste@@ och@@ on@@ ov@@ sen in the p@@ ines .
the clinical evaluation by the treatment doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of a patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a according to A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported cases of pre @-@ hop@@ fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 852 ) .
in oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ ity Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was comparable to total hardness of pre @-@ hop@@ ed numbers between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occas@@ ional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) of un@@ wanted pharmac@@ euticals are listed in table 1 .
kidney distur@@ bing of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , that is expressed as a decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ ine ) and rare cases of acute kidney failure .
the change of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( annually before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable to oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the lab findings , the temporary calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , with 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the mor@@ se @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies treated patients .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a boun@@ ti@@ fication and in the mor@@ se @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fragments after a recent th@@ igh , vitamin D was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions at the infusion station , such as the treatment , sw@@ elling , and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the field of business , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the field ) reported using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had a mark for local infections including oste@@ o@@ bes@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after dental contra@@ ctions or other dental posters .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients suffering from oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose in the field of pine with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and a placebo treated with placebo .
in the case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ cal@@ emia , an equilibrium between calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous infusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at can be achieved .
clinical efficacy in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ than ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or a medium @-@ sized flu@@ idi@@ fier with or without signs of an existing sp@@ aci@@ fier .
effects of morph@@ omet@@ rics al@@ ec@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a fell significantly over a period of three years as well as already after a year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ ra@@ c@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had reduced by 60 % reduced risk for cycl@@ ed fra@@ c@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hi@@ ft fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a pointed out a constant effect on three years , which resulted in an increase of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of boun@@ cer fra@@ c@@ tures .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the l@@ um@@ bar ic acid , hi@@ ps and on dist@@ al radius compared to placebo @-@ treatment significantly ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Increase of the bone density of the l@@ um@@ bar sp@@ ine by 6.7 % , the total hip around 6.0 % , the shaft is more than 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ ic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken according to the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vic mud .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients in comparison to placebo an increase of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone related phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d type ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum have been determined in sub @-@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before infusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment with the BM@@ D in total hardness and pain @-@ h@@ als at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment carried out more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total hardness and 4.3 % at Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als .
clinical efficacy of men in the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study were random@@ ized 508 men , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to increase the reduction of clinical trials in men ; the frequency of clinical trials was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study in males ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was involved in comparison with the percentage change of the l@@ um@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment in mor@@ ay A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ological deteri@@ oration of the bone ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase , according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.@@ 0@@ fold of age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg fra@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparison studies .
after 6 months , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain @-@ pain was observed compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified at the end of the six @-@ month main study were classified as Respon@@ sibility ( on the therapy ) , could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study was 141 of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 71 % of treated patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who are treated with a mean follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
unique and multi@@ ples 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usi@@ ons of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics data that had become abnormal .
thereafter the plasma levels rapidly decreased rapidly at &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
R@@ asch@@ es bi@@ phas@@ ic dis@@ appearance of the large circulation with half @-@ value t ½ α = 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a terminal elim@@ ination of a ½ g of 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the de@@ position about the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in ur@@ ine , while the rest is bound mainly to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentrations by 30 % at the end of the infusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced cle@@ ance of caused by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzy@@ mes is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , met@@ abolic dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) cor@@ related Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with Kre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
it follows that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al disorder up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Event report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the study evaluated the Study for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) to access the recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is applied to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) patients ( especially overweight patients ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) . • It can be applied together with other diabet@@ ics . • It can be applied together with another diabet@@ ic medicine .
additionally , it can be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that can not be adjusted using met@@ form@@ in only in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ yl@@ ic acid or insulin , the previous dose of the sulph@@ yl@@ ic acid or insulin can be maintained continuously , except for patients with hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar level ) ; this should be reduced the dose of sulph@@ yl@@ ic acid / insulin or insulin .
this means that the physical insulin is better toler@@ ated and the blood sugar level has to be adjusted better , resulting in type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ ones in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ yl@@ bi@@ d@@ ye , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in studies , the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured that shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which restri@@ cts the blood sugar levels for the dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the trial treatment , the effect of an additional gift of acet@@ one to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ur jacket in a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0,@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was investigated , patients who participated in addition to insulin , a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.14 % in patients who took in addition to placebo .
the most common adverse events in connection with acet@@ cars were se@@ al@@ ant , infections of the upper respir@@ atory ( path@@ ologic ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thesis ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be applied to patients who may not react to patients with liver problems compared to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency ( high K@@ et@@ onic mirror - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for the placing of vehicles in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to white , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin @-@ type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is adjusted with insulin and in@@ compatibility due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
to use Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one for patients under 18 years of age are no data available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients receiving at least one risk factor ( e.g. from earlier heart attack or sy@@ mptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) to develop a de@@ compens@@ ated con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest recommended dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , particularly those with reduced car@@ di@@ aler reserves .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and oils in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was carried out .
this study showed an increase in reports of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver values are as soon as possible .
if a patient is developed that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , ti@@ red@@ ness , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver values to check .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one will continue to be re@@ directed to the main laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ ed @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be her@@ al@@ ded by grease deposits and in some cases linked to a liquid re@@ mun@@ eration .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ l@@ ution , a lower reduction in central hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ on treatment ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin sensitivity , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one increased as oral divisions , or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sulph@@ yl@@ ic acid or as a dual @-@ level combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ages of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
following the market launch , under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ ac@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , including a occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a diabet@@ ic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a to be aware of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a to report patients over distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acuity ; an ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered into account .
in a summary analysis of messages indisp@@ ens@@ able events in the bone @-@ brood , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
the calculated fra@@ cture @-@ incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study of over 3.5 years on investig@@ ating cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patients ) with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes for a pregnancy or occurs in case of pregnancy , treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for investigation of the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical Dynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phenol and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. oral contrast ratio , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ s ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( an cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induction ) resulted in a lowering of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 54 % .
this is due to the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one who decreased hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin @-@ resistant viruses and reduces the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for red@@ dish growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data not estimated ) .
this lead to a temporary change in the tower and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic effect .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ st@@ iege stood over the three times the upper limit of the normal range than below placebo but more rarely than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ bi@@ d@@ ye .
in an out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ v@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency was 1.6 % higher than in placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or bz@@ w .
since its market launch , rarely has been reported on con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more frequently when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin @-@ suff@@ iciency in the An@@ am@@ n@@ aval .
there was a summary analysis of Mess@@ ages of random@@ ized events in terms of bone @-@ controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medication .
over a period of 3.5 years current pro@@ active study , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day had no symptoms .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to work specific kernel recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ ic pro@@ lifer@@ ative re@@ pt@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which results in the animal model to an increased insulin @-@ sensitive sensitivity of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces Glu@@ cos@@ a production in the liver and increases the peripheral scor@@ ching dev@@ alu@@ ation in case of insulin @-@ resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time two years after the beginning of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) in 69 % of patients treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was adjusted in in@@ adequate processing phase with insulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who still only received insulin ; a reduction of the insulin one group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one group was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statistically significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ents showed a statistically significant decline in comparison with the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was checked in a small , based on 18 weeks for type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical studies , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and slightly lower , however clin@@ ically un@@ significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel .

compared to Pl@@ az@@ ebo , no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was detected , whereas Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de di@@ min@@ ished values were observed .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de mirror , this both via a effect on the Tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic Tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ al out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were randomised in addition to existing anti@@ diabet@@ ic and cardiovascular therapy .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one gets quickly res@@ or@@ ously , with the top concentration on the un@@ changeable Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about the thre@@ e@@ fold of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in intervention trials , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical Dynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phenol and met@@ form@@ in .

according to the legal application of radioactive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mark@@ er was found mainly in barri@@ ers ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elim@@ ination process of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , while the entire active Met@@ abol@@ ite is between 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ite are lower than in patients with reduced ren@@ al function , however , the rates of oral cle@@ ance of the matern@@ al cle@@ aring is similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and apes , agree to repeated administration volume enlargement with hem@@ at@@ l@@ ution , an@@ emia and reversible ex@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac disease .
this is due to be due to the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin @-@ resist@@ ency and therefore reduces the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for red@@ dish growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( with male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder cancer were induced .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was investigated in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as can produce no insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not capable of using insulin .
after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els , which indicates that blood sugar levels have been lowered similarly to another human@@ kind .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who may possibly react sensitive to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane must be adjusted , if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can result in the blood sugar ( the full list is to be found ) .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane weigh over the risks associated with diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for placing the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane throughout the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin @-@ products are usually taken once or twice daily when a fast initial effect will be desired with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be applied at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the whole dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar setting is significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin @-@ phase , insulin @-@ phase ( insulin @-@ insulin , insulin @-@ insulin , insulin or insulin @-@ insulin ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNS compared to insulin @-@ animal origin ) means that a change in dosage is required .
when changing Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose adjustment is necessary , it can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with whom hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal by animal insulin had reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced , or unlike its predecessor insulin .
before travel , which should go over several time zones , the patient should pick up the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead to other times , insulin and meals must be taken or taken .
the doctor must therefore consider possible inter@@ actions in the therapy and en@@ quiries about any patient after other of them .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be gradually developing : • Easy hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ias can be treated by oral intake of gl@@ ucose and gl@@ ucose levels .
diabet@@ ics should therefore always have trau@@ ma , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its or sugar fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ias can be treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Gl@@ uc@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven assistant or through gl@@ ucose , which is given to intraven@@ ous by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum will be reached within 2 to 8 hours and the overall duration is up to 24 hours .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d cannot be applied in patients who are possibly sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d must be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for placing the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d into the European Union .
if two types of insulin have to be mixed , first the amount of the fast @-@ acting insulin is required , then the amount of insulin @-@ insulin is required .
3 If the alternating to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d is required during the patient &apos;s dose , it can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .

the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation , since it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( one other drugs for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of Adenauer ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ur@@ ine levels lie in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who supplies Aden@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of 80 mg once daily , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) of patients who were once daily 120 mg once daily , with the last three measurements worth ur@@ inary acid levels in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart failure in the pre@@ history , possibly an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and tox@@ ins .
the primary wiring point was in each study the proportion of patients where the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) were included .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ at@@ ine value to study starts from ≤ 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant over@@ su@@ peri@@ ority relative to lowering serum levels below 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) , as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed a statistically significant over@@ flow lower than 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) statistically significant over@@ su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) received , were group@@ ed for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.001 versus 80 mg
lowering the serum levels of serum levels at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed at the physician attendance in week 2 and maintain permanently over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um@@ bil@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney @-@ functional limitations The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney cancer limit ( d. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy index was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clinical differences with regard to the percentage decrease of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in subjects ( 58 % in group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected from the open renewal study in phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the serum levels decreased to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mol / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients were required in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required for an eye thrust ) .
this was associated with a reduction of po@@ or@@ k@@ not@@ ch size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of po@@ cht@@ ing no@@ des up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with February ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration period ( AU@@ C ) was proportional to the administration easier and multi@@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after intake a simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clinical change in the percentage of serum was observed , so that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparently ste@@ ady ste@@ ady state volume ( V@@ pp / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma rot@@ ates of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approx . 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bonds of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached via the concentration width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

adv@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted with kidney or liver in order to prevent de@@ duction of tran@@ spl@@ ant exposure through the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore the results of a clinical study was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator of efficacy was the number of patients where the transplan@@ tation was dropped from a year ( by example , for example , a new organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , shorter studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant transplan@@ tation was performed and examined how adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .
Tre@@ aties ( cit@@ adel ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a blood sugar level ( hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ) , diabetes , higher potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and ins@@ om@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nia ) .
patients with frequent hyper@@ sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , mac@@ ro@@ id antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or one of the other components may not be applied to be enrolled .
patients and doctors have to be careful if others ( in particular some vegetable ) medicines will be taken at the same time with adv@@ agra@@ f as the downstream dose or dose may be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ ity @-@ intensive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should provide this medicine or make changes in the immun@@ ity @-@ intensive therapy .
because of clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ant reactions or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ du@@ - or overhead .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ tile formulation and the respective daily dosage ; provisions of formulation or the regime should only be performed under eng@@ ined control of one in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dos@@ ages must be carried out in order to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dose of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be primarily based on clinical assessment of abl@@ ation and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley should be controlled by changing and controlled via two weeks after change@@ over .
on Day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley level , was comparable to both ren@@ al and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant patients .
careful and repeated controls in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ king controls are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , to ensure reasonable substance exposure in direct tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the pre @-@ dose pre @-@ dose may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in the first postoperative phase no oral intake of pharmac@@ euticals , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the manufacture of an infusion solution ) can be initiated using a dose of ca .
duration of the application for suppression of transplan@@ tation , the immune response has to be observed ; therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation , corneal transplan@@ tation therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
another dose adjustments can be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ ization of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation therapy should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted a tran@@ spl@@ ant receiver of twice daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily dosage of lessons , so this change@@ over must be carried out at a time of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant According to a change@@ over of other immun@@ om@@ res@@ si@@ va to adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with kidney transplan@@ tation is recommended for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
transplan@@ tation For adult patients who are converted to adv@@ agra@@ f is an or@@ ale initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once a day in the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant suffer@@ ers have no clinical experience with adv@@ ances in lung cancer , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ spl@@ ant patients , came to pan@@ cre@@ mat@@ ured patients in a oral initi@@ al@@ ant dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in intest@@ inal transplan@@ tation in an oral initi@@ al@@ ant dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining blood levels in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function when the kidney function does not influence the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ine potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ ine mirror , recommended calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f at the change@@ over of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ine - a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the level mirror in full blood the dose should be based on clinical assessment of per@@ sever@@ ance and toler@@ ability in individual cases of whole blood @-@ tac@@ kling @-@ tac@@ ular mirror checks .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls from the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us canal levels during the first two weeks after Tran@@ splan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during the maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ us mirror from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be changes after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ age adjustment , amendments to the immune @-@ intensive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances which could change the tac@@ ular fi@@ b@@ ulation concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low level Clear@@ ance , adaptations of the dose may require several days , until the Ste@@ ady State did occur .
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley levels should not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ant usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with hing@@ es - and warm transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent detection of liver , ren@@ al and cardi@@ ac gra@@ fts , blood concentrations in the range from 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft reactions or other side effects , which may occur in the sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub or exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ tile formulation and the respective daily dosage ; provisions of formulation or the regime should only be performed under eng@@ ined control of one in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft reactions , which had been treated with other immun@@ oph@@ en@@ si@@ va , there are no clinical data for ret@@ ali@@ ated formulation of adv@@ agra@@ f .
to the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft reactions in adult heart gra@@ ft , and tran@@ spl@@ ant @-@ gra@@ ft in childhood are still no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of the possible inter@@ actions that lead to a down@@ turn of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is the intake of vegetable preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) , or to avoid other plant remedi@@ es during treatment with adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood has been instructed , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood level can be subjected to such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was a case of co@@ al@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y , chamber or sept@@ um@@ atic t@@ roph@@ ic was observed , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are a treatment of cor@@ ti@@ ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid over@@ loading and oil .
as in other immun@@ om@@ res@@ si@@ va the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of p@@ res such as head@@ ache , changing awareness of forces , forces and vision should show a radical investigation ( e.@@ g .
da Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ cap@@ tures , ret@@ ains , l@@ act@@ ose contain , is provided in patients with the rare her@@ ds@@ act@@ ate g@@ act@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase defic@@ iency , or gl@@ ucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous application of medicines or vegetable heal@@ ers are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 which can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
therefore , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood level can be used for simultaneous gift of substances which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the tac@@ tile dose to maintaining consistent concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong inter@@ changeable action was used with An@@ tim@@ yk@@ ot@@ ica as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and Sil@@ icon@@ duc@@ ol as well as the Macro@@ lid anti@@ bi@@ otic Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics showed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by inhibit@@ ing the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal consistency .
high @-@ speed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute remedy re@@ actions , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid arthritis , and thus increasing the hor@@ m@@ onal exposure , it is particularly careful in decisions concerning the prevention measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and their half @-@ time delay .
the results of a small number of investigations on transplan@@ tation patients do not provide any note that in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ oph@@ en@@ si@@ va an increased risk for un@@ wanted events associated with regard to the course and the result of pregnancy .
in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns is advis@@ able to potential adverse effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially as regards its effect on the kidneys ) .
it is the risk of birth of birth ( &lt; Week 37 ) and hyper@@ tension in new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the real @-@ acting profile of immun@@ oph@@ res@@ si@@ va often can be demonstrated because of the patients and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ u@@ bility and the high binding to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot@@ ein can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed .

adv@@ ances is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII @-@ related , inn@@ ate ble@@ eding disorder ) .
dosage and frequency of application will be addressed to whether the treatment is applied to the treatment of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or prevention of blood patients .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII defic@@ iency , which causes blood cl@@ ill@@ ings like ble@@ eding in the joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell that has been incorporated into a gene ( DNA ) that it is capable of formation of the human ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
adv@@ ices is another approved drug in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but is produced differently , so that medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe up to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was examined for prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages and surgical procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the efficacy of adv@@ ances in the prevention of blood ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood cl@@ amps with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common adverse events of advanced ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are Schwin@@ n , head@@ aches , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ances may not be used in patients who may possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human cl@@ ots factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster protein , or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG to submit approval for the entry into the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ situations depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ Man@@ gels , according to the place and the extent of blood and clinical condition of patients .
in the following h@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII activity shall not drop under the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patients is over .
during the treatment process , a reasonable dose and frequency of inj@@ ections will be appropriate to determine the factor VIII plasma .
individual patients can differ in response to factor VIII , various in vivo recovery can reach different sem@@ inal times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of blood patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kilogram of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ h should not be achieved or if blood is not domin@@ ate with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if necessary for an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be handled .
the administration speed should be done according to the patient &apos;s examination , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always related to pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk of risk within the first 20 exposure days is dependent on the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 Ex@@ positi@@ onal days and an am@@ orous inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occur of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare ess@@ ay of the hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and n@@ urs@@ ing time .
one of the greatest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who are all treated with previously untreated patient who have a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very sel@@ dom ( frequency based on the available data not devi@@ ated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients has been calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) ; the unexpected drop of the blood cl@@ ots factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els entered post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E infusion .
during all the time , blood cl@@ ots have been calcul@@ ating , both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed adequate values on the 15 @-@ day postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed a low In@@ hibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnostic severe up to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was determined by prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) to a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
previously untreated patients of a current clinical study enrolled 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients for inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of cont@@ am@@ inated protein was analyzed by the study of antibodies against those proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a lasting peak of anti @-@ chlorine cells , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that had an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the initial appearance of ur@@ ia , p@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ oph@@ ile gran@@ ul@@ ocy@@ tes were reported in several repet@@ itive product ex@@ positions within the study .

156 In case of issue of blood results , the factor VIII below should not fall below the specified plasma activity ( in % or in / ml ) .
based on the data available since the initial roll@@ ment of available data , the CH@@ MP has continued to be positive , but consider that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the Security Council of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which makes a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months , decided that the allowance for 5 years should apply a further extension procedure .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited adopted the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company will res@@ ume its application for marketing authorization to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the wheat parts ( tissues , the other structures in the body combines and supported ) of it .
this is a kind of virus that &apos;s genetic so changed that it can bear a gene into the cells of the body .
with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ ine , this is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which was so changed that there is no copies of himself , and therefore no infections can be redeemed in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein that is formed from the non @-@ faul@@ ty human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually carries the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein doesn &apos;t work properly , and the cancer cells can grow further and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient in front of the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer in the sub@@ division , in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers to the question of the company , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on the testing of initially submitted documentation , the CH@@ MP created a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
the CH@@ MP opinion was not suff@@ iciently demonstrated that injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors provides benefits for the patients .
the Committee had further concerns relating to the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not suff@@ iciently demonstrated that adv@@ ances can be established in a reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who are in a way contact with the patient , are harmful .
the company used the CH@@ MP not knowing the response consequences for patients who currently participated in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; modified drug release &quot; means that the tablets are assembled so that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used for the treatment of the seasonal allerg@@ y rhin@@ itis ( loc@@ ust@@ u@@ cking , caused by a allerg@@ y against poll@@ en ev@@ oked inflamm@@ ation of the nose ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( clo@@ g@@ ged nose ) .
for adults and teenagers over 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( cr@@ ammed nose ) , are pl@@ otted out .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be re@@ charged on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the loc@@ ust@@ rade symptoms who have been reported in the treatment before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the loc@@ ali symptoms except the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose reported patients that Aer@@ in@@ aze revenues , compared with a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.9 % in the patients receiving P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a showed , the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared with 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common adverse events of aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( hyper@@ tension ) , ore@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( appet@@ ite ) , const@@ ip@@ ation , fatigue , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nia ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ e@@ ity ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze must not be applied in patients who may possibly over@@ pressure ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components , against ad@@ sor@@ ge active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied .
Aer@@ in@@ aze can also not be applied in patients who suffer from a bott@@ angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( over@@ function of thy@@ ro@@ id ) or already caused a ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic strike ( caused by a brain circulation ) or have a risk for a ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic punch .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company SP Europe granted approval for the placing of aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , it can be swal@@ lowed up in the whole ( i.e. without having to cr@@ ushed or cut off ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied to children under the age of 12 due to the lack of data and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin can take time .
after a decline in sw@@ elling of mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper breath@@ s the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin contains the medicine also con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy .
this is based on the alph@@ am@@ im@@ et@@ ical activity of combined application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with other v@@ as@@ cri@@ mp , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Eph@@ ed@@ rin , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , nap@@ kins , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient @-@ shaft and the data are not sufficient to arrange relevant recommendations to the dosage .
safety and the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data are not sufficient to arrange appropriate Recommen@@ dations on the Dos@@ age .
patients must be informed that the treatment of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or from Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or et@@ w@@ ai@@ gen other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a ampli@@ fication of the head@@ ache ) must be removed .
for the treatment of the following patient groups : patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ orph@@ ine , Diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder cancer , or bronze statue in the An@@ am@@ nese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is carried out at least 48 hours prior to the conduct of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ amine , otherwise positive reactions have to prevent adverse reactions to skin activities or reduce their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given , however , no clinical inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ ic testing , no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo could be detected , ir@@ respective of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enzyme was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines may not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ conc@@ ality of the application of aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , yet with a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison with normal population .
because Re@@ productive studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans and are not applied on the basis of v@@ as@@ o@@ fer@@ mented properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should however clari@@ fy it that in very rare cases , it can come to an impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
the symptoms can vary between a tick depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ no@@ e , di@@ min@@ ded mental attention , cy@@ an@@ esth@@ esia , Kom@@ a , cardiovascular coll@@ u@@ ity ) and a tick @-@ stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , Con@@ vul@@ tures ) with potential let@@ ting .

a tick @-@ stim@@ ulation is particularly likely to children , as well as At@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ fulness , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ vi@@ re and - Dil@@ at@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile a P selection of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells in endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
when a single dose trial with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ 5 mg no effect on standard measurement sizes of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily , no increased frequency of stro@@ kes in comparison to placebo were noted .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can reveal another li@@ stic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS detection .
it took 1,@@ 248 patients at the age of 12 to 78 years with seasonal allerg@@ y rhin@@ itis , with 414 patients Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies , hist@@ amin@@ ant efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determines from the total score for symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cu@@ ous membran@@ es ) , significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ ist with P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in terms of sw@@ elling effect , determines from the nas@@ al mu@@ cu@@ ous effect , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic groups .
as part of a single dose trial for pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Aer@@ in@@ dler , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has been demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy subjects over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ gi@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , was reached on Day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ etic multi @-@ level study , which was performed with the formulation of a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was badly damaged .
a components @-@ interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin according to the sole gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin bio@@ equivalent was the exposure to the administration of an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies on security sp@@ ic@@ ology , for tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to re@@ productive applications , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .
the combination had no bigger tox@@ icity than their individual components , and observed effects were generally related to the content of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
in re@@ productive @-@ sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was not ter@@ ated in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

for children ages 1 to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once daily taken in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or bz@@ w .
for children ages six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or bz@@ w .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials with seasonal allergi@@ es and two studies in patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
the efficacy was measured by using the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of qu@@ akes , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were presented to prove that the body makes the sy@@ rup and the solution to remove and remove the melting tray in the same way as the tablets and the use of children un@@ th@@ ink@@ ably .
for allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us became an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia , the decrease of sympt@@ om score after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to placebo patients treated with placebo .
A@@ erial may not be used in patients who may possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a licence for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , for the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allerg@@ y rhin@@ itis ( the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be taken according to the previous illness and can be terminated following the sympt@@ om of symptoms and resum@@ ed with its resum@@ ption .
the persist@@ ing allergi@@ es ( the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended during the allerg@@ y time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , with the benefit of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol is not increased the most effective effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should however clari@@ fy that it can come in very rare cases that may lead to an impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported as patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were more common than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most frequent tri@@ but@@ s was treated with 5.9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.9 % of patients treated with placebo .
a multi@@ dose study that were administered at up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine different clinical dose ) were not observed clin@@ ically relevant effects .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ cells / b@@ oph@@ ile a P sel@@ ess of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 45 mg daily ( the ninth time of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
when an individual dos@@ sier with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ 5 mg no effect on standard measurement sizes of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ ats , Nas@@ en@@ rol@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , Tr@@ än@@ en@@ flow and S@@ elling of the pal@@ ate as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z at the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can alternatively be divided in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the total score of the questionn@@ aire to strengthen the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ sub@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden of seasonal rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia was examined as a representative for further forms of Ur@@ ti@@ ci@@ ia since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology remains similar in the different forms of similar forms and chronic patients can be pro@@ spective .
as the hist@@ amine release is a potential factor in all the ari@@ ari@@ al cases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is expected to improve the symptoms of the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , as well as other forms of the Ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia , which is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the decrease of size and number of Qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first time interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ mel@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , the minority was not affected by anti@@ hist@@ amin@@ ika , from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics study where patients treated with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis of Rhin@@ itis was comparable to 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no liability for clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , it was not identified for Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ren@@ al enzyme , however , that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in vivo @-@ CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ sier with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine with a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( gre@@ asy , cal@@ ory rich breakfast ) does not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the study of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin performed in a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regards to the tox@@ icity studies of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies on security sp@@ ic@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin doesn &apos;t recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals to reduce symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cription doctor ought to be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see below section 4.4 ) and that no data are presented , which support a treatment of inf@@ ectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory diseases or anatom@@ ical anom@@ al@@ ies , the diagnosis of An@@ am@@ orph@@ osis , physical investigations and respective laboratory tests should play a role .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years ab@@ oli@@ zes des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and learn a higher substr@@ ate ( see under section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed , is identical to the children that met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zes the normal .
this medicine contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ d@@ entary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , gl@@ ucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ absor@@ bing or a suc@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suff@@ iciency does not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were given in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , with the benefit of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not increased the most effective effect of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the total hardness of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group , like the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , were treated with placebo .
a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents , administered by up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine different clinical dose ) were not observed clin@@ ically relevant effects .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who came to an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment , received a daily dose of 1.25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children can be similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for adults can extra@@ pol@@ ishes for children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study involving multiple outlets in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 45 mg daily ( the ninth time of clinical dose ) than ten days in adults showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of stro@@ kes in comparison to placebo were noted .

in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the decrease of size and number of Qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first time interval .
the spread of this restricted phenomenon was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ cas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ etic multi @-@ dose study with the si@@ onal im@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which is restricted to met@@ abolic ster@@ il@@ ions .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6 to 6 hours approximately 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a scheduled half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no liability for a clinical @-@ relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine at pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

A@@ f@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect the flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a strain of influenza , which could cause a future pan@@ demic .
an influenza pan@@ es breaks out when a new tribe of influenza pan@@ es that can easily spread from human beings , because people cannot have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; physical foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is able to compos@@ e faster antibodies in a contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as a foreign ) , are cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
one of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this reduces the scope of clinical data base to assess the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA region for pre @-@ pan@@ ic vacc@@ ines .
if you take part in a clinical study and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor .
for further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is applied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ ode@@ ficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are infected with accumulated immun@@ ode@@ ficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ gen@@ ase is as a solution for inclusion , but this cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of these combination was not studied .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has chosen the an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has said that the virus will appeal to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gen@@ ase is based according to body weight .
gen@@ eric reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines at a low level .
AIDS is not to heal AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system , and thus creating the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , however without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not been treated with prot@@ ease .
this enhanced R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ gen@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had taken former prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentrations of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ us@@ load ) or the change of vir@@ al load after treatment .
in the studies of patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors had already taken a vir@@ al load of 400 copies / ml compared to placebo but no@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
with children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ al load , however , of the children who had been treated previously with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , only very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated previously with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , linked to R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ gen@@ ase the vir@@ us@@ load after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase along with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of vir@@ us@@ load after four weeks as in the patients receiving its previous prot@@ ease :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ aly@@ sis ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , skin r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase should not be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive to am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
atri@@ um must also be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a vegetable preparation for treatment of depression ) or drugs , as well as A@@ gen@@ ase , and in high concentrations in the blood of health are harmful .
as with other drugs against HIV , patients suffering from disease progression or oste@@ o@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) or a immune activ@@ ating agent ( symptoms of infection that are caused by the rest@@ orative immune system ) .
the conclu@@ ding Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to treat patients treated with HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks associated with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
A@@ gen@@ ase is generally taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee pointed out that the benefit from as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease of inhibit@@ ors .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons , only limited information .
in October 2000 the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited approval for the placing on placing A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
gen@@ eric is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic boo@@ sters of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r should be performed , considering the individual vir@@ al resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the availability of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the unic@@ am@@ avi@@ r solution is less than capsule ; therefore A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution can not be inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended adult dose is 600 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ s@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ ce@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other Prot@@ ocols was not studied with children .
atri@@ um is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the absence of data to in@@ compreh@@ ension and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be used in patients with mild or less liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals , which possess a low therapeutic width and also represent the substr@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ unding 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation date ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy should not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including the treatment with atri@@ ots prevents non @-@ risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be applied together with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , an increased risk of severe liver ab@@ out@@ comes with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the related communication information of this medicine .
patients with previously restricted liver function including a chronic @-@ active Hepatitis show shows a increased incidence of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other gl@@ ucose concentrations to be mistaken about CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects including morph@@ ine C@@ ushing and sou@@ ression of the side function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the pro@@ pul@@ sion of the H@@ MG Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duction of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ er and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is dependent of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of gen@@ eric and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended for the increased risk of al@@ opath@@ y including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods to determine the concentration of active concentration .
in patients who use this medicine at the same time , as@@ gen@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ diction can be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if met@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored in ov@@ at@@ ite symptoms , in particular if even low doses are administered by R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of a tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity of the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ cted in children under the age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
atri@@ ots should be placed at least 5 if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported over the onset of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with medicines that are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. Higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated .
for ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease of ble@@ eding , reports on an increase of ble@@ eding including spontan@@ eous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sen .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ity effect , an anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an infl@@ am@@ atic reaction to as@@ y@@ mptom@@ atic or resi@@ den@@ ial opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical approach or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial equ@@ ology is accepted ( including use of Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immune @-@ Mass @-@ index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) reported .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals , which possess a low therapeutic width and also indicate substr@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ unding 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ates with lower therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with medicines that are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical violation and lead to a resistance development .
in attemp@@ ting to balance the lowest plasma levels through a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often un@@ wanted effects were observed in the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation date ) The serum level of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ ed by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with cur@@ sor ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation date ) .
if a patient already takes loc@@ ust , the am@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ onic level , if possible , check the vir@@ al load and take the loc@@ ust .
a dose adaptation for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with am@@ b@@ ats@@ avi@@ r ( see also don@@ keys below ) .
508 % increases , for C@@ max against 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily to prove the efficacy and in@@ conc@@ ality of this treatment schem@@ atic .
52 % lower if Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( 750 m@@ g. twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ s@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ s@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended to be a eng@@ aging monitoring , since the efficacy and infin@@ ity of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic study on the application of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ene , however , due to the ant@@ a@@ unt component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ene it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and ag@@ gen@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , no dose adap@@ tion is required in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with liz@@ ard ir@@ ency in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposition of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ ease of inhibit@@ or and existing limited data are estimated that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin could possibly desc@@ end the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if this drug should be used at the same time , be careful , since Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma must be less effective .
if this medicine is used together , caution is commanded ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed because a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in by 193 % and thus to increase the side effects associated with Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in connected side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ j@@ ut@@ in is used together with A@@ gen@@ ase , to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is pre@@ set .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not carried out but could be increased plasma levels of both medicines in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of f@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily , resulted in an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ ) compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without a simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substr@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied to inter@@ actions in common with A@@ gen@@ ase .
patients should therefore be associated with toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with ac@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase , since it can come to res@@ or@@ ption .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ cor@@ si@@ va which are known as enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can lead to a result of the plasma levels of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ odi@@ pine , arch @-@ pin , arch @-@ pin , ni@@ an@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ pin pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 through am@@ b@@ oh@@ avi@@ r , thus avoi@@ ding the activity and tox@@ icity of this product .
the simultaneous intake with A@@ gen@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration considerably and enh@@ ancing with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with p@@ itu@@ aries , se@@ per@@ sions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsule taken twice daily together with 50 µg of fluor@@ o@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days were decreased , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ brill@@ ation interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of as@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these gl@@ ucose cor@@ ids unless the potential benefits of a treatment of system@@ ic super@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors like Lov@@ ast@@ atin , and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose pro@@ pul@@ sion is strongly dependent of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , they are expected to increase the plasma levels while maintaining A@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opath@@ y including a we@@ al@@ dom@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
there is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as to stabil@@ ization of mirrors , since the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore A@@ gen@@ ase should not be applied together with an oral mal@@ ol@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same application of as@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ ent@@ ous Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is commanded .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ ent@@ ous Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ectors are based on a possible increase in plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to match 3 @-@ 4 times .
if met@@ ad@@ on is administered along with am@@ b@@ oh@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored in ov@@ arian symptoms , especially if even low doses are administered by R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of the same amount , no recommendation can be given , as the am@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is to adapt , when am@@ b@@ lown is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on .
in simultaneous gift of hot or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gen@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or reinforcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r based on hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ diction is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods recommended to conception .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended for simultaneous gift of as@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after a careful re@@ tention of possible uses for the mother in comparison with the potential haz@@ ard risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk activated rats , Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether am@@ b@@ lown avi@@ r over@@ comes in breast milk .
a Re@@ productive study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the in@@ tim@@ ation in the u@@ terus until the end of the n@@ urs@@ ing time Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the post@@ age .
the further development of the offspring including fertil@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r on the parent &apos;s parent .
the in@@ conc@@ ality of A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most of the side effects associated with A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were slightly until moderate , came early in early and led rarely to treatment breaks .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gen@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the under@@ age disease .
most of the side @-@ called adverse events come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease of inhibit@@ or not treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .

anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ una tissue , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ o@@ cer@@ vical o@@ bes@@ ity ( bul@@ lets ) .
not prescribed under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al persons who have been treated with am@@ b@@ oh@@ s in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over a mean duration of 36 weeks , was observed only one case ( sticks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 occurred in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - previously treated patients under am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .

cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose mainly reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune effect , a anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an infl@@ am@@ atic reaction on as@@ y@@ mptom@@ atic or resi@@ den@@ ial opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of PI &apos;s treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gen@@ ase twice a day together with low tum@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) of which were observed among all aspects of tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values , those in patients who received A@@ gen@@ ase together with low dose R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of R@@ it@@ s@@ avi@@ r twice a day : N = 107 ) with prot@@ ease of untreated patients showed about 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analysis systems can be used to evaluate the activity of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm is defined as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / V , I@@ 54@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a increased probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical contact ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to use the current interpre@@ tations for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analysis of clinical data interpre@@ tations can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ation of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies representing diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpre@@ t results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross @-@ resistant against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , clo@@ vi@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r but generally retained .
there are currently data to cross @-@ resistance between am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ r Resist@@ ers , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viruses ( one of them showed resistance to L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulators ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulators ) and Tip@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ulators ) .
in addition , am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors against isol@@ ate ins@@ ulators ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early termination of a vers@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accum@@ ulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can result in the following treatment pieces .
the evidence of the efficacy of ag@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomised open study ( 600 mg twice daily ) together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily associated with lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ert &quot; received .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the research study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis set the non @-@ under@@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time adjusted average change of the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub @-@ wave threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the efficacy of un@@ roasted A@@ gen@@ ase based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution was taken in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was not given a low dose of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI previously treated at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s containing A@@ gen@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase in CD@@ 4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Based on these dates should be considered for the treatment of treatment with PI pen@@ sive benefit from &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ky &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max , by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered along with am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake is influenced by the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large distribution volume , as well as a broken penetration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation system .
this change led to a decrease in the concentration of concentration in plasma , with the amount of fro@@ sted am@@ b@@ lown , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
whereas the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ b@@ lown up remains constant , the percentage of free active components remains in dependence on the aggregate physician at the Ste@@ ady State in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ max , ss @-@ C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines containing CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hib@@ itions or a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when they are given simultaneously with gen@@ eric ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice , or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ available as from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gen@@ ase solution and gen@@ eric capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams basis .
the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al disorder on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
these treatment schem@@ es lead to am@@ b@@ avi@@ r plasma levels which is comparable to healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ epat@@ ocy@@ tes Aden@@ omas and Car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
from this study data on humans , both clinical studies and therapeutic use , however , little indications for the assum@@ ption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , micro@@ core test on rats and chromosomes tolerance in human peripheral ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tes were am@@ b@@ avi@@ r nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously in clinical trials no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase even after the end of treatment .
studies to tox@@ icity in young , which have been treated from an age of 4 days , exhibited both in the control and the am@@ b@@ lown of the animals had a high mortality .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposure that was significantly higher ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposition under therapeutic dosage , however , a series of slight changes , including thy@@ mus@@ ong@@ ation and minor sk@@ el@@ eton changes , observed on a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ ce@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be used in patients with weak or lighter liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .

an increased risk for li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical violation and lead to a resistance development .
508 % increases , for C@@ max against 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ s@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended to be a eng@@ aging monitoring , since the efficacy and infin@@ ity of this combination is not known .
treatment with liz@@ ard ir@@ ency in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposition of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if this medicine is used together , caution is commanded ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed because a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ j@@ ut@@ in is used together with A@@ gen@@ ase , to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are pre@@ set .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ odi@@ pine , arch @-@ pin , arch @-@ pin , ni@@ an@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ pin pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , thus avoi@@ ding the activity and tox@@ icity of this product .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsule taken twice daily together with 50 µg of fluor@@ o@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days were decreased , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ brill@@ ation interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in simultaneous gift of hot or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gen@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or reinforcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from am@@ b@@ avi@@ r to 22 %

in case of an over@@ dosage , the patient is on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) , if necessary , are necessary to initi@@ ate the necessary measures .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ ast@@ ical cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ con@@ cent@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.08 µ@@ M with acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µg / ml ) .
in addition , am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors against isol@@ ate ins@@ ulators ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , it should be considered to be considered to be an expected benefit from an unexpected benefit from &quot; un@@ certain &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase &quot; for the treatment of PI .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ b@@ lown up remains constant , the percentage of free active components remains in dependence on the aggregate physician at the Ste@@ ady State in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ max , ss @-@ C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines containing CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hib@@ itions or a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when they are given simultaneously with gen@@ eric ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al disorder on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .

the availability of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the unic@@ am@@ avi@@ r solution is less than capsule ; therefore A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution can not be inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with the intake of the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ cer@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition there must be no dose recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase solution to take and low dose R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided by these patients groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ b@@ oh@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for use is an application of gen@@ eric solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high @-@ prop@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic content , A@@ gen@@ ase solution is associated with infants and children under 4 years , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration may lead to a competent shirt of the metabolism and possibly result severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia ( z .

if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patients or the sever@@ ity of local skin reaction , a treatment period can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of therapy can be assessed after the re@@ generation of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of treatment .
since there is currently no data about long @-@ term medic@@ inal rates of more than 36 months after treatment , should be found in super@@ fi@@ able bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma and other appropriate treatment forms .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in previously treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine therapy is found .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been investigated for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ants on eyel@@ ids , inside of the nose or ears , or on the front of the lips .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ants on anatom@@ ical spaces outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose on the low @-@ arms and hands do not support efficacy in this application process , therefore a such use is not recommended .
local hood occur frequently , but these reactions have usually come back to intensity in the course of the therapy , or after the onset of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream .
if local Hau@@ tre@@ ats may cause large dis@@ comfort in the patient or are very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 actors and a lower total therapeutic rate was reported as patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ ity res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect adverse effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ ale development , integration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
even though they have not been achieved after a once more dynamic application qu@@ anti@@ fication serum ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given to the application during a stand@@ still .
most commonly used as probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream in connection with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of feeding women ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine patients ) .
most often reported , and possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream in connection with an incidence of 28,@@ 1 % .
the study of 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream treated Bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of the Phase III related side effects are listed below .
the most common , as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream in the context of these studies a reaction on the application of application ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
adverse events that were specified by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of the Phase III I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
this investig@@ ational assessment of clinical evidence shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream often , including Er@@ y@@ ware ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion / sheets / sheets ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
this according to the investig@@ ational assessment of clinical evidence shows that in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream with severe growth ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and heavy ero@@ ds ( 19 % ) came .
for clinical studies in clinical trials for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment place or in the surrounding area .
the dou@@ bt@@ edly unique oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could cause nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically remarkable side effects , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , composed in Hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which normal@@ ized for oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical examination , after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , system@@ ic concentrations of the alpha inter@@ fer@@ ous and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine was detected .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a full healing of f@@ eig@@ ned treatment in a placebo treatment is clearly superior to a placebo @-@ treatment .
in 60 % of patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients were completely healed ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a full healing was achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five times per week for 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tumor were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ able bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
those from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this also remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week @-@ free time period , has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .

Al@@ dar@@ a cream was investigated in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 , with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , placebo n = 313 ) .
in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown during these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks
a minimum system@@ ic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totalled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml during use in the face ( 12.5 mg , 2 bag ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated risk time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; it shows an extended re@@ tention of the medicine in the skin .
data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low in patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent not@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ able bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study to sample tox@@ icity in the rat @-@ plate doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg , significantly reduced the body weight and elevated sp@@ leen weight ; another four months results showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study for car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at least three days a week in@@ duce no tum@@ ors on the use of use .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and not mut@@ ations , is a risk for people because of systematic exposure than very low .

the study was mainly investigated by the safety of the medicine , however , however , its effectiveness was measured ( by reducing the G@@ AG &apos;s concentrations in ur@@ ine and relative to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me increased the G@@ AG &apos;s concentrations in the ur@@ ine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver on the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , abdom@@ inal pain , arth@@ rop@@ ath@@ y ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in li@@ mb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions to the infusion station .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen saturation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ es ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sc@@ rub@@ bing .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react in patients who may not react heavily over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction ) , do not be applied .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will update every year all new information that may potentially be announced , and this summary will be required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards the reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ enzyme Europe B.V. an authorization for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ als cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ heads , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed for long @-@ time enzy@@ mes in patients with a safe diagnosis of a Mu@@ iz@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ d I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase defic@@ iency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ met@@ able met@@ abolic diseases .
if the patient can increase the initial rate of 2 E / kg / h , if the patient is wearing this , all 15 minutes can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 kg / kg / h .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults aged 65 years was not determined and no dosing system can be recommended .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency has not been determined and no dosing system can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop inf@@ usi@@ vely reactions , which are defined as each in the context of the infusion level , which occurs during infusion or by the end of the infusion level ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored continuously , and the infusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , where re@@ anim@@ ate facilities are now available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase form , usually within 3 months from the course of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usi@@ onist reaction , must be treated with care of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience in regard to the treatment of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity may be c@@ auti@@ ous because of the theoretical increased risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ lock ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ences of inf@@ usi@@ onist reactions .
in case of light or medium @-@ severe inf@@ usi@@ ans reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be vo@@ iced and / or a reduction of infusion rate on half of the infusion rate , where the response has occurred .
in the case of a single , severe inf@@ usi@@ ous reaction , the infusion must be stopped , until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is necessary .
infusion rate can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate when the reaction has occurred , resum@@ ed .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ c@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase consists .
animal experimental studies do not leave to direct or indirect impacts on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data about new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ated against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , are highly recommended , during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
side effects in clinical trials were classified predominantly as inf@@ usi@@ ble reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants below 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
un@@ wanted pharmac@@ ies in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and of its extension at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequency : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respir@@ atory trac@@ ts and lungs in the pre@@ history occurred severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ els , respir@@ atory and fac@@ ial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted Medic@@ inal impacts in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which have been reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly serious deteri@@ oration and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came within 3 months after the treatment to a ser@@ op@@ version , whereby it came to a ser@@ re version during the age of 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to premature extin@@ ction from the study ) in 13 / 45 patients were demonstr@@ able due to radio@@ immun@@ isation ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay , including 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ re version .
patients with missing up to low anti@@ body level showed a robust reduction in G@@ AG Spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n , whereas in patients with high antibody tit@@ ers a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n was set up .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ally neutral to low neutr@@ al@@ izing effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed not to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse reactions , even if the occurr@@ ence of adverse reactions were typically associated with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasons for the enzyme therapy is in one for the Hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ sis of the acute sub@@ str@@ ate and preventing an additional accum@@ ulation due to the en@@ cum@@ ulation of enzy@@ mes .
after intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and cells into ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled study in 45 patients at the age of 6 @-@ 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of the patients were random@@ ized , the majority of the patients ranged from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were randomised to recru@@ it if they had a for@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ ator@@ ial volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walk in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were recruited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me received an improvement in lung function and the ability that is shown in the following table .
in an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected FE@@ V is not significantly less than this period clin@@ ically significantly and the absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of increasing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atomic clo@@ ths of treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decline in the G@@ AG mirror revealed in Har@@ n ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ gen@@ eous path@@ ology of patients , clin@@ ically significant changes , clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy variable ( compared to expected ) , course in 6 @-@ minute test ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly security and pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was investigated at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with heavy course type and 4 with the middle course type ) .
in four patients the dosing was increased due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n Week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients showed an increase in size ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form had only limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations into the dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ es were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusion ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ es is equal .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) is any new information that will be available each year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine is updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical profile of patients at the age of 5 was similar to those in elderly and less affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( one other drugs against cancer ) where cancer is not re@@ produc@@ ible &quot; ( caused by surgery alone cannot be removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( caused by surgery alone ) and spreads very easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who have not been treated before , in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously applied other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies than all@@ any treatment .
to reduce side effects , patients during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , in addition to the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , an &quot; anti @-@ emet@@ ry &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid defic@@ iency ) .
in patients whose blood is changed , or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be applied , or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA , so that the cells divide the cells .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ ins in its active form is lighter than in healthy cells , as in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the disease and a longer duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant min@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study on 456 patients who had not yet received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non@@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had already been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( one other medicines for cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( one more drugs against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , survived an average of 12.3 months , compared with 9.3 months in general administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had already received chemotherapy , the average survival rate was 8.3 months compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el at 7.9 months .
in both studies , however , patients who do not affect the record epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , in which the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta can be found longer than with the same medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the company of Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. an authorization for the market traffic of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each bottle contains 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the yield bottle and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is indicated for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma apart from the overwhelming re@@ epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic breast cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( CO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion with a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as infusion with a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after the treatment of P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ia - infusion in the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ car@@ cin@@ oma according to previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F was administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion with a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
for the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reaction , the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ looked @-@ free gift , as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ es must be taken at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid and intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for further 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ y@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also need a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third assessment cycle .
in patients who received P@@ emet@@ re@@ ins , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and one th@@ rom@@ atic en@@ um@@ eration .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new therapy cycle , a dose of dos@@ ages must be held in consideration - the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood disorders or maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predicted therapy cycles .
after the recovery , the patients must be treated according to the references in Tab@@ les 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 blood .
patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity at least 3 ( except for neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient must be used before treatment .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if patients after 2 doses of hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs at the occurr@@ ence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies show no note that in the age of 65 years of age , or compared to patients at the age of 65 , an elevated side ris@@ i@@ - ko was formed .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ defin@@ ite and effectiveness .
in clinical studies , patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to adjust the dose adjustments based on all patients with recommended dose adjustments .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; to the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in cases of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) was not especially studied in studies .
patients must be administered in terms of the bone mass , and P@@ emet@@ re@@ bo@@ xed must not be administered to patients , before whose total neut@@ rop@@ es have a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the t@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ ten@@ se has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neutral number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ oms and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as observed in the previous therapy cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity like Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was used when a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore all patients have to be treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed patients , foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ y@@ - lak@@ es@@ tic measure to be treated with reduced tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al suff@@ iciency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ eic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and impair@@ ment ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for treatment with p@@ emet@@ rec@@ t is required to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ value for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ ins ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , where these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including the de@@ hydr@@ ation of hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid - collection in trans@@ cellular space a drainage in front of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment should be observed .
5 serious kar@@ di@@ ovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ lics , if this drug is usually given in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application is atten@@ u@@ ed ( except yellow fever , these vacc@@ ination is not recommended ) ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the re@@ productive ability by P@@ emet@@ re@@ ins , men should be pointed out in front of the treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted on how to get to the sperm failure .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) to a reduced P@@ emet@@ o@@ idal selection with the result of a pro@@ lifer@@ ative mac@@ ular de@@ position of adverse events .
therefore , be careful if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) must be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and minimum , 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ emet@@ re@@ formers must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the immune status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance rate of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed with pregnant women , but as in an@@ gu@@ ile anti@@ metabol@@ ites are expected to occur severe in pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ bo@@ xed not may be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful re@@ jection of the user to the mother and of the risk for the s@@ ard@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive ability by p@@ emet@@ re@@ ins , men should be pointed out before the treatment course , advice regarding the sperm rate .
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ eries are transferred to breast milk and un@@ wanted effects in the n@@ urs@@ ed inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .

in a third study all@@ i was compared with 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 had a mean weight loss of 4.8 kg , with an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i , a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .
the most common adverse events of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , Fl@@ atus ( winch ) with chair pressure , chair pressure , o@@ ily / o@@ dys@@ sey , dra@@ g@@ ings ( winds ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winch ) and soft chairs .

in combination with war@@ mb@@ s or other or@@ ally anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal@@ ized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta carot@@ ene remained in the standardis@@ ed area .
however , the patient should be recommended to take a supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vit@@ amine intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers were observed , at the same time Or@@ list@@ at received , a lower decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse impacts on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and depend on pharmac@@ ological effects of the medicine , since the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporarily .
the complexity are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of known adverse events that were detected after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of certain extent .
† It is pl@@ au@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to def@@ aults in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects .
single doses of 800@@ mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight people , without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of calculated cases of or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dos@@ ation , no side effects or similar adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on examinations on humans and animal , of a fast response of a system@@ ic effect , which can be attributed to li@@ pas@@ cal properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen diameter and the upper d@@ int@@ estine from cov@@ al@@ ent bonds to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic lip@@ ase .
clinical trials was derived from clinical trials , that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food @-@ fet@@ ch is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ thes@@ ic , fet@@ al @-@ induced nutrition .
the primary parameters , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was calculated as follows : as a percentage of the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as proportion of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value of 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value of 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change in the LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is applied in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medic@@ inal product that can be used as anti @-@ emet@@ ry ) .
the use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since the effects in this age group is not enough information .
this means that the active ingredient prevents one chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) to prevent the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adult , chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which have strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 by 223 ) , compared with 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron treated patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for placing the market of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting near vig@@ or@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer illness .
the efficacy of al@@ xi to the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on image , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ lig@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored according to injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful not to extend the gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or tend to an extension .
in connection with any other chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics gift , al@@ xi is to be used to treat nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy , nor for treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron resistant to tum@@ ours activity of five investigated chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady concentration of phosph@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , an CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist analysis it was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ ox@@ et@@ ub@@ ine , ox@@ et@@ ine , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , as@@ id@@ in , ran@@ iti@@ din , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) did not have significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied with pregnant women unless the doctor should be deemed necessary .
in clinical studies the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of watching adverse events ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with al@@ xi were related , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ itu@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing of experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequency values of adverse events were observed , as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose of active relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis but probably no effective therapy for an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dos@@ ation .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients were treated with ≤ 50 mg / m2 D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 intraven@@ ous phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hour ) , which was given to Day 1 without D@@ und@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study there were 667 patients who received a strongly eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 mg / m2 of Cy@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were given to Day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly eto@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables :
in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were similar to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ onic and Rep@@ ol@@ ate isation of I@@ on@@ enk@@ ins and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg in single doses .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentration as a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average terminal penalty of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time turn ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg when dogs and cancer patients are proportional .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the intra@@ ocular tumor patients ranged between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) increases from pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
out of the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist sim@@ ulations that once a daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days , overall exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached a result after a single intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the classification of 0.75 mg higher .
approximately 40 % of the kidneys should be eliminated and roughly 50 % are transformed into two primary Met@@ abol@@ ite , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for Met@@ abol@@ ism , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower case , the I@@ so@@ enzyme CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous individual dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose found within 144 hours in ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as a non @-@ altered active substance increased about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous mon@@ ast@@ ine projection , the total body size 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ ance were 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in cases with severe liver function , the terminal elim@@ ination of the terminal elim@@ ination and average system@@ ic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered enough about the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies demonstrate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block at very high concentrations of hed@@ ron channels , which are involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the action period .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose has been given in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure of human exposure , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ m ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as ) and skin cancer .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and because Alo@@ xi is appointed for one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of these results is small rated for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative assessment in which the pro@@ hibit@@ ing of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C expressed by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon is an organic medic@@ inal drug named Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same practice , it should be similar to the EU ( also called &quot; reference age &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( one of vir@@ al inf@@ ectious liver disease ) .
for a micro@@ scope of micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation points the liver tissue damage points , also the values of the liver enzy@@ mes Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which one gene was introduced into the gene for the formation of the drug .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon set up data that indicate the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the medicine , effectiveness , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study to patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference to 455 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no indication of the virus caused by the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns are expressed as soon as the data for the stability of the active substance and the pharmaceutical products were not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C which spoke in the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease in more patients returned to more than with the reference company ; Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the study was introduced to the examination of the question , to what extent the medicine is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibody - special proteins - against drug ) , does not vali@@ date adequate .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ et@@ igo ( one with pit@@ sten@@ osis in@@ fer@@ ior skin infection ) and small in@@ fest@@ ed in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or or chi@@ ves ) , de@@ cel@@ eration and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections , which have been demonstr@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because alarm go does not work against this type of infections may not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient insi@@ sts on treatment for two to three days , the doctor should be investig@@ ating investig@@ ating patients and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the major indi@@ ces of efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was cancelled after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds , about 90 % of patients were treated with both groups .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of waste ( failed cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infections which have been det@@ ectable , or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common tri@@ bution with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a coefficient of irrit@@ ation at the order .
the conclu@@ ding Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go during the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections opposite the risks : • Imp@@ et@@ igo , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mary , de@@ cks or gen@@ aly@@ te wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the market traffic of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who have no improvement in cases within two to three days are supposed to be considered again and an alternative treatment will be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sen@@ si@@ zing or heavy local irrit@@ ation through the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be broken off , the sal@@ be carefully ab@@ outs and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections where M@@ RSA is known as nar@@ re@@ ger or assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in secondary operations the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , which caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) .
an alternative treatment is supposed to be considered if a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment does not occur any improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to its small plasma concentration , which were achieved when people were achieved on a di@@ ced skin or in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally super@@ ficial wounds , clin@@ ically important shirts are not expected in vivo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max gradually increased to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be to a di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men around 81 % .
due to small system@@ ic exposure according to top@@ ical application in patients can not be maintained when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive tox@@ icity after oral intake and are in@@ adequate regarding a statement regarding impact on the birth and the red@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used only during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is recommended in the gift of an system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ otic .
in the decision whether the breast@@ feeding / terminated / terminated or termin@@ ating the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is possible between the benefit of the breast@@ feeding and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most frequently reported side effects of Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the administration place , which is about 1 % of patients .
effects of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic c@@ ate of P@@ and@@ ro@@ util@@ in , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the effect of the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ors of the bacterial protein synthesis due to a certain binding place of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes , which differs from the binding bos@@ om of other anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the bin@@ ders of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 is involved in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om P @-@ binder and the Pep@@ tide transferred centre .
by joining this binding agent P@@ and@@ ro@@ util@@ ine the Pep@@ per@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block some P @-@ binder inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler shel@@ ters .
due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some inf@@ ectious diseases , a consultation by experts should be targeted .
there were no differences in in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the ins@@ ist is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ appe@@ aling to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ al factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption in a study involving healthy adults has been applied 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and lowered skin for up to 7 days .
of 516 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary wounds , individual plasma samples were gained .
rehear@@ sal was performed on the days 3 or 4 during adult patients each prior to the medi@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of the people after top@@ ical application of 1 % Sal@@ be put down to 200 cm2 ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver mic@@ ros@@ omes was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , among low involvement of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out more than 14 days , there were evidence of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .

there was neither male respon@@ ding in female rats for reduced fertil@@ ity at oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in the highest exposure of exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 cm2 with di@@ ced skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study on rats were diagnosed with oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development of tox@@ icity ( reduced body weight of the mo@@ cker ) and matern@@ al tox@@ icity .

Am@@ bi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases related to the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not yet immune to these two diseases .
Am@@ bi@@ rix is applied within two doses of vacc@@ ines , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Am@@ bi@@ rix can only be used when immun@@ isation is a lower risk of hepatitis B infection , which is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be led out of two doses .
if a collecting dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Am@@ bi@@ rix or other Hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by causing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as opposed to a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
am@@ bi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ inated vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and the vaccine Twin@@ rix Kids since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of one of three doses .
because Am@@ bi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults are also based as a cover for the application of Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed one month after the last injection a protective anti @-@ body concentration .
in an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vacc@@ ination was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
am@@ bi@@ rix led to hepatitis A and B after the last injection of a month after the last inj@@ ections to the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Am@@ bi@@ rix was in a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between inj@@ ections similar .
the most common adverse events of Am@@ bi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ aches , appet@@ izer , pain on injection , red@@ ness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
in patients , Am@@ bi@@ rix must react to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) to be applied .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ y.@@ o. a approval for the placing of Am@@ bi@@ rix in the entire European Union .
the standard dim@@ pl@@ ying plan for the Grun@@ dim@@ pl@@ ying with Am@@ bi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a restri@@ ctive surgery is required for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination @-@ simulation .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ body values are observed in the same size order , according to vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not completely secured whether the immune expert persons spoke to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination , because they are also protected against the immune memory via the immune memory .
3 As for all inj@@ ections , for the rare case of an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction , according to the gift of vacc@@ ination , corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard dim@@ pl@@ unge f@@ ema is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B Surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ ruption of the immune system there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies resulting in these cases the gift of additional vacc@@ ines may be required in these cases .
since a intra@@ oral injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal import effect , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , am@@ bi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ie or blood disorders , as it can be inj@@ ected in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift .
if Am@@ bi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular der@@ ision type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined meas@@ ur@@ - m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens is sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ om@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immun@@ defects must be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted using 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , tube , sw@@ elling , we@@ ather@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative in@@ hal@@ ation .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines of Am@@ bi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 im@@ prints at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Am@@ bi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ cans combined cycle .
the only exceptions were the higher Frequ@@ encies of pain and Mat@@ ter on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Am@@ bi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Am@@ bi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects following the gift of a 3 @-@ cans combined dose .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination process , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given Am@@ bi@@ rix were vacc@@ inated against pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination .
the frequency of Mat@@ ter was however similar ( i.e. above the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects who received Am@@ bi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ cans combination .
the pre@@ valence of pain and pain was low and comparable to the combination of the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines .
in a comparative study of 1- 11 @-@ year @-@ old im@@ pregn@@ ation , the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actions and general actions in the Am@@ bi@@ ri@@ x@@ ology was comparable to that with the 3 @-@ cans combined combination with 360 ELISA and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , during the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , vacc@@ ination with am@@ bi@@ rix had a frequency of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ tape .
the proportion of im@@ pregn@@ ation causing severe side effects during the 2 doses of vacc@@ ines with am@@ bi@@ rix or during the 3 doses of vacc@@ ines with 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant@@ ine Hepatitis B Surface an@@ tigen , was not different .
in clinical trials , which were carried out at im@@ flow at the age of 1 to including 15 years , were the ser@@ cont@@ ingent rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ op@@ o@@ vers@@ ation rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two cans of Am@@ bi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination with three doses .
in the 289 people whose immun@@ ity was imp@@ aired , the serum ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 , according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose im@@ pur@@ ities significantly higher than with Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the immun@@ ity , which were achieved in a clinical study of 1- 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the im@@ bur@@ ners were either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines with am@@ bi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with a combination of 360 ELISA and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant@@ ine Hepatitis B Surface an@@ tigen .
in persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with am@@ bi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immun@@ ode@@ ficiency reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination @-@ simulation , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study on 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are shown 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine is comparable to the vacc@@ ination of 0 @-@ 12 months .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al @-@ rich food and beverages but may also be transmitted by other ways , as well as by bathing in water @-@ cont@@ am@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , blu@@ ish face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may not make a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Am@@ bi@@ rix can not protect themselves completely from an infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series with 2 doses has been completed .
if you are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ ines , Am@@ bi@@ rix is already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( though you feel not un@@ well or sick / feels ) a vaccine may not prevent disease .
a protection against other infections which may cause the liver or symptoms which are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection that may not be convey@@ ed .
• If your child has already been an allergic reaction to Am@@ bi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction is expressed by ju@@ ck@@ ering skin envelop@@ es , breathing need or weak@@ nesses of face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you have an allergic infection with a fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the completion of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of vacc@@ ination with am@@ bi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is administered as a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection before termination of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Am@@ bi@@ rix will suffer from people who suffer heavy blood disorders caused by the skin and not in the muscle is inj@@ ected . • if you are weak@@ ened with a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense / or if you / your child is under@@ lined by a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Am@@ bi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction is on to vacc@@ ination .
21 Tell your doctor if you can take another medicine / pound ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without dis@@ rup@@ tions ) or if you have been given without dis@@ rup@@ tions / or received Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) or that is planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine , and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Am@@ bi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated with separate places and as possible as possible different li@@ mb@@ s .
when Am@@ bi@@ rix ought to be given the same time or shortly before or after injection of Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ines , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Am@@ bi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women are not administered , except it is ur@@ gently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Am@@ bi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , please talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 c@@ imal doses ) : • pain or complaints at the boarding point or tube • Mat@@ ern@@ ity • head@@ aches • App@@ oint@@ ment • appet@@ izer

Am@@ bi@@ rix is available in packages to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs available in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data provided by the approval of the first approval for the entry level , the CH@@ MP maintained the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Am@@ bi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Am@@ bi@@ rix was only used in a Member State in the Netherlands since May 2003 , the available security data for this product is limited due to small patient exposure .
Ammon@@ ites can also be used in the age of over a month with a complete enzy@@ mes or hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ op@@ tically En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y ( brain damage caused by high am@@ mon@@ y concentrations ) in the pre @-@ history .
Ammon@@ ites is divided into several single doses to meals - split , under the food , or via a gast@@ ric acid ( through the abdom@@ inal wall in the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a no@@ bl@@ onde ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
there was no comparable study because Ammon@@ ites could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( an agent drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
Ammon@@ ites can also be dischar@@ ged with appet@@ ite , killing pain , head@@ aches , head@@ ache , digest@@ ive problems or taste version , abdom@@ inal pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , imm@@ oral body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the am@@ mon@@ ition of the ur@@ inary treatment of the ur@@ ine cycle was prevented with high am@@ mon@@ y values .
Ammon@@ ites was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this medicine .
the use of all patients is inde@@ xed in all patients where a complete enzyme is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manip@@ ulating form ( un@@ completely enzy@@ mes , which is manifested after the first life month ) , an indication for use if in the An@@ am@@ n@@ nese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually tolerance in consideration of the protein tolerance and the development of the daily protein intake of the patient .
according to the previous clinical experience , the usual daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with body weight over 20 kg as well as for adults and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early solid lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate , or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ skri@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ ir@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ ate synthetic defic@@ iency must receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are not given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as a risk for the emergence of ov@@ ag@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a exists if the tablets do not get in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g. of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , as well as with sodium re@@ at@@ ric cancer cells only with caution .
as met@@ abolic and de@@ position of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with external caution .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see 4.3 ) .
at sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate at young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be determined that phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic of humans are ex@@ di@@ vor@@ ced in breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS will be con@@ inde@@ xed during a n@@ urs@@ ing time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients were at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they did not stand with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ inting patient who developed a met@@ abolic endo@@ thel@@ ia , severe mort@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred within a 5 months old baby @-@ child with an acci@@ dental individual dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms start with the Ac@@ cum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate , which showed an intraven@@ ous ne@@ ural tox@@ icity at@@ icity at an intraven@@ ous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound , con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ ate with glut@@ amine with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine using the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both connections contained 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the loss of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ ine cycle can be assumed that every gram included sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost always inf@@ ist , and the disease caused by treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acid or with their st@@ ick@@ ed anal@@ oga within the first year of life .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , util@@ isation of alternative ways of nit@@ rous oxide ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ y@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ st@@ itution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate as recently as post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first lifetime ) cases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with many for mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a delayed shape of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ in@@ tran@@ sc@@ rub@@ yl@@ ase defic@@ ien@@ ase ) that were treated from a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ial En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet was the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ ien@@ cies are hardly reversible in treatment and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state zone can occur in some patients .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phenol , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is formed .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in an empty healthy adult and in patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repet@@ itive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its Met@@ abol@@ ite was also examined with cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al in tablet form , 15 minutes after intake measured plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ ic cycles or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ opath@@ ic acid was det@@ ectable according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in a plasma .
in three of six patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma concentration were five times higher than after the first gifts .
this medication is di@@ vor@@ ced within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no sound effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules is absorbed by either oral ( infants and children who cannot allow tablets any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gast@@ ric acid or a no@@ bl@@ onde .
according to the previous clinical experience , the usual daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with body@@ work of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with body weight over 20 kg as well as for adults and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early solid lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate , or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ skri@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ ir@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ idal cells of the brain .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ inting patient who developed a met@@ abolic endo@@ thel@@ ia , severe mort@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both connections contained 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the loss of excess
on the basis of investigations about the de@@ position of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ ine cycle can be assumed that every gram included the sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ ien@@ cies are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state zone can occur in some patients .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after intake measured plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
during the period of durability , the patient can temporarily store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this case , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient needs to receive the medicine more than a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzy@@ mes , so that they could not leave the st@@ ick@@ ed waste products , which are not able to ex@@ crete themselves after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory studies , you need to inform the doctor that you may alter AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
for taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs . please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ies if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not a pres@@ cription drug .
during the n@@ urs@@ ing time , you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine could over@@ lap the breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases , tur@@ t@@ ness , head@@ aches , flav@@ our@@ al problems , re@@ proof of the hearing , dis@@ oriented , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical states were observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , please sit immediately with your doctor or with the emergency capacity of your hospital for the introduction of an appropriate treatment .

an@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood pressure on the heart ) , for example with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest strap with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( cardi@@ ac measurement value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ac or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ a@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients , a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart failure to contribute to the heart and enhance the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in sole gift or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with a standard combination treatment with H@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI was compared .
during the PCI , the patients often remains a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a lock ) , and they received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
at the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI was used in the prevention of new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year a total of as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients receiving a PCI was angi@@ ox regarding all the indicators as well as H@@ ep@@ arin , except for severe ble@@ eding , among which it was much more effective than H@@ ep@@ arin .
an@@ a@@ ox can not be applied in patients who may possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it must not be used in patients who recently had a ble@@ eding , as well as people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or cardi@@ ac infection .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an immediate replacement for h@@ ep@@ arin during the treatment of ACS and a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for placing in@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) , when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is carried out in another one , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced inf@@ usi@@ ans dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg was administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of them directly subsequent intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us @-@ gift of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight is required .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted drug should be carefully mixed before use and the bolt dose rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , a further monitor is no longer required , provided , the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg inf@@ usi@@ ans dose is given right .
a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be applied in patients with medium @-@ severe kidney cancer ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose is 0.3 mg / kg and it is necessary to test the ACT 5 minutes after the second half dose .
in patients with medium @-@ severe kidney damage , which led to approval in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the study , the ACT re@@ iter@@ ate 5 minutes after the gift of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without c@@ anned adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .

A@@ pi@@ dra is applied to the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is given sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the upper leg or the upper arm , or as a continuous use of an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not provide sufficient insulin on the control of Glu@@ cos@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or process insulin .
insulin @-@ insulin distingu@@ ishes itself very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter work duration than a short @-@ effective human@@ kind .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body was not able to produce in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ an for the efficacy was the change in substance gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared with a reduction of 0.14 % at insulin @-@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % of human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin @-@ insulin or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must possibly be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood of the blood .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH granted approval for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdom@@ inal ceiling , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection into the field of abdom@@ inal sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection .
due to the reduced Glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and di@@ min@@ ated insulin changes , insulin needs to be lowered with a limitation of the liver function .
any change in action strength , the brand ( cardi@@ ac ) , insulin del@@ ays , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can draw a change in insulin demand .
3 A in@@ adequate dosing or termination of a treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ able diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabet@@ ic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ g ; these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another insulin type or insulin should be done with strict medical supervision , and can change a change in dosage .
the onset of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effect profile of the insulin and can therefore change over the change@@ over of the treatment schem@@ as .
to strengthen the substances that enhance blood gl@@ ucose concentrations , include oral anti@@ diabet@@ ic , angi@@ opath@@ y , fibro@@ sis , fluores@@ cence , fi@@ br@@ ate , fluor@@ o@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ant ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen , sal@@ iz@@ yl@@ ates and sulph@@ ur antibiotics .

heavy hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ias with consciousness can be given by a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Gl@@ ucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a doctor correspon@@ d@@ ingly , or by intraven@@ ous gift of gl@@ ucose through a doctor .
after a gl@@ ucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious mort@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating peripheral gl@@ ucose ( especially through sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as inhibit@@ ing of gl@@ ucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous G@@ ac of insulin inj@@ ul@@ ite occurs faster and the duration is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus showed insulin @-@ relevant dosing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg , a proportional counter @-@ effective effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of the combined effect , just like human@@ kind .
